1,Great when working,I purchased this drive and had great success the first time I used it. The next time I used the drive my troubles started. The Iomega product support is the worst I ever encountered. The tech lines disconnect you when they are busy and the email response is a joke. They do not respond.
2,Crusade/Space Museum,"In a word, vintage! Classic Dr. Who at its best. While only samples of ""The Crusade,"" ""The Lion"" and ""Wheel of Fortune"" give us a taste of the richness of the early Dr. Who stories. There is almost a Shakespearian quality to it. Educational as well as entertaining. And the Space Museum is a trippy ""time gets messed up"" story. It's a lot of fun seeing our heros getting themselves out of this mess. Even Vicki isn't as annoying as she usually is! If you liked anything about early Dr. Who, you've got to have this one!"
1,This book and the author is over-rated,"ALLI have taken the CISSP certification (ACED IT!) and I have read 5 CISSP books. Among all, this book was very thorough and detailed. But, it was extremely misleading and had too much information which were not needed for the exam. If you are planning to take the exam, please BUY the Official ISC2 book. It is OFFICIAL, straight to the point, and written by an instructor who wants you to pass and learn the real deal...Check out this linkLhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/084931707X/qid=1114494943/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-7942902-3864915?v=glance&s;=books&n;=507846Best Wishes.."
1,"WARRANTY DOESN""T APPLY",Beware buying this product through AMAZON.com The 4 year warranty doesn't apply. I've had mine for less than 2 years and this morning it BURNED my hair because the blower isn't working properly. Had I purchased it elsewhere I would have the warranty available to me.
1,jade green; ghost story or wuss story???,"this was a very, very disappointment. i do not recommend this book to anyone, not even myself!!!!"
1,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE BOOK","This is one of the worst romance novels I have ever read. There was no romance. OMG! The characters were corny, the plot was stupid. Just a whole lot of back and forth mess about a wager. To top it off it was completely boring. The only sex scene in the entire book was at the end on the last 3 pages. I can't believe I read this crap!!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible Customer Service. I paid but did not recieve the item!,"I ordered this Barn Scrapper and never received it. I called them and they sent me ""JUST"" the handle and no tool! I called them again and they sent me ""JUST"" the handle again! I kept telling them to only send me the tool but they would not work with me. Do not do business with them as they just don't care. I wish I had a better review, but bad business is just bad business. I paid my money and after 6-months I still have not received what I paid for and never will."
1,i've had better,dubble bubble has to be the worst buble gum ever invented. the moment you pop it in you mouth you can already taste the awful after-taste. and this crap is most rubbery than anything else.
2,Great Christmas Season Show,"This show is great for the whole family, warm story, and has lots of laughs. The Actors for the movie seem to just make the show!"
2,makes a very good coffee and super espresso,we are very impressed with this coffee. I know we will be buying this for a long time to come. All and all a great product.
2,Book Review,The sale was quick and fast. The product arrived as described and was in excellent condition. Company was easy to do bussiness with. Great product!!
1,Don't bother....,This book was boring and painful to read. The characters were flat and I found myself not caring about them at all. I had to force myself to finish it because I kept hoping it would get better. But it didn't.
1,Gag,I liked the show. Haven't watched it in years. Put the movie in. I want to vomit at how disgusting it is. I literally want to punch the TV in the face. This is really garbage.
1,Terrible...kindle version,"This is for the kindle version. Not the actual book: Odd bits and pieces. Much of it was unreadable due to translation errors. Missing pages, stops in the middle of a section. Don't buy."
2,an unknown gift...,"I'm not really into this kind of music, but this harp music is very elusive and well crafted. The pieces sing to you and take you on a journey."
2,"AH, THE MEMORIES","As an aging hippie, this album brings back sooo many memories. The songs are also extremely relevant today since so many of Leon's early works were protest songs over the Vietnam war.The CD itself doesn't have the best sound quality - hasn't been enhanced at all - but it is as good or better than the old vinyl album.If you want to get an old hippie on his/her feet dancing, put on this CD and crank up the sound all the way."
1,Shedding Light on The Book The City of Ember,The City of Ember's plot is there is a girl named LIna. She is discovering that the city is running low on supplies. Lina is always dreaming of a new city that is ten times better. The city is also underground and is only light by lights that go on and off at certain times. Lina really wants to leave the city. I liked that there was alot of characters. It was fun because you could see who did what. I disliked that there wasn't enough action. This book is just as good as The People of Sparks. It is really interesting because its like The City of Ember.
2,The eight human talents,"One of the most perfect books ever written. I know it has new ideas that many may not be used to but, give it a chance let go of the skepticism. It is life transforming. Do the exercises and the meditations. Just do it!!!!!!!"
1,It broke!,"This was my second cordless optical mouse I purchased for my laptop after the wheel broke on my first. After about 2 months, my laptop stopped recognizing the usb device and then the usb stopped communicating with the mouse alltogether. Hoping it was still under warranty, I attempted to contact Microsoft tech support, but they didn't seem to recognize the number of my product. I now have a new logitech mouse that works fine that was about the same price, but a much better value. I would not purchase this mouse."
2,precioso!!!!!!!!,"Emily!!! I love it!!! es mi tercer año que compro el calendario, me fascina todo lo que sea de Emily!!!"
1,ted,I If you like foul mouthed teddy bears you'll love this farce but for me. It was wasn't worth the rental price
2,Lo mejor.....,"es una recopilación muy bien lograda, ya que abarca todas las etapas de la banda. Para los fanaticos es una obra de colección y para el resto es la obra para conocerlos y disfrutarlos..."
1,VERY Unsatisfied Customer,"My first review becs i'm VERY Unsatisfied.Only used this for 1 week and the bag that it came with ripped open and all the powder is out loose. Not a good product. I went back to Liquid Grip instead. Don't get this... i'd give this negative 3 stars if i could. The only reason why i put 1 star is becs i can't post w/o any ""rating""."
1,Cry_Help,"At first it was the advertisements that gave me an encouragement to go see this film. So I did. These advertisements were completely false. It opens up with a young girl running from an unknown killer leading her to her death. Ok..it does start off a little promising, but leading to scenery of bad acting, and useless dialogue. It was probably the worst movie I have seen this year. It doesnt even come close to a scary movie. I have noticed how people have said that horror does not need violence to entertain, which I totaly agree with. But for god sake, it needs something. This has nothing. With one of the most rediculous, rubbish endings I have ever seen in a long time. Stay away from this pile of garbage."
2,Joey Lawrence! Rare and Out of Print!,"The Title says it all Nothin' My Love can't fix and you'll believe it after hearing Joey sing! He needs to do some with old standards. THIS IS EXTREMELY RARE, OUT OF PRINT AND NOT AVAILABLE ON CD!"
2,Good old days,The Pranks and pleasures of youth. Sometimes it is fun to look back at the foolishness of youth. It sure was fun.
2,now,"now this is what I am talking about. She can sing some sad ballads boy, get your tissues ready. Her voice does sound like anita baker but lets get over the comparisons. This album will last for decades."
2,Waited all my life for this,"I am just as inspired now as 40 years ago with this series. I am so happy to find it on DVD - clear, without commercials, able to freeze the spell-binding photography, able to go back over the lessons of pure poetry. What a treat with the guest stars as well: a little Jodie Foster, José Feliciano, Leslie Nielsen and many others. This series is a beautiful necklace of precious gems. If it seems trite or campy now, it is only because so many have borrowed from it, e.g. ""Expect the unexpected."""
2,Can't screw it up,"The clay is very pliable and easy to work with--leaving behind a smooth, even finish. I've heard that it's easy to ruin the paint on your car if you're not careful. However, Pinnacle's clay bar isn't heavy-duty enough to mess it up as long as you apply liberal amounts of lubricant. Doing this for the first time myself, I found it easy and pretty straight forward.Only one real complaint: the bottle of lube is only good for one application. I used 3/4 or more. Would rather have the option to buy 2 bottles instead of 2 clay bars. The bar will last for a least 2 applications. It's entirely possible that I used too much... but it's better to err on the side of too much than too little lubricant.As for Palm Beach Motoring Accessories (the company who fulfilled the order): stand-up job. They got me the kit before the time expected, which made me very happy. They're easy to work with. I'll be sure to use them again."
1,Pass on this one,"I wish I had seen all of these mediocre reviews before I bought this (in my local store, sorry Amazon). I picked this up after reading that they were the openers on the last Brian Jonestown Massacre tour. But fans of those guys (or any modern psych or garage influenced music), be forewarned--this is a forgetable dud.These songs aren't timeless, they're just endless..."
2,Thank you Pastor Mark Gungor.,It's been a year before I finally buy this but when I buy have my own copies and watch this perfect I learn alot of things you are a blessing thank you for sharing your gift to us.
2,The Help,Must see movie! Story is well told and right to the point of what the women when thru. Shows the nasty-nice bullying that women do so gracefully. I wish all to see and understand and fight against that kind of abuse-bullying.
1,"Nothing like Original Crank, A Total Disappointment!!","I absolutely loved the first Crank. It was full of action and humor. It kept you on the seat of your pants the whole time. The second one? Horrible. If you're looking for a second Crank like the first, don't watch this one. It was horrible with the ""special effects"" they added. It was cheesy. I was so excited to see this movie, and it ended up a waste of time. I just wanted to shut off the movie. Why would you go and take a great first movie and ruin it. I'm so glad I did not spend money to see this in a theater. I sincerely hope they don't make another Crank. If they do, they need to revert it back to the original movie. If it's anything like the second movie, I see a box office bomb waiting to happen. I can't even begin to describe how unhappy I am with this movie."
1,Absolutely Awful,"This book was absolutely awful, not sure if the other reviewers were reading the same book. If you like witchcraft and fairytales, this one is for you! Be Real, or at least Pretend To Be. The storyline, may have been okay without the witchcraft, or ""special powers"". I was truly disappointed."
1,"Great music, but not great sound quality!","I have fond memories of Captain Rock's music, and it's nice to support the old school artists and see compilations like this, but I can't help feeling a little ripped off in this case. As mentioned in a couple of the other reviews, the sound quality is very poor and you can hear clicks and pops in places, so it's probably been recorded from vinyl.Cosmic Glide (Captain Rock's first release) is missing, and Cosmic Blast and Return Of Captain Rock aren't the full length mixes you'll find on the 12""s.What could have easily been a 5 star CD is only getting 2 stars from me, which is a real shame."
2,Cheasapeake,Very interesting story line so far. Good look at the history of the area. Having lived in the Virginia Tidewater area for some years I can appreciate the history and see a lot of the area in my mind from the book. He seems quite visually accurate.
2,Guns Galore,"S.W.A.T. DVDSamuel L. Jackson stars as the leader of a S.W.A.T team with Colin Farrell as his assistant in a high action, thrill a minute movie with more exotic guns and other weapons than you can count. Supposedly a very realistic movie, I wouldn't know, I`ve never been a member of a a S.W.A.T team and wouldn't want to be either.The Team escorts an international criminal to prison who has publicly offered a very large reward ($100 million) to anyone who can get him free. Highly recommended to fans of Samuel L. Jackson and S.W.A.T teams.Gunner March, 2008"
2,Good book!,This was one of my favorite books I have read. It will make you want to keep reading to the end.
2,Great for senior,"Got this just to have an incentive to work out. Really enjoy that it is geared to the older adult, Exercises are easy to follow and just the right time length to get me going in the morning"
2,Great iPod,"A great way to carry your favorite songs, pictures and videos.Only down side to this system is the itunes software. It's cumbersome to load your existing MP3's into the player."
2,"Good, fast-paced fun","Think Duke Nukem 3D, but with more action. This game will keep you on your toes the whole way through. Every now and then, monsters spawn in from all directions when you enter a room/collect a powerup. The challenge is learning to take cover when your entrance to the battlefield is usually the worst possible strategic location (for you).Multiplayer mode is phenominal. You can play network, split screen, or network AND split screen. There's only one battle arena that comes with the game, but cooperative mode is a blast.Graphics go smooth; it's Directx7. If you've got a high end pc, this game does let you crank it up to some sweet visuals.Difficulty range is wide. It goes anywhere from playing invincible (boring) or with easy spawns to playing with huge hordes of aliens.Overall, if you like First Person Shooters with action and attitude, get this."
1,Not The Best Home Alone...,"Home Alone 3 is a great family movie, but it's not the same as Home Alone 1 & 2 were. First of all when you bring in a new kid in the 3rd film, it's not gonna be the same type of movie, because the kid is different and most importantly the bad guys are different. I mean how dumb do these bad guys have to be when they chase a remote control car and they can't catch up to it. At least in Home Alone 1 & 2 the plans were more believeable and fun to watch. If you are planning on buying this film..... PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY. I hope they dont make Home Alone 4 because I already had enough of Home Alone 3."
2,Great sound,Best sound ever for my videos and Google+ hangouts. No background noise. Very high quality. Exceeded my expectations dramatically. Excellent product.
1,This whiteboard is HORRIBLE,"It does NOT ""dry erase"" at all. It requires a ridiculous amount of rubbing or a spray of some cleaner to get the marker off. It defeats the whole purpose. Besides that, it is fine >:-/"
2,One Great Mystery!,"I felt that this book was one that I should add to my personal collection. It was well written, as well as fast-paced. Gilbert Morris did a great job with the details of the plot, and had me guessing right up to the end. Danielle and Ben are quite a duo, and I can never tell what Morris will have them do next! I suggest that anyone who likes Gilbert Morris or mysteries should definetly read this book!"
2,Fascinting and Scary,In this digital age there really is no way to hide. Even in a country as corrupt as Colombia where Pablo owned half the police force and most of the judicial he couldn't stay on the lam forever. Modern tyrants and Kleptocrats in Africa manage to stay in power for decades without justice catching up with them. The US DEA went after Pablo with everything they had and it was only a matter of time before they found him - makes you sort of wonder why they can't find Osama Bin Laden? If Osama had been running drugs instead of hijacking airplanes maybe the US would have caught him.
2,Perfect size and height for patio coffee table.,"This table is about twice the table you would expect at the price. Its size is ideal with a 2 passenger teak bench. Kompur wood is so like teak; we're staining our teak furniture to match the Kompur wood. It looks marvelous with the 30"" round folding table. Fit and finish are A Plus. Can't rate durability yet or it would have 5 stars."
1,F*** JOSE,Fat joe fat a** this album is one of the wroste albums ever.howcome he can say Ni*** and he is Latino this fat a** dude.TonySunshine is on 8 or more tracks.i hope he gets better.Fat A**
1,Biff where have you been?,"I, too, am a great fan of ""A Thorn in Mrs. Rose's Side"". I especially love the song ""Molly"". I have been looking for the CD and do hope that someone will re-release it on CD for all of Biff's fans. Looking forward to the new CD, but haven't heard it yet."
2,WHY ARE SOME OF THE REVIEWS SO LOW???????!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a pretty good movie, and I don't see why the average customer rating can be four or five stars. It's a great movie, except for the fact that the part(...) Pretty good movie, all in all. Four stars."
1,Structurally sound but,"This is a good binder. I only did not work for me because the width only is enough to fit 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper. If you wish to include tab dividers the will protrude past the width of the binder. Also the expansion is limited in that you start from 3"" and expand to 5"" inches. The binder cannot collapse smaller than 3"". So as long as these two items are not an issue, it is sturdy and durable"
1,Disapointment,"FOr anyone who has played the original SegaCd version, we all know this game was entirely a disapointment. The lack of the amazing original soundtrack and the subtle changes in story line ruined this game for me."
1,Bad Book Printing,This book had cut off pages and faded print I was very disappointed. Would not recommend to anyone. If it wasn't such a pain I WOULD return it.
1,Useless,I have ordered this book for possible trainning of new employees. There is nothing applied in this book. I was looking for help to explain with examples when can be used and related limits of formal project management tools. If you are looking for this type of information just forget it
2,Excellent: authoritative and user-friendly,"This is the finest single-volume history of Hungary in the English language. Highly recommended work, by one of the most incisive historians of central and south-eastern Europe around."
1,Horrible smell,"I too bought these and kept smelling something unusual. I think it must be the way they rubber is bonded to the steel. I am going to return if I can. I can't subject the cats to this awful smell. If I can smell it, you know it is worse for them. Liked the bowl otherwise. Too bad."
1,The date in the description doesn't match the pictured item.,"Make sure to check the edition year you need before buying! The description says 1987, which is NOT the year of the edition that is pictured here on this listing! I ordered without noticing that small detail. I gave it one star, because it is a misleading product posting - I can't rate the prodcut that I THOUGHT I was buying (based on the picture), because that is not what I received."
1,Not Happy in NJ,"The shipper committed to delivery between 8:00-12:00, they failed to meet their commitment.The color is much more red then shows on line, was thinking a rich brown but has a definite red hue.The draws are completed cheaply; very light weight and glued together and I was under the impression they were dovetailed. All eight draws had debris inside them which I cleaned out because I didn't want any Chinese bugs hatching! I hope they are not imbedded..."""
2,God does lead us!!,"This book is great for someone going through tough times. God does lead us! Just like he led me to this book. Robert Morgan does a great job of making this book easy to read, but emotionally charged! If your looking for light in a world of darkness this is it. Why do you think your reading this review? God is leading you!!!!"
2,The Last Boleyn,"I will look up more books by Karen Harper now. Gold information about the forgotten Boleyn daughter, Mary. How she was used as a pawn to keep the King's attention. But earned the King's trust through her honesty which was not done during that time. Henry the VIII seemed to appreciate her honesty. Good book..good for Mary Boleyn..so much for Anne."
1,Poor Quality!!! Made In Mexico!!!,"This roaster was of very poor quality, Made in Mexico! The edges were sharp and the exterior was rough. I accidentally rubbed my hand over an area which I didn't know was badly chipped and these sharp metal pieces went into my skin. OUCH!!! I returned this roaster and purchased the Granite Ware 19 inch Covered Oval Roaster instead."
2,Sounder,"In my opinion, ""Sounder"" is an excellent book. It's a book about a black boy growing up with no father and an injured dog in a time of segregation. I liked this book because it is a very emotional book. To me, I felt like I was there with the boy and I could feel his pain. Every move he made, I made with him. If he cried, I cried, if he laughed, I laughed. And though it was a sad book, I enjoy reading about people's lives, whether the book is fiction or non fiction. Therefore, I recommend this book to people who enjoy fiction or non ficton books about people's lives. I also recommend this book to people who like reading about black people and white people who were prejudice. And for me, a person who doesn't like to read, a book has to be pretty good if I like it. And this book I like."
2,Australian Commando in WW2,"This is the story of a group of Australian Commandos from ""Z"" Force sent to rescue a group of diplomats, including a Japanese, whose plane has crashed in the jungle. Stars a VERY young Mel Gibson, John Philip Law, and Sam Neill as the Commandos. It's a race against time as to who will get to the crash site first...the Commandos, the native partisans, or the Japanese. Starts somewhat slow but builds up to the final shootout with the Japanese. I rated it 5 stars because I like ""commando"" films, however, the real rating should be 3 stars...simply because of the somewhat low budget, the script, and the acting....never the less...it is an OK film. Supposedly based on the real WW2 Australian Commando group ""Z"" Force."
1,"Good product in theory, but beware of plastic parts","I purchased this product, but had to exchange it because the part to tighten the item in place was made of plastic and smushed apart when tighted to the end. The problem happened after the 30 day return so I had no alternative, but to exchange instead of return for credit. I'm cautious with the new one and don't tighten to the end. Great design in theory, but they need to use stronger materials to prevent this from happening again."
2,Stanley 1/2 inch ratchet,Item was purchased as a part of a gift. The recipient was pleased with the selection and the item is in use daily on commercial construction sites by an electrician.
1,"Maybe what you want to hear; but biased, and wrong.","These are very poor arguments. Some may find them persuasive, but logically, they are very poor. If you read even a page of this book and don't recognize this, please read a book on logic and logical fallacies. Don't do it for me, do it for yourself.By the way, if I claim there is such a thing as physical strength [an analogy], quibbling that there is upper body strength and lower body strength is not proof that strength doesn't exist, nor is it proof that the idea of measuring/quantifying a person's (overall) strength can't possibly be of any use. Likewise, pointing to one, two, or even a thousand failed attempts to measure a person's strength is also not proof that strength doesn't exist, nor is it proof that this is not a useful concept (that argument would be very tough logically).Sincerely,Mark D. Stump"
1,took a chance,I enjoy most things Irish and a good 'troubles' movie.Skip this one and save your money-just couldn't buy the plot/acting.
1,not much information,"If you don't have A LOT of martial arts experience, this video is pretty advanced. Showed some basic stuff to do with the fans, but I was expecting more ideas of things to do, how to build a elegant yet intimidating weapos form. That said, I like the fans and since the video have figured out that basically any move you do you can incorporate the fans."
1,1000 yawns,"I know I know I'm supposed to know this ""film"" is one of throw back 70's gore and ""art"" if you will. But please...It appeared Zombie couldnt figure out how to make a simple horror film. If the movie stayed with Spaulding's place and made that the resting place for good ole gore, this flick would have had a scarier image and ending. Instead its off we go to an ole farm house where the gore family is sliced and diced amongst many pictures of blurry, wildly colored up ""scary"" images that's supposed to give you a kick and a good ole scream. Instead this one gave me a good ole yawn. I did watch the whole movie through though. That's should be enough to say..go ahead and see this one..for no other reason as to see why you dont make films such as this one. wow. Had the flick been as cool as the poster art this one would have great."
1,Not what I thought.,I liked the start of the book and some parts in the middle but the characters I didn't like and there were too many of them. Glen and the others just weren't drawn up enough to be believable people. I also couldn't stand the nonstop references to the Aztec towns and stuff. Everytime a good part would happen and there was exitment the author would end the chapter and start another one. The ending was terrible too. In spite of all that it wasn't a totally bad read and I never had to force myself to keep reading.
2,"wow, what a great movie","I realy love a prequil that ties the whole thing together and can not wait to see where they went off to in the new series, hope hope hope."
1,Not very diverse,I did not find this book very diverse regarding hairstyles. It has a lot of variations of the same types of styles. Not good if you are looking for different types of braids.
2,Great service,My wife has been using this product for long and she is quite happy with the results. I always order it in amazon and get it on time. I would like to receive more goodies next time as this is the way my wife learnt about this product.
2,not universally compatable,"while not so much the fault of the disks themselfs but rather the -rw format itself. You may find earlier (older) dvd drives including set top boxes will not read this format.i use -rw's more for replay on the burner then for use on set top boxes, or for sending to family and friends. Using them to get the format and feel then burn to a -r disk. This is the most availble brand and is recomended for most inhouse uses. I find the -r the most compatable, and the +rw format the least."
2,Love this show!,So glad I got the 8th season to complete my collection! I can't wait to keep watching until the end of the show!
2,Good enough.,"If you're using this with a Pioneer AVH-4300DVD, beware! I had to cut the inner lip off of the upper beam in order to have enough clearance to open the face to insert a DVD or SD card. It also doesn't sit flush. In a way, I kind of like that because it covers the Pioneer logo on my head unit, and passers-by may think I have a cheaper unit that's less worth the effort of breaking into my car for. Maybe I'm just rationalizing. At any rate, I think the problem is more with the head unit mounting location than with this install kit, but the modification has to be made to the kit if you want to make it work."
2,Good for homeschooling,"This series is a superb synopsis of American history. Examines both sides of issues, relates the backstory rationale for events and what was occurring elsewhere simultaneously. Finding myself as the mom/teacher caught up in the stories as well. Only complaints: some overlap between books instead of completely linear; and wish there were a study guide/TM and tests.Using with other ""living history"" books/bios, and a wall timeline. Had tried Hakim's history ""History of US"" series (too dead-white-Christian-male bashing and too many inaccuracies) and History Channel's ""A History of America"" DVD (too revisionist). This series makes the facts interesting and relative."
2,"An intrigring, and catching book!",This book was so exiting that I couldn't put it down that I read it in two days! The words and details held my attention throughout the whole book. I couldn't put it down until I found out the mysteries behind the letters. I hope there is a sequel to this book that fills in the gaps between Mandy's and Tracey's letters.
2,the bad begining,"I would recommend this book to children under the age of 11.There is so much tension that I nearly stayed up all night.I would never know what would happen next (neither do Violet,Klaus or Sunny). The story begins with three happy children!but don't be fooled by the warm hearted begining! The book is jam packed with UNFORTUNATE EVENTS.!!!!"
2,Great for air travel!,I travel a lot on business and have used Bose headsets on international flights in the past. These Audion-Technical headphones deliver equal or better sound and noise suppression for half the cost. Best travel investment I've made in a long time.
1,"Terrible, just horrible.","Hands down one of the worst movies I have ever watched. It wasn't factual, the actors stunk, and the quality was horrible. A total rip-off."
1,Not noise reducing,I bought these specifically for the noise reduction. They don't reduce noise anymore than normal earbuds. Sound quality is very good and they feel cheap. The one plus is that they are fairly comfortable. I bought the e2c from shure for noise reduction and they do a much better job at reducing noise and are higher quality.
2,good review of etiquette,"There is nothing new here, but the author provides a good review of the timeless and obvious - yet oft forgotten - manners and etiquette of professional and formal social interaction.I listened to the Audible version narrated by the author and I would recommend all professionals listen to it once a year or so..."
1,A book that belongs on the back shelves of the library,"I was looking in this book for some answers about the harmful effects of marijuana. But rather found what amounted to outdated propaganda (1970's) from a doctor that never used the drug and never came to any definitive scientific conclusions regarding its so called ""disastrous"" effects.Throughout the book he consistently mentions the weaknesses in the studies he sites that purport weed as being harmful. He also mentions studies such as the large scale Jamaican studies that either report no harmful effects or improved abilities. Yet the good doctor continues to to evangelize weed as being extremely dangerous to our society. Maybe the danger is that if more people smoked there would be less starch shirted, inflexible, egg heads like himself."
1,You get what you pay for,"I ordered two of these because they were so cheap. Neither one worked very well. On one set, I could only get sound out of one ear bud no matter what I did. On the other set, I could get sound out of both. I only use them for listening to audio books and music on my cell phone. I'm not able to actually use them to talk on my phone. I have a Motorola 9q. I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume. I don't plan on buying these again."
2,Highly recommended,"We bought one of these for our large office kitchen. It's worked beautifully and has seen a lot of use. A product that can withstand multiple users is a recommended product in my book. We have had various products to heat water over the years and they all wore out or broke in a year or so. One appliance we tried had the heating element inside the carafe and gave the water a burned plastic taste. The Proctor Electric Kettle is over 2 years and works like new.My only complaint (and why it didn't get five stars) is how the lid opens - I have problems with that since it doesn't tilt all the way open to make adding water as easy as possible. But it opens wide enough to fit under the faucet. The unit sits nicely on its base. I like that the cord isn't attached to the carafe itself - that's a positive safety and style feature.There are pricier models of electric kettles that look more elegant that may have more bells and whistles, but for the price, this one is well worth the money."
1,More like The Snore.,"OK, it's Corman so you gotta cut him some slack, but this one couldn't terrify a tourist in Disneyland. Karloff is you're typical SOB--Scary Old Baron; Nicholson's a miscast as a lovestruck Napoleanic officer (French lieutenant? Stick to LA gumshoe, Jake.); and what about that Community Theater witch?! Maybe they should have burned the sets down while filming--a la Gone with the Wind--in order to add some excitement to this one."
2,"""Wolf Rider""","I think Wolf Rider was great because it created excitment in the first few pages of the book.The setting is mostly in the apartment and on the college campus and in Andy's school.The main characters are mostly Andy, Nina, Jeoy's Dad, and Dr. Lucus.Some interesting plot lines is when Andy is trying to get out of Dr. Lucus' car ,and some others are when Dr. Lucus calls and says he just killed somebody."
1,Remaster my ...,"Have waited a long time for this to be released but Eone did such a horrible job on this series that I'll just record it off of Antenna TV. Color is washed out and obvious that it came from film. Remastered is a joke, may be digital but all the junk from film came with it including degradation. The b roll shots are fuzzy beyond belief."
1,Not Impressed,"I'm a transexual woman who has lived as a woman for the last 12 years. I've never once dated a man and have remained true to my spouse of 35 years. This woman makes statements that simply aren't true. I know dozens of transexuals and gay men and women who are in commited relationships and have been for years. Just because Alice wants to sleep with dozens of men, doesn't mean we all do. The other thing she forgot to mention in her book is that most crossdressers are straight and married or single and looking for a woman that understands. Alice has done our community a diservice in writing this book."
1,LUDACRIST SUCKS!,What a dumb ass! stand up is the worst song i have ever heard in my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! dont buy this cd it sux...you no wut all his cd's suck...i hate anyone who even listens to rap...u actualy think it takes any skill to be a rapper...listen to any song that travis barker is drumming on and youll understand what i mean
1,worthless,"I ordered 2 of these, one doesn't work at all. The other one has an A button that sometimes acts a B button."
1,"Not bad, not great....","As other reviewers have stated, this is a good book for a broad, superficial review, however, the cognitive, experimental, and diagnostic sections are not sufficient prep for the GRE exam - they are too basic and brisk and do not reflect what is actually on the exam. I got a 730, but I did so by looking at the Kaplan book (despite its mistakes galore) but most importantly reviewing my old textbooks. It's a challenging exam, but with good preparation you can beat it. Good luck!"
2,An absolute must!,"This is Green's 1979 solo comeback after pulling himself out of self-imposed exile and a destructive lifestyle. It is an absolute must for not only Green fans but any fan of the blues, although Green starts spreading out a bit, such as in the delightful ""Funky Chunk,"" one of the 5 instrumentals on the album. The vocal ""A Fool No More"" is pure blues and is a showcase for Green's distinctive vibrato guitar style. Subsequent releases by Green, including those with the Splinter Group, unfortunately suffer somewhat by degradation of Green's voice, but you won't hear that here."
2,"remade on ""the Dinosaurs""","The first time i heard this story was when i saw ""The Ballad of Narayama"", the second time was when i saw ""The Dinosaurs"" by Jim Henson Production. I read about this movie in an article of the new movie ""the Savages"". I couldn't remember the name of the movie till now. I can't wait to see it again."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"Not a heavy, professional grade juicer. Wobbly fittings. I'm afraid if I apply too much pressure, something will bend. Amazon sells this type under a variety of names. Mine reads Prime Cookware Citrus Juicer PPD50J. Made in China."
1,"Radio works, cassette does not work!!!!","the product looked very nice when I first opened the package, however, the first time I used it, the radio worked but the cassette ruined two of my tapes"
1,Crude Tool,1. Not a very well made machine.2. Trying to add all of the options is impossible.3. The expander cannot be bolted into the machine.4. The drill bits are poor quality and difficult to install and use.5. The handle to pull the drill bit into the material is hard to pull. No touch at all using the handle.6. The machine came all greasy and was difficult to wipedown. It was a mess.7. It was easier to setup my drill press and use than using this machine.
1,I have 2006,It is better as it comes on a CD and the Graphics and play calling are great but the biggest pet peeve i have is you cannot save a game whikle playing and it is easy to hit a button and take your self off the game which like i said the game does not save games so if you are at 1:00 to go in the fourth quarter and you hit a wrong button you lose your game and must start over. EA is a cheap company that really should be held accountable for this garbage packaging No manual either have to download that. Way to expensive.
1,Three stars - Much to generous!,"The reviewer of this ""Old propaganda documentary"" is much to generous awarding three stars.Simply put. One star is much too generous! Not only should this a zero star be offered free - Amazon should offer to pay us to watch it!"
1,Skip This Book,"I have recently read Dangerous Love by Ben Okri, which was a stunning novel-the writing and imagery was superb. I thought Astonishing the Gods was just the opposite. The writing was abysmal, contrived, silly--I had to force myself to get through it, kept waiting for it to turn around. It brought to mind the worst of B novels. I couldn't believe the same author had written both of these books. In fact I still can't believe it.I say skip it and go directly to his other works."
1,madonna can do better,come on celine dion give us a break u sounds terrible and u look terrible! madonna can do better than u and also britney spears is coming after u ! hahahaha! coco lee the new girl in the industry is gonna take away your throne!@!
1,Maybe S.B. next book will be better,"Sandra Brown, this isn't one of your best. The story line got old real fast. The love you bestored on these teenagers was a everlasting love, they were willing to fight for that love. They held strangers at gun point for that love. Then in the finally page it was, WHAT!!! Sabra and the baby go home to stay with her mother, (who by the way was only mention twice in the whole story) and Ronnie is in the hospital and will live with his father for awhile. They postpone their love to see if ""can stand the test of time for couple of years apart""!!!!! How and when did Tiel and the Doc fall in love. I must have missed the steamy sex in between the flying bullets part. Those two were so wrong for each other. I surprise they even spoke to each others. This book is a waste of time and money"
2,Great Movie,We have all heard the story and know what happened. Movie brings to life the events that happened that day. Director did a great job bringing the events to life.
2,Great,Reminder that the mylo is targeted to COLLEGE AGED KIDS which where most campuses has wifi everywhere. Not 30 y/o business execs. They have others toys for you guys leave the mylo alone to college kids.
2,Magnificent ...,"To no surprise, this is one of the best performances of Michael Jackson ... captivating and mesmerizing ... there is not a dull moment. Whenever you miss Michael, you can watch this concert and you begin to feel him alive!"
1,Other Books,"No idea why the relatives ever bought me this, but I read it. Big trucks and mining in the middle of nowhere is not for me."
1,Disappointed with this one,"I've read a few of James Patterson's books and enjoyed them. But this one was far beyond disappointing. He had way way way too many characters in this book, so when the murderer was revealed I said what? who? I had to re read back into the chapters to find out which one this guy really was. Sad to say, I didn't like it at all!"
2,A GREAT BOOK,"Daja's book is a great book.Not as good as her others, but it's up there in rank.It's got me waiting for the 4th book.{the one I really want.'Cause it's about Briar!} Had a nice plot, nicely written.One to buy in hardcover! Guess to what will happen in the 4th:Briar and Sandry!What a great match!It's a classic:Noble falls in love with thief."
2,Arrived fast!,This is longer than most similar products and works great to get in deep to the drains to get close clogs.
2,"A witty, mysterious romp mixed with intrigue :)","Logston has outdone herself as she sets the scene for the two other Shadow novels. Shadow is witty, mischevious, daring and jovial, and gives this novel a certain spice that made me want to read it nonstop! I certainly recommend this novel to fantasy lovers who enjoy something set to a different tune once in awhile. A fantastic read!!! :)"
2,Nice Lights!,"I never thought I would have the need for ""designer"" Christmas lights! But I am a candy maker and wanted some peppermint lights to hang in my kitchen. So these are not Christmas lights for me. They add a nice touch to my candy kitchen and I love them! They Rock!Jeff in Boston"
2,Good Steam Cleaner,"Purchased this product to clean original cermanic tile in my 55 year old home. I used it on the kitchen counter, floor and bathroom tile on the wall and counter. I am pleased with the performance of the machine. The little brushes included with the package work well on the grout. This machine gets surfaces clean and does not require chemicals to do it."
2,Excellent!,"This is a WONDERFUL cd of solo and chamber works by this composer. It's amazing how much great music there is out there waiting to be discovered. This guy's music is amazing. It really pulled me in and captivated me. It is approachable, with lots of excitement, but also tons of heart. I'm hooked! Highly recommended!"
1,Stolen idea.,"I got this book only because i was very curious. What i find out ? Almost the whole book, the idea, the ideology is basically stolen from another book.Might is Right - Ragnar Redbeard."
1,NO WAY! 8 Minutes an hour....maybe!,"I bought the book thinking ""horray! finally weight loss as simple as only having to exercise 8 minutes a day, first thing in the morning!"" Sounds easy, sold me. Left me obese!I wish more than anything in this world that losing weight could be as simple as only doing 8 minutes of exercise a day. Great marketing, catching title....little delivery on the promise. This books success formula lies much more in the restrictive calorie diet than in the hyped 8 minutes a day title.What really bugs me about this book is the authors claim that he was once overweight. Give me a break! One picture of a maybe chubby kid, and that picture really doesn't show much of his body, does NOT convince me that he was overweight or knows this struggle first hand as he claims to. He even says ""if I continued to eat at this rate, I would have been over 200 pounds"".Jorge...I am not happy with your book. I feel that you oversold and underdelivered."
1,Wrong product,This product was not what I thought it was and I could not use it. I would like to return the package.
2,Middle of the Pack,"Not one of Robert Earl's best, but certainly not one of the worst. One of those CDs where you really like a few of the songs (Snowin' on Raton, Going Nowhere Blues, Wild Wind), some are worth listening to, and a few are just not really necessary (re-make of ""Road"" with bad singing). Worth buying if you REALLY dig REK, but would not recommend if you are looking for a starting point. For that I would purchase West Textures, Gringo Honeymoon for a start. Those are A+ albums."
2,Cuisinart Chef's Classic Cookware,"I needed new cookware and wanted an affordable, durable, set. I ordered one saucepan from the Chef's Classic collection and immediately fell in love with it. I subsequently ordered the entire basic set. They're very well made, non-stick, and easy to clean. I heartily recommend any product from this Cuisinart set."
1,unhappy custmer,the 3D DVD < CARS 2 > skips and freezes the first time I played it and my kids were very unhappy too. my DVD player is new and works great on other 3D DVD movies including the LIONG KING DVD that I bought with CARS 2.they should replace this defective product and send me a new one
2,This isn't a tool album. Not even close.,"While the singer remains the same, this isn't a Tool album at all. Tool is a heavy, heavy angst driven band. The songs on this album are melodic but, not flowery. Maynard gets to show off his intensity, but, in a different light. Tools tends to play songs that are reactions to situations, while Perfect Circle is more about the situation itself. Desires and feeling that drive the situation. Being a big fan of Tool, it's great to see Maynard explore his music with a different voice."
2,Excellent but...,"I have almost all versions of this recording, including the original Living Stereo LP. Although this recording sounds excellent, specially in SACD, the sound of the original LP and the CD transcript sounds better. The SACD version (this issue) sounds brighter and a little bit rougher than the LP and CD versions. This is a recording I have lived with a long time and know by heart. It is a real showpiece for stereo (the LP and CD versions) for systems. Has a lot of detail and clarity, pace and slam. Fiedler really lived this music. He conducts it, and the orchestra responds with great virtuosity and verve, as is required for this two oeuvres. I recommend both the CD and the SACD without reserves, although the LP I have will never be replaced by any of them."
1,worse than 1 star book,"I only read a few pages of this book,but, then I flipped through the pagesand found some stuff that was notappropriate for the characters' ages to doand for kids my age to read. I think this bookshould go on a ""must not read"" list.I think this book should not be injunior high school libraries."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased the Zoji in 2008. At first, it made good bread. However, after owning it for 6 months, it stopped baking bread correctly. The loaves that would result from the machine were burnt bricks that didn't rise, no matter how I tweaked the settings and changed the ingredients to be sure it wasn't me or anything I was using.I was so disappointed in this machine as I thought it would be superior - two paddles, all kinds of customization options... but none of them worked. The paddles started going wonky on me when I was making dough after the bread baking option crapped out. I Freecycled this unit and won't be buying another one.A shame, really - my best friend had one and she loved it, never had a problem with it. I think that they must not have a consistent production process or parts are faulty as another poster said.I would not buy another one. I had a Breadman before this and was able to use it for about 6 years before it died."
1,Re-Re-Re-Re-Release? PATHETIC!!!!,"Elvis Costello is my favorite artist. He is one of the most prolific and talented artists in the history of music. An incredible concert performer. Sadly, he has also become a shameless gouger of his loyal fan base. He has re-re-re-re-released his catalog over and over and over again, with slight changes and additional outtakes and versions. It has gotten completely out of hand. Elvis, please stop this nonsense."
1,Insipid on the Mississippi,"This book shows it true colors in the end -Southrn Gothic. The daughters in question are cartoon like creations- the dark one-seemingly passionate and full of vice. Even as the author allows us to empathize with her, she is the charicature. The light one- an angel. the dark one speaks in Cruella Deville type cadences and the light one mutters statements- that are never more than two words. The twist- ""Good is really not so good."".If there is artistry in this book, it is in the author's brooding descriptions, but even these become overwrought."
1,Didn't like it,I really disliked this book. I thought the story was very disjointed. There were gaps in the story line and chronology. I am a fan of scifi/fantasy novels but not this one. I purchased this and the sequel based on Amazon recommendations. I will not be reading the sequel. Check this out from the library before you spend your money.
1,tough but poorly written,"I just passed the ACNP exam and used this book as a question bank in addition to the Fitzgerald review course CDs. I would have appreciated more full exams, there are only two 150 question exams, the rest are subject specific. The questions are tough (which is good for mastery) and some are a bit outdated now but my biggest complaint is that the book is poorly written. My husband (a Resident) was helping quiz me and there were several questions that we found the answers to be quite ambiguous or just plain wrong. Additionally the explanation for correct answers is often lacking, not providing rationale for why other answer choices were not correct. Use with caution, this book is good to really drill specific subjects rather than whole tests but watch out for inaccurate answers."
2,Top Notch Variations on Jazz Standards...,"Great product...love the fact that this concert was preserved for the edification of those of us who are Jazz Music lovers!If you like all different styles of of Jazz Variations, from Boogie Woogie, Modern, Bop and even some fleeting touches of modal Jazz, then you will love this concert.Its a great video and even though you can date the concert by the apparel of the participants and the concert goers...the music is timeless and well worth the appreciation."
1,do not buy this brand,"Sent item back to the company and got a rejected mail saying, ""COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS, RETURN TO SENDER"". The company address on the label is:Recoton Accessories, Inc.2950 Lake Emma RoadLake Mary, FL 32746.Made in China"
2,Very unique and awesome blanket.,"I took it on a walk in the rain with my buddy, my entire upper body and arms were completely dry. The material is genius and a solid product. It's great that it also can just be bundled up into a bag and used as a pillow. It's very warm on the interior so you will stay toast in the windy weathers.A+ Product, hell yeah."
2,Magnificent comedy,"Series one was pretty lame, series two got quite funny. Series three - it is awesome. It really is one of the best comedies I own, and I own A LOT.Being English, I had already come to love the original ""The Office"" which was a UK comedy that this American version is based on. When I started watching the American version I was hugely disappointed .... I thought it could never compete with the UK version which was hugely original and brilliantly put together. But then the US version went from being really not funny in Series 1 to very good in Series 2 and it just sky rocketed, IMHO, in Series 3. Every episode is a classic. I love it."
1,Too much like the last book,"I own all of K. Moning's books and this story almost parelled the last book she wrote. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the characters and the dialogue. But the story line is almost completly lifted from the last one. After reading this, I was very surprised by Ms. Moning comment that this was the hardest book she has ever written. I think for the future I will check out the library copy of any future books she might write."
1,Horrible unless you fit the stereotypes.,"I tried playing this with my girlfriend. Neither of us knows anything about sports, fishing, makeup, or fasion. Each card has three questions on it. You get to pick the one you think will stump your opponent. As almost every card had a question about one of the four above topics. We never moved anywhere. When we finally struggled our way to the wildcard line, we kept getting sent back to the start. We even tried switching decks so that we were each trying to answer questions geared supposedly towards our sex. We fared no better. It maybe better with a group of people, but we so fed up that with it that we weren't about to find out. Maybe some people who shop at the Salvation Army will have better luck."
2,"More of the same, plus","Pretty much the same as most guide books to birds of the southwest region, with some added and better locations given. Well layed-out, good photos."
1,Disappointed,"I really looked forward to receiving the waspinator. I have two paper waspinators but wanted a more realistic one, even though they did work. The disappointment is that the waspinator lasted only about ten days before the top of it started disintegrating. I've had the paper ones for three years and they are still fine. I can only surmise that it should not have been hanging where it was in the sun for several hours. I won't try another since the postage cost more than the item. If you do decide to buy any, be sure to hang it where it is completely sheltered from the sun. My next step will be to get out my sewing machine and make my own!"
1,Vanity organizer/tray,"If I had seen this product on the shelf, I wouldn't have bought it. It is too small for anything."
1,The African Queen,"We received the DVD in a timely manner, but when we went to watch the movie the disc was defective. It kept stopping and skipping. We were unable to watch the whole thing. I sent it back to the sender within a week after receiving it, but have not heard back regarding replacement or refund."
1,"Horrible coffee, annoying to clean","For this much money, one has a right to expect a decent cup of coffee. Unfortunately, because of a woefully inadequate grinding operation, what you get is a tepid, transparent, undrinkable cup of plastic-flavored water. If that is what you are looking for, then this ""coffee maker"" is for you. But beware, if you should actually want another pot, you will have to disassemble, wash, DRY, and reassemble - get this - 8 parts before you can use it again.Forget it. This is a complete waste of money at any price."
2,Great Bike,"This bike is light, and easy to ride. I feel like I'm flying when I ride it. Although it is a mountain bike, it also rides great on the street and sidewalks."
1,Not so good...,"This was a very dumb movie, I should have listened to the other ratings but figured I would give it a try.. oh well"
1,THIS IS STILL IN PRINT?,"HOW FAR DOWN CAN THEY GO? HOW ABOUT TITLES LIKE ""TOO MUCH BLOOD"" ""TIE YOU UP"" AND ""TOO TOUGH"". THE FACT IS ""THE WORLDS GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BAND"" GAVE UP CARING LONG AGO,FULL WELL KNOWING THAT THEY CAN RELEASE A ALBUM OF PURE BILGEWATER LIKE THIS AND SOME FANS WILL STILL RUN OUT AND BUY IT. FOLKS, THE GLORY DAYS ARE LONG GONE, THIS IS JUST ANOTHER CLUNKER TOO ADD TO THEIR POST 1973 LIST!"
1,Boring,"This book is so boring I'm barely getting through it but want to finish it in case the next book in the series is better. Kay is the BEST forensic pathologist, Lucy is the BEST whatever she is, Benton is the BEST profiler. Only Marino is still likeable to me. And I'm sick of the name Chandonne."
1,Surprised,"I was unpleasantly surprised by this book.Reading it before I saw the movie, I didn't like it.With a lack of dialogue, it seems that the the story moves slowly, not really going anywheree.One of the only things I did like about it was the subject matter, drawing readers in to something they see regularly in Washington. I wasn't happy with the lack of character interaction, there was definetly alot more telling by Buckley than showing, he needed to let the story just tell itself throught dialogue and character interaction.I was really expecting something better in this book."
1,Ear piece falls off,"The Jabra BT8010 advertised well, but as for performance... The over-the-ear loop falls off easily making it hard to keep it secured to the ear. You have to take the earpiece off and look at the display in order to use its calling features (which defeats the purpose of hands-free in a car). The controls for the music functions are unclear and unreliable. The earpiece advertises as being able to work with 2 devices, but it does not allow you to select which device to interact with. I was disappointed with it."
2,Love these pens.,"I use these pens in my classroom daily. They are fun colors and seems to last forever. They arrived quickly too, thanks."
2,Heartbreaking and lovely...,"I first encountered Amy Bloom's keen insight and matter-of-fact humanity in the pages of New Woman magazine, where she writes a monthly advice column called ""Sex/Life."" Upon discovering she had written a novel, I ordered it without hesitation. I was not disappointed. Love Invents Us is a startling and sensuous look at human relationships. Bloom shows us how every love affair (define that as you will) leaves its footprints on our personalities, with wonderful or disastrous results"
1,Monty Python's Meaning of Life,"Do not buy this DVD !! I bought the DVD on the first day and found that in every scene where there is movement, an obnoxious blur happens in the action along the edges of the actors, etc. Although I am a huge Monty Python fan, I was incredibly disappointed. I hope that there is a recall. If not, I'm going to return my copy because I consider unviewable...."
1,"Good if you plan on using it for one year, tops!","...because after two to three years, the rubber tubing connecting the dial to the cuff will completely dry out, harden, and crack...rendering everything other than the stethoscope garbage. Apparently, LifeSource used two different grades of tubing.It was used reliably for a few months then it was tucked away in my closet. Two years later, I looked in the bag and I was shocked to find multiple pieces of brittle tubing. Check out the photos that I uploaded."
1,Be careful,"This game can be fun, only if you have one of those top 3D machines and a brand new computer with everything on it. My computer, only 3 months old, didn't work with this game. It freezes very often, but from what I saw, if you have what it takes, it can be fun. Just make sure 1st."
1,Not a very good movie at all,"I absolutely love the left behind books, but this movie did them no justice. It was creepy and very weird. I don't know what else to expect from the company that made it, however. It is a very weird company."
2,this book was very good,the book titled above was excellent. It was suspenseful. The transition from the large firm to the streets was good also. the part about the little boy Ontario was very sad
1,Lord of the Rings Trilogy Blu Ray,Once again the studios are trying to double dip and sell you the basic versions of the movies when they have already released the extended editions on dvd. Yes the Movies are definately going to be better on Blu ray but i wll not buy this and i will wait until the extended editions become available and then i will only have to buy the trilogy once and get the far better version.
1,"Gave Sony a 2nd chance, still sucks","After years of problems with Sony home elctronics (and car audio) problems, I gave them another chance and bought this phone. Seemed pretty nice at first. Great screen and buttons. That's all it has going for it.Menus are incredibly slow, signal strength sucks, voice quality sucks. It tends to break apart when dropped (it happens). The screen is fantastic though..."
1,Very Heavily Scented,"If you are at all sensitive to fragrances, this product is not for you.I washed only one load of laundry in my brand new HE washer using Tide ""Original Scent"". Even though I used half of the recommended quantity of powder, the fragrance was so strong when I took the clothes out of the washer that I ended up washing the entire load two more times, without detergent, to reduce the smell. After the third washing, there was still enough scent left on the laundry that I could tell which towels had been in HE washer, and which ones were done in my old washer the day before using unscented liquid detergent.After doing some research on-line, I found Sear's fragrance-free HE powder. I have done several loads of laundry using it, and am happy with the results. It does a decent job cleaning the clothes, and they don't come out of the washer smelling like perfume."
1,I struggled my way thru this one,"I guess I only finished it becuase I always finish a book I start reading (especially if I paid for it).It was so hard to read, the style is tiring, resembling a ranting inner dialogue more than a book on an economic category, even iof it is from a cultural and anthropological perspective!At the end of the day I can say I know what Aztecs used for money (and how they tortured children to death as children's tears were considered some sort of ""rain magic"". damn, I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW THAT!!!) and that coins were invented by Lydians (and a number of simiral pieces of information) but I also have a HEADACHE and am feeling frustrated and nauseated and extremely unhappy.I don't think that is how you are supposed to feel after reading a book on history of money! I don't feel informed or enlightened at all.Having read other people's reviews I guess accuracy of information presented (unless it refers to social or cultural aspects of money) might also be problematic?!"
1,Not impressed,"The author makes many radical and unrealistic assumptions based on the Bible with not one reference or footnote, and no bibliography."
1,Barbaric..........,"This is the second disturbing book I have read by Coulter. Her novels seem to be riddled with abuse; both mental and physical.If you're looking for a fairytale romance or any romance at all skip this book. This book was about an Englishman who goes to the Carribean to investigate ghosts/spirits haunting his brother's property. That storyline flatlines and instead Coulter focuses on this odd, completely disturbed, man-hating young lady that is forced to wed the Englishman for her own protection. That sounds heroic, but trust me it's not.There is absolutely nothing in this novel that makes you want to keep reading further."
2,great classic mod release must have!,"this came across as sod part two but it was much more it took things to the next level,more aggressive,funny and deranged.this cd quality of mod cd you will never get again even gross missconduct will be better in talent but not in pure brutal riffage."
2,what's not to love,awesome from beginning to end. Does not need the heavy thinking that some movies try to come up with along the same line. Pure action and fun. Nice to see each actor explore the goofy side of their craft. You go in with little expectation and surprisingly walk away satisfied. Would recommend
2,This book work on many levels like the Kabbalah!,"This book is an amazing journey into the world of modern day Kabbalah. It feels real. The Seventh Telling, like the ideas of the Kabbalah, work on many levels. This book will open your eyes and hearts to something new. It's just a story, read it, enjoy it, be engrossed by it, and somehow magically grow from it's telling. Maybe it is not just a simple story?"
1,Does not work for me,"The overall effect is almost absent. It did not make things worse, and there might even be an improvement. Yet, if there is, it is so small that I cannot really see it after a month of use. I will have to go for some other product."
1,Film Shows Its Age,"This film shows its age in both a positive and negative way. Produced during the 70's, i.e. at the height of the Soviet occupation, it treads lightly while dealing with Poland's war-torn history. At one point a lead character explains that he is willing to accept Swedish rule temporarily in order to use their assistance against Poland's other ""enemies."" Since these enemies - Russians and Ukrainians - made up the bulk of the Soviet occupation forces, it is hardly surprising that they are not named. The acting in the film is overwrought, especially in the beginning. Making matters worse, the lead, Daniel Olbrychinski, is made-up like a silent film star. In an effort to impress the audience with the size of the Swedish army invading the country, the Director marches the same 40 or 50 extras past the camera about 10 times. (...) That said, this film is worth seeing (if not owning) if you're interested in Eastern European History circa the seventeenth century. (...)"
2,Please Move - Jonas Johansen,"This is a brilliant danish quartet, and their music ranges from traditional blues-rooted, improvisational jazz to more modern sounds. The band leader, Johansen, is the group's drummer. Together with his co-musicians on bass, piano, and tenor saxophone, and additional help on guitar and percussion, he experiments, putting each instrument in focus one by one, as well as swinging beautifully together. The saxophonist, Fredrik Lundin, is one of Denmark's most famous young jazz musicians. Both soulful and exciting!"
2,Wonderful!,"I had to read this book for the sake of an abnormal psychology course. Despite ultimately being forced to read this book, I really loved the nuance and obvious care in speech that Haddon has used in his work. It does take a bit of getting used to the way the narrator speaks - it's written in first-person, from the point-of-view of a young man with autism spectrum disorder - but it really turns out in a very caring, lovely way of writing. Please, do yourself a favor and read this great piece of literature."
1,Cliffhanger ending,"I've bought and read all of the books in this series. The story line is pretty good, but the author loves cliffhanger endings. I won't be buying any more in this series."
2,The Original Nanny McPhee....,"This was an entertaining collection of three small books. Except for some obviously English vs American language usage (e.g. treacle instead of syrup), the stories were lively and entertaining. My daughter loved reading them to me and we both benefited. I highly recommend this book."
1,"A little good, a lot of bad","The alien race was actually interesting, but could have been fleshed out more. Chekov was the high point: we get into his thoughts as head of security and as a leader. McCoy dukes it out with another doctor, which was entertaining.But McCoy also turns out to be afraid of water in a childhood flashback, then predictably gets trapped in a cabin filling up with water. That kind of stuff ruins a book for me. Long-lost relatives, ""incurable"" diseases, and previously-unknown phobias are the refuge of bad writers who can't see the rich characters right in front of them."
1,not what you think,ya know got it in may died in sep what can i say bad quality no durability just like most crap you buy these days oh and can only get partial refund of maybe 2 bucks and i pay for shipping so to the dump it go's.
1,Black House,"Ive read mixed reviews on this book and though i had to make my own mind up. I first bought the book, 120pages later i realised that i had no clue what was going on, so i bought the audiobook (5 hours later i was still thinking what the hell is going on).Now im stephen kings No1 fan and have loved the majority of his work, the talisman for me was a fantastic bolt on to the dark tower quest. So naturally i thought this would be the same.The book is one of the slowest drawn out books ive ever came accross, not a patch on previous work. I forced myself through the book expecting more, and im sorry to say this one doesnt deliver on any horror, excitment etc, do yourself a favour, get a tin of paint and watch it dry - more happens in that and at a much quicker pace than it does in this book.This book is for die hard fans only... but even diehards will find this a chore!"
2,A perfect blend of suspense and humor,"I was fortuntate enough to read a galley of this wonderful novel. If you liked Thr3e, you'll love Obsessed. Gone are the days when very basic, stale plots gave us yet one more book to waste our minds on. Dekker has a unique knack for combining plot elelments that make you laugh and think at the same time; give you chills and thrills back to back.Obsessed is the story of an Obsession that is born in a Nazi prison camp and finaly plays out in all of its glory in the mid seventies. I won't give away the plot except to say that the protagonist, Stephen Friedman, and the antagonist, Roth Braun, are both after the same invaluable relic. But as with all of Dekker's books, in the end it's so much more. It's edgy, maybe more so than PW would like good old fashioned Christian fiction to be. As for me, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the day that there are another ten authors who write books like this."
1,Why is this wipe so highly rated?!?,"I use and very much like the Seventh Generation diapers. I purchased these wipes today based on the favorable and high recommendations posted on amazon.com ... and, for the life of me, cannot understand why there are so many 5-star ratings!Yes, this non-chlorinated, low-toxin, environmentally-friendlier wipe earns points for being just that, but, for performance, this wipe feels and works like the equivalent of 3 squares of 1-ply toilet paper. I am willing to think that perhaps I bought a bunk package (I sure hope I did!) because the wipe is so, so small and seems really, really dry ... hard enough to use for clean-up of a wet diaper, I shudder to think how many wipes it would take -- and how messy the process would be -- to clean a bum that had a soiled diaper!I am headed out tomorrow to get something else."
2,book about Russia,"It is a good book: well written and honestly recorded. A bit subjective, as every personal opinion... and quite outdated in many ways, because life moves on, many features of Russian life are quite different nowadays."
2,Great Mirror !! Great Illumination!!,"I had owned a mirror for a couple of years just like this. Same style. Same Company, Jerdon. Well one day it just died. We would leave that thing on for hours at a time some nights. Lasted through many hours daily. So I decided to buy the same one again. It came in the mail and the only difference was the light switch. I used to have to hold mine down till the lights came on. The new one just goes on with one flip . That was great. The bad thing was it started blinking the first day. So Amazon sent me a new one. We have had the new one for some time now and it is great. The other one was a lemon. This one is perfect. I would never get a different one because the lights on this are very bright which i need when applying my eye makeup. My husband even uses it to cut his mustache!!! I would highly recommend this mirror, and would definitely by this brand again."
2,The best of '99!,"I made a review for St Valentines Day Massacre saying it was the best PPV of '99. That was before July 25 when I saw Fully Loaded '99! This tape IS Fully Loaded! 5 title matches are on the tape, nothing bigger than Austin vs. Undertaker End of an Era first blood match, where if Austin wins no more VinnyMac and if the Undertaker wins Austin never gets another WWF title shot! Buy this tape right away!"
2,Best album ever,"I love this album, i found it and bought it after listening to Celtic Invasion and Celtic Spirit. his other album is just as good. just a shame that they are too hard to find though."
1,Not very tasty,"I was really excited to try these as I like dried fruits. I know that they have great health benefits, but these don't taste very good at all. I thought they would be semi sweet and I would like to enjoy snacking on them. Unfortunately, I find them to be rather bitter and just not very good tasting. I will eat them because they are a healthy super food, but it's definitely something I would turn to when I have cravings for a tasty snack."
1,Doesn't suck...,"It's been a while since I used a gravel washer but I'm definitely not new to the hobby. The last product I used created a great deal of suction which I felt was necessary to really get all the excess debris near the bottom of the tank easily.Marina's Easy Clean didn't suck as much. I was disappointed as it didn't give me the same satisfaction of ""gravel washing."" Instead, it merely felt adequate as a siphon."
1,Poor color,the DVD color is very poor in comparison with the VHS version. It's watchable but only if you like the movie and the actors.
1,Disappointing 3d,We were really looking forward to this one after seeing the previews which made it seem as if it was going to be a winner. There was very little 3d at all. The plot was so so. Was mostly a let down
1,This Is a POORLY made toy,"1/24 RC 3-Ch Remote Control M1A2 Abrams TankThis tank does not work well at all.This was a gift for my eleven year old son. We were very disappointed.The tank remote is of the poorest quality and worked for only a few seconds before it completely stopped altogether. We tried charging and recharging to no avail.The cannon didn't shoot very far at all. The instructions were not very user friendly. More explanations in Chinese and very little english.We WILL NOT ever make any future purchases from this particular toy company again. Don't waste your money on this poor quality tank, it is not worth what is charged."
1,Insulting,"This book is an insult to people who do honest work in psychotherapy.This book is catered towards people who do not want to put the time and effort into changing their life. Life is difficult, yes but there are no easy answers. I would rate Dr. Covey as the second-worst author on the market (Next to Dr. Laura) for this reason - life is about the process, not about outcomes and by just focusing on what your want your life to be like wihout focusing on the work to get there, you'll never get there."
1,Junk,"Don't waist your money. Its junk. Find yourself a Military folding shovel, and I don't mean a ""Military type made in china"". It will serve you much better for much longer."
1,A complete waste of time,"Amateurish and juvenile. When not either of the two, the poetry was banal and pedestrian. Hopefully, with the right motivation, Catherine Wagner can use her talents where they would be appreciated and useful, such as writing greeting cards."
2,Wonderful overview of complex issues,"Barbour does a wonderful job in this book of explaining in layman's terms complex issues in both the fields of religion and science. He explores the overlap and conflict between different theories in each field and shows how the whole ""religion versus science"" issue is too simplified a summary of two such diverse fields. Barbour comes across as highly knowledgeable in both fields and not at all judgemental. A very good, informative read."
2,Boo Hoo,"Upon contacting Johnson & Johnson. yes America a huge corporation has destroyed the very best bar soap for us poor Americans with skin diseases. The balancing bar put together by Aveeno in Italy, has had their product Americanized. Now just oily bar soap or soap that you may as well buy any other brand name cheaper. But be sure to boycott Johnson & Johnson Products. They have pretty much made my life miserable. I have Pruregle Knodules, (however you spell it) and the word is suffer. Add in Psoriasis and bingo I have to find something else. Even the prescription meds I get for it all aren't as good as the Aveeno Balancing Bar. It has been discontinued. WAHHHHHHHHH."
1,Broken in less than 2 months,"This machine is attractive and the cost seems to be good. However, if you like to make daily espresso, this isn't he machine for you. After about 6 weeks of daily lattes, it stopped making steam. Even before that, it was a hassle to clean the multi-part, plastic steam nozzle. The knob for the steam valve is also too small - no leverage.Amazon doesn't handle returns of items that don't work. So while this machine may seem like a bargain, consider that it might only last a few weeks."
2,Pure delight,"I have been enchanted by this book. A newcomer to hockey, as both fan and player, I have been soaking up information and lore eagerly. This book satisfies both the urge to learn about hockey, and my wish to experience more of the true joy of the game. Taken out of the huge arenas with the expensive nachos and plentiful beer, there is a game that generations have loved to play and perfect. There are kids playing here, and adults, men and women. There are friends who help shovel the backyard rink, and those who show up later. And there are stories of other backyard rinks, of ponds, and of pros. If you like hockey, I don't see how you could go wrong with this book."
2,High performer,"Recently purchased as a replacement to an old Proscan DVD player. This unit doesn't seem to be loaded with features, but then I was shopping for quality, not features. Picture quality is excellent, as most DVD's are. Hooked up to a 41"" projection set (not HDTV) with Monster S video. Plays through smudges and scratches better than Proscan."
2,"Nick Twisp, you do surprise me","I confess I laughed as much from this book as from the first one. Frankly I'm mystified by the complaints of people who didn't like this one. Am I missing something? My friend who introduced me to Nick thinks some people expect a more realistic story. But with an author as imaginative as this guy, why would you want him to stick with realism. That's why I like Michael Connelly but he writes crime fiction. Reading Nick Twisp I'm just out for laughs. I look forward to more, since I hear there are two more books in the series to be published."
2,Love this Paci holder,"Really useful holder for pacifier, saves digging in purses and diaper bags! Easy to clean too."
1,VILLAGE IDIOT,"I can't help but think of all the people going into this film expecting to see a scary monster. The only scary monster is the hyped up advertising which seems to promise fear, scare, and psychological suspense beyond belief. More like boredom beyond compare. I've seen this story of an Amish-type society building a rural utopian dream only to be threatened by the same social element it ran from many times before, but never so massively produced and pretentiously executed as it is in this pseudo-intellectual, swath of artistic pomp. Your worst fears do come true here when absolutely nothing happens and the red herrings grow to the size of whales. And how does Adrien Brody manage to play a village idiot without any character whatsoever?"
2,Truely orgasmic!,"""Deviant Desires"" has brought sunshine to my otherwise dark existence. Great illustrations and graphic descriptions help me live out my wildest fanatsies. Truely orgasmic!"
1,Do not buy,"I am very unsatisfied with this lock. After about three months of use, the lock ""broke"", or became ineffective. It began to open when the combination was set to any number making it useless. I sent it in to get a new one per the lifetime warranty, and just received the replacement in the mail. This one does not work well, either. The digit in the thousandths place (the first of four number dials) is very difficult to turn. More importantly, I cannot even get the lock open after setting it the factory setting of 0005. So, both locks of this model have not worked.I had originally started buying Kryptonite in college, and thought they were a high quality brand. My opinion of their products has changed, and will no longer purchase their products in the future."
2,Good product but wrong outside dimension,"Can't complain about the product. It's an unfinished aluminum tube. The ends are rough so I'm guessing that means it was cut from a longer tube. The product I got was 1/8"" longer than 24"".My main problem with what I order was that the product name and the product specifications DO NOT MATCH. The name shows 3/8"" OD (outer diameter), however, the product specifications show 5/8"" outer diameter. So if you're looking for a 5/8"" outer diameter aluminum tube, this IS THE WRONG PRODUCT. I ended up having to reorder the Aluminum 2024-T3 Seamless Round Tubing, WW-T 700/3, 5/8"" OD, 0.555"" ID, 0.035"" Wall, 24"" Length. Note that the 2024-T3 is the finished aluminum tube. I couldn't find a 6061-T6 aluminum tube with a 0.035"" wall."
1,Classic Example of Why I'm afraid to spend money on Koontz,"Don't get me wrong, at times I love Koontz. I think Phantoms, Whispers, House of Thunder, and Intensity are among his best. BUT the other extreme are his characters that are super-perfect and overcome such odds that it left me rolling my eyes in exasperation. Also the ending greatly disapointed me. ""Was"" he or ""Wasn't"" he? There is no closure. Don't waste your time! Along with 'The Mask' one of Koontz's worst ever."
2,Durability and the MX Revolution,"A lot has been said about the excellent performance of this mouse. I enjoy using it, but want to add an interesting perspective.The other day I put on a pair of shorts I had taken out of the clean laundry. When I reached in the pocket, the USB dongle for the mouse was there...which means it had run through the washing machine and dryer. With great trepidation, I plugged it into my laptop and BINGO - worked perfect.So if you are the type who runs his computer equipment through the laundry, this mouse is for you."
1,Artic Tale DVD HD,"Just got the DVD today 8.23.2010. I have been waiting to see it. First tried to play the DVD on my computer, disk read error, then tried to play the DVD on Blue Ray DVD player disk read error again, then tried to play DVD on regular DVD player but disk still read error. Do not get to see Artic Tale,very upset about. I was expecting a very good quality picture because it's a DVD HD, turn out to be no picture at all.."
2,"Great Film, Can Bypass the Previews on DVD","This a must for all families! It does however have a few flaws in sound and the previews. They put the previews at the beginning of the DVD so you have to sit through them, once these previews start, you can not go straight to the menu. You instead have to forward through them. I have found a way to bypass the previews and go straight to the menu. If you turn on the DVD and before the licensing information starts, hit dvd menu and it will take you straight to the menu. (At least my Sony DVD player will) If you hit that menu button to late, though you're stuck or will have to turn the power off and try again. Otherwise, a great story that all ages will love. My 8 and 9 year olds have watched it 12 times already. Phil Collins does an excellent job on the music."
2,"Surprisingly worthwhile. Comfortable, compact","I ordered this whisk because most of the others i've had hurt my hands. I.e. they often had some sharp-ish edge near the end of the handle (sometimes a protrusion for hanging up) but even a slight shart edge can hurt when beating something hard. (another one without a sharp edge was an expensive silicone covered one, but the silicone prematurely started coming off the ""tines"") This whisk is fairly compact - it's not a huge balloon whisk, but it always does the job and doesn't take much room in the draw."
2,Like Nothing I've Ever Read,"I found it by accident when looking for a western to begin a couple hours before turning in one night. I'd been listening to Townes Van Zandt and wanted a novel full that kind of space and poetry. But it needed to be a western. It was available in ebook format from my local library and it immediately made my chest rise and fall and I could not sleep through the whole night. The next day I bought the physical copy to hold when finished. When I did finish, I read the last paragraph over and again. You don't review these books, you stand in wonder."
2,If you like the blues...then this is for you!,"Excellent mix of new and traditional blues artists. Makes me want to hit the smokey bar scene from my youth. Great listening, really brings back the memories. Definitely worth a listen and/or addition to your collection."
1,Not much of a surprise.,Who's Keyser Soze? Isn't it obvious? Not a very interesting movie. The characters are unlikeable. And the screenwriter obviously felt that inserting the maximum number of profanities would prove his 'hipness'. Repulsive flick!
1,Headache-Inducing,"I remember seeing the regular Pink Panther movies (with Peter Sellers in it). I remember them being funny. I don't know how Hollywood pulled this one off. It wasn't funny at all. It just seemed like everyone was trying too hard to be funny, and at times, it had its moments, but too few and far in between. And they've got the nerve to have a sequel? Ooookay, whatever.The only thing I liked about the disc was the video that Beyonce performed: ""A Woman Like Me."" After hearing the song itself, I listened to the commentary, and even the producers/directors said that she knows her voice (top-notch), but her acting...she still has a way to go. Either way, I still like the song."
1,All aerobic,"I was hoping this video would be different-it was all aerobic. I was looking for a workout tape similar to a Jackie Warner, P90X or Jullian style. This is not like that at all. If you're use to aerobics with women changing moves every 10 seconds, you'll love this."
1,Too abstract,"First, I have to confess that I had different expectations about this book (I thought it may be about other feelings too, but it's only about anger). The examples seemed poorly chosen for my 3-year old, who, for instance, does not really know what it means for somebody to make fun of him or why the teacher may unfairly berate him for talking in class. The idea of teaching kids that sometimes we cannot control the situation that angers us is good, but again, the example (I think one in which a favorite team loses a game) wasn't great. In general, the text was abstract and the illustration carried the burden of exemplifying what the text described...May be more appropriate for an older child."
2,Scariest techno I've ever heard,"Before hearing this album, I had no idea anything like the Hardcore/Gabber genre of techno existed. This album totally turned me on to it, although I've since discovered that most other gabber techno is utter crap. The steady pounding bass drum heard on this album gives the tracks a forceful insistence and manic energy not unlike 80's thrash metal in spirit, though completely different in feel and execution."
1,I need to re read it again,While she does have some incite into what is wrong with women. I do not think it all women who have done the wrong in relationships.... I hate the whole WOMEN fix yourself then a man will want you idea. And this feeds right into it. It seems to zap the power of the women to accept themselves alone. I would love to read one of these books written for men... that tell them that if they fix themselves then women will die for them. I would not suggest any women read this book. You are not single because there is something wrong with you but because you havent met the right man. Just that simple.
2,Bought for a gift,My sister realy enjoys cryptograms. So glad I could finfe a whole book of them.I will get her more when she finishes these
2,Very Useful.,"After several years of using the same laundry basket, traveling around the country, mine finally split apart and I had to get a new one. I took some time to look around and decided that the one that best fits my needs is this one. It's sturdy and durable. Also, with the handles on all four sides it is easy to carry. I've been using this basket for several months now and it has been just what I needed. Highly recommended for college students."
2,NEW ORLEANS' BEST SAX,"Lovers of late 50's New Orleans Rock'n Roll should include this classic in their collection. Lee Allen was the man that played Sax for Little Richard, Fats Domino, Smiley Lewis, Shirley And Lee and Huey ""Piano"" Smith. His great talents are shown in this fabulous mix featuring ""Walkin' with Mr. Lee"" and ""Tick-Tock""....It's a trip back to good time rock'n roll heaven....."
2,Good except for...,The tv is really good except its a problem getting all the sound through the tv to go to your surround sound.
1,Hmmm...,"I sincerely tried to enjoy and finish this book. Unfortunately, it could not hold my interest beyond the attempt to create a cohesive link between characters. Surely, someone might find the connection between characters intriguing, the locations within the great lakes a connection from the past worthy of a good read, but for me, this book was less than worth the time spent reading it.If you are familiar with the area, the special connotations of regional jobs and seasonal experiences, then this book is worthy of your time. As a NW Washington resident, I found this book to be a bore."
2,one of the best,I love Jimmy Stewart and this is the movie i love him in it. That and It's a wonderful life. I have been searching for it EVERYWHERE! I can't seem to find it and I love the movie. It's one of the best. I love mystery and it's a mystery!
1,Irresponsible,"Let me preface this by saying we haven't even read the book. We never even got that far. Why? Because after we got home and before my 7 year old son began reading, I just perused the book and realized the inappropriate language (referenced in other negative reviews here so I don't need to explain.) The back copy of my edition recommends the book for ages 7 and up. These are words my 7 year old has never even heard--nor has my 9 year old. I had heard good things about this series but we're done. Absolutely irresponsible and gratuitous. I'm appalled."
1,Pretentious and distasteful,"If you like name-dropping and looking down your nose at honest helpful people, you might like this book. The Goldstones seem pretentious and obnoxious. Too much of the book is filled with discusions of fashion and restaurants. I was hoping they'd talk more about books.The book is a disservice to book lovers. I wish someone would write a book about book collecting that was infused with a love of books, rather than this blather. Save your money. Buy books by Nicholas Basbanes and John Dunning and John Baxter and Robert Wilson and Paul Collins instead."
1,Who Done It?,"I found this book boring and repetitive, unlike Grisham's fictional works. Near the very beginning I concluded that DebbieCarter's killer was Glen Gore. Of course, my method of prosecution might not hold up in a formal courtroom procedure. If anyone other than John Grisham had submitted this manuscript for publication, it would have been rejected."
2,great!!!,"i loved this book, it was so great to hear from Logan's perspective!!! There was an unexpected ending, and very exciting too.copying off the back of the book is not considered a book review...."
2,this is an awesome piece of work!,"If you usually don't listen to rap, this album will be an exception. Go out and buy this! The lyrics are inspiring, and the beats are awesome. These guys really make you think. I praise God that there is a group like this out there."
2,Bob for Beginners,"This should be a good introduction to he of the grating voice and greater lyrics. Most of the major, timeless stuff is here that Dylan fans are familiar with. The beginner may find a revelation in the original versions of ""Mr. Tamborine Man,"" (which to me, has his most simple and profound harmonica work), ""Quinn The Eskimo,"" ""All Along the Watchtower,"" ""Knocking on Heaven's Door."" Take a listen to the best of the White Soul Brother of Curtis Mayfield and Bob Marley, then get the ""Freewheelin Bob Dylan""next."
2,My Comfort,I needed a new Security Box that was fire resistance. This is just what I was looking for. Great product. Thanks again.
2,In The Shadow of the Prophet.,This is a book all Americans should read. Know the enemy. This is a expose by a moderate Muslim of most of the terror organizations and their workings. It is also a good review of he history of Islam and it's glory days. A must read for all.
1,A surprising perspective,"I have absolutely no doubt that Greg Philo is totally sincere in his belief that his research came up with the conclusion that the media is biased in favour of IsraelI am equally sure that the findings are completely wrong!Totting up the number of minutes devoted to Israeli or Palestinian spokespeople does not amount to the words actually relating to support of the particular group you represent.To those of us who believe the bias is completely the other way, Greg Philo's findings come as a complete surprise and even a spokesperson for the BBC has questioned the veracity of the way the research has been interpreted.There are so many examples of anti Israel journalists and electronic media reporters, that it is truly hard to understand how this book has used the evidence availableJoy WolfeManchester UK"
2,Outstanding!,This product was easy to put together and works very well for storing all of my golf equipment. It is all in one place now and keeps it clean looking.
2,Fuga eDiary,"The eDiary is the greatest personal management tool I have used yet. I purchased the FUGA for its practical ease of use, simple interface, and price. After reviewing FUGA's web site extensively, comparing its functions to FUGA's competitors, I realized this PDA was the one for me. I am happy to say that this product is going to catch on quickly."
1,No Speaker Phone,"Cute phone, great concept with the radio and alarms, but this phone has no speaker phone option."
1,It stinks!,This thing is a total waste of time and money and i wouldnt suggest anyone waste their hard earned money on it.
2,Delicous mints,"These are delicious, chocolaty mints. We always keep a pack in the car to enjoy while driving. They have a really nice chocolate flavor, and I appreciate that they are sweetened with xylitol. They are small enough that they don't present a choking hazard; otherwise we rely on sugar free lifesavers which are artificially sweetened, don't contain xylitol and can leave a strange taste in your mouth. Anyone would enjoy these xylichew mints."
2,Ahhhhhhhhh crazybeautyhiphop4real,"If you consider yourself a hip-hop head who disavows association with the current media destruction of the worlds most beautiful art form, then you should not find yourself kickin it in your house, driving in your car, or whatever, without at the same time listening to this album. I don't like drum n bass very much, but Zion drops drum n bass HIPHOP while at the same time finding a common theme for it throughout the entire album. The beats are fresh, like nothing youve ever heard before, and they are guaranteed to keep you up all night. Don't hesitate to buy this. Don't have second thoughts. You will thank me."
1,Doesn't keep food hot!!!!,I bought this at either target or kmart. The food does not stay hot. I tried boiling my soup before putting it in the container...didn't work. I tried putting water in the container and microwaving for 10 minutes...did work either. Don't waste your money!!
2,Great service!,I received my item promptly and it was in the condition advertised. Great Service! Thanks!
2,ahead of its time,"I just read a copy of this 30s thriller and I was deeply impressed at how much more elegant and mature it is than most examples of the genre. It concerns a man whose son is killed in a hit and run, and he decides to find and murder the person responsible. The first half of the book, his discovery of the driver and plot to murder him, is superb. It reminds me of Patricia Highsmith, with its ambiguity of motive and its difficulty of determining guilt. The second half becomes more conventional, as a detective tries to sort out what happened and so on, but even that is good writing, except for the ending. If you're in a hurry, just read Parts 1 and 2 and pretend it's an exercise in open-ended thrillers."
2,not for me,this item was a gift for one of my kids and they love it. shipped fast and arrived early. price was right too.
1,Not up to par,"The finish is much darker than the other nickel items in my bathroom.It was difficult to get the screws started through the slots in the spring loaded bracket. The first screw went in a little way then stripped. I had difficulty removing it -- I had to use a pair of vice grips. Luckily I had a left over nickel screw from my shower installation. This one started easily and tightened ok. I should have learned from the first screw. The second screw (provided with the unit) finally started, but stripped when it was ALMOST tight. There wasn't enough of the screw exposed to get it out, so there is a small gap between the fixture and wall on that side."
2,"Truth often requires heavy research to awaken us, but this book is a true gem!","This book is wonderful. The mass medication that the Governments endure on us is quite shocking. Any way to make money and push our health over the edge shows that they have no compassion on humanity. This book is highly recommended. Those who find it difficult to believe the claims as to why our Government would want to poison us and promote such a product, please understand that we are always told lies from our Governments and health industries. Fluoride is just one of the many hundreds of problems we must work through. The skincare industry is self-regulated and even shampoos, deodorants, and moisturisers contain harsh cancer causing chemicals.Get a Whiff of This: Perfumes (fragrances) -- the Invisible Chemical Poisons"
1,expensive and still loaded with typos and other errors,"This book proves that a good publisher makes a difference, and that prentice hall does not qualify. I've never seen a computer book that contains so many errors. Combined with the hideous layout of the goldfarb series, this should be enough to keep you far away from it. BTW: i've added a second star, because valuable stuff is hidden in it; you just have to work too hard to get there.If you're new to python, buy learning python and programming python instead. if you want to apply xml with python, use the web to learn more. Only buy this book if it's *deeply* discounted, or if you're looking for job as a book editor. Otherwise, you'll end up rewarding incompetent publishing."
1,"Pretty good, but could have been a little less boring","This book was an interesting approach to the life of Thomas Jefferson by looking at his character rather than an entire life history with unnecessary details. I did not really enjoy the context though, because it was slow and at parts hard to understand."
1,Worked five times then died.,"This mower worked well, cord is awful, wont stay in mower well......but it only worked 5 times on a very small lawn. It died, but Amazon understood my plight and refunded my purchase price. Amazon is fantastic in regards to customer service. I purchased a fiskar reel mower and love it. nothing to break"
1,DISAPPOINTING!!!!,"I was sooooo....eager to start on this diet despite the fact that I am not a fruit eater. The diet is essentially a healthy one but not something that the average non-fruit eater could stick with. I purchased the book and read it from cover to cover in one sitting and immediately started the next day. For several days I made fruit smoothies for breakfasts and I tried a lot of different variations but I just could not even make myself like them. Although the author constantly says throughout the book that the diet is not a fruit diet, I beg to differ. Let's do lunch is a FRUIT DIET!!! If you do not like fruit you will not be successful with this plan. I had several questions that I needed clarity on and I emailed the author via the website and he never even responded to my email. Don't waste your money on this book and don't bother to try this diet if you don't like fruit!!!"
1,Too self involved,"I found the main observations in this book fairly interestering. But overall I found his attitude to the locals fairly arrongant unless they happened to help his journey. If you read the book them you will otice a few pieces of information don't check out e.g. the first cane bridge that he walks on and falls through he describes the pieces of wood being 30 cm apart, however in the picture in the book you can clearly see in the photos taken by himself that the only space close to that is the hole he fell done the rest were closer to 10 cm. To be honest this book has stirred an interest in this genre but I will be looking for books by a open minded writer, unlike Mark Shand."
2,Rush owns live albums,"This is the first of many incredible live albums by Rush circa 1976. I had this one on cassette back in the day, wore that thing out! A great live version of 2112 on this one, plus Something for Nothing and a Working Man/Finding my Way melody that is out of sight."
1,lame,"crystal method are a joke. missing the point of electronic music completely and creating repetitive unoriginal tracks. no wonder they became so popular, just another reason nobody respects electronic music. people keep making acts like this famous."
1,TERRIBLE movie with cool makeup/costumes.,"I was really excited about seeing this movie. I rented it to see if I should take the plunge and buy it. In general the story and set was good. However by the end of the movie the plot had plunged into the depths of ridiculous unbelievable stupidity. By trying to leave himself open for a sequel, Tim Burton created a VERY DISAPPOINTING and UNEXPLAINED ENDING. I am so glad I didn't buy this movie or waste the (...) in the theater to see it. If you liked the series, it would be okay to rent, but DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM!!!"
2,Addictive as nicotene,"Martin really has world and character building down. I hope I don't lose my wife and job -- I haven't had this hard of a time putting down a book since this one's predecessor and Ken Follet's ""The Pillars of the Earth"" (highly recommended). A bit slower in the middle than Game of Thrones, the finale in this one fully makes up for it. Cliffhangers, betrayals, mysteries, and adventures abound. I was beginning to think that all the battles would be seen from viewpoints that weren't from characters in the middle of it, but this book does not disappoint.While reading this, I was thinking these books were too long for a movie, and would make a great HBO series. As if the seven gods were hearing my prayers, I listened to a FREE eyeToonz interview with Martin where he mentioned that an HBO series is actually in the works. Hang in there, true believers! I sure hope it happens...these stories are too awesome not to be filmed, and too gruesome for cable."
1,Richard O'Kane is a great hero,Richard O'Kane is a great hero! The writer often confuse the issue with all the other stories. The book size could have been reduced 1/2 - if writer would have been writing about Richard O'Kane and not everything else. This made the book boring.
2,Marcus Miller: Master of All Trades,I'm a huge Marcus Miller fan so take it with a grain of salt but this is an outstanding performance. The Audio quality is better than the earlier concert CD. Plus since the promoters and halfwits at the radio stations here in Chicago always trot out the same tired acts its nice to imagine I'm at a Marcus Miller show.
2,Totally laughable and enjoyable,"This is one of those movies that is SO bad it is actually good. The section that I like the most is the part where the hand is put into a microwave and taps on the glass. That entire section of the movie is one where you will laugh out loud. Also, who can resist a Summer Glau movie?"
1,Not for big leakers,"I like that this is reusable, comfortable, affordable, and doesn't show through clothing. HOWEVER it shifts and (more importantly) it doesn't take much to soak through these. They need to be water proof on one side or something! but they're not. Hope to find something better, went back to disposable."
2,a love for great new music,"I received the latest Garbage cd for my birthday titled Beautiful Garbage.. I have listened to it over and over again. This cd just mixes a lot of different beats in each song. I felt each song also has a different feel, meaning to it. My moods would go well with certain songs.... Shirley definitely did a good job on this album. I like their different styles on this album. She just overall has a good voice, but garbage is definitely something you would want to have. A must.. because it's so unique and just great..."
1,horrible cheap and cr*ppy,My friend just got a double eagle m83 and he wanted to test it out on the goggles from point blank. I let him and the goggles shattered. even the outside part that holds the lens cracked the D.E m83 is only 200fps.
2,"series is good, but the DVD lacks for one reason","The dvd lacks due to the fact that the pilot on the dvd is not the originally FIRST aired pilot, but is the original pilot that was shot first(they shot the pilot on the dvd first, and fox told them to reshoot, and the reshot version was what aired--that is the better version in my opinion)--personally I would have enjoyed the dvd containing both pilots, but what can you do."
1,Disappointed,"Oak finish is beyond ""distressed."" It appears to have been made with damaged wood. Obvious nail holes in a 4 square pattern is not distressed, it's used in my opinion. There are also chips and scratches that are not stained. All of this on the face of the product. Would not recommend this unless you plan to place it inside a closet, or in an area that is not in plain sight."
2,"Great martini drinking, entertaining music, loved it","This is a great cd to throw in when you are entertaining guests prior to a dinner party. I loved it and Poe's version of A Rose Is A Rose was a big hit. If you are at all interested in lounge music, this is a must buy!"
2,Anastasia,"This DVD was exactly wonderful as described in other reviews. So glad I went with Amazon as the price was incredible compared to video stores in the mall. Shipped quickly, too."
2,KITCHEN AID 5-QUART MIXER,BEST QUALITY. GREAT VESATILITY AND ENOUGH POWER TO KNEAD BREAD WITHOUT BOGGING DOWN. A LIFETIME APPLIANCE. GIFT PURCHASE. OUR PERSONAL KITCHEN AID IS 15 YEARS OLD. WORKS LIKE DAY 1.
1,Big mistake,"The product description was 3x but when received the size was ""one size"". The top would fit a 12 year old without a chest. The G string was bigger than the top. Greatly disappointed and would not buy from this line ever again."
2,"5 stars for a garage door accessory, maybe i'm pushing it",A simple product that does exactly what it is suppose to do. Easy to install. Just make sure to check the placement once the glue is down and the door is closed. This will ensure if the threshold moves you still have time to fix.No more rain water in the garage after 3 big storms. gotta love it
2,Jeuses this is a great album,My first Beck album. Lovely hard guitar work. I now have to get all the other albums. For anyone who likes to hear a real musician this is it.
2,Cured baby's eczema,"After trying a multitude of products to help clear up my newborn's eczema without any luck, I finally came across this and it worked - my baby's eczema cleared up almost immediately. This is a holy grail of baby products for me."
1,Sexist Hatchet Job,"This is a poignant story about an old lady who used to be somebody and is now losing her faculties. It's touching, but it is not what the viewer needs to know about Prime Minister Thatcher - one of the most powerful and important women of the twentieth century. If you want a feminist role model for your daughter, try renting a documentary instead.Imagine if Hollywood made a movie about Ronald Reagan that focused on the senile dementia of his twilight years. The producers are obviously political enemies, indulging in a cheap attack now that Lady Thatcher can no longer defend herself."
2,Textbook,"This textbook arrived quickly as I signed up for student speed, so to say. It was in good shape and packed very well."
2,so many things were done very well in this film,Top notch film making here. Pitch perfect casting. Excellent effects. awesome soundmixing and effective use of soundtrack. Get it. Watch it. Enjoy!
2,Scary Movie the most funny movie this year,Where are you going to get a good cast like so or some funny scenes I The red evening gown spoof or the fire hydrant spoof I think it was all out good!
2,Fantastic,"It ships quickly, and the casing is always amazing. And for a great price. WILL be buying as soon as I run out again!"
2,Mathematics is fun and a real thriller,"I really enjoyed this little book. It is an excellent survey of number theory and the history of mathematics. It's truely easy to read, full of suspense and mathemetical riddles. But it's not only about numbers and science; it's about the people that do mathematics. Therefore it is a science thriller containing passion, tragedy, genius and success."
2,Works immediately!,"I received a sample of this product and was amazed by how well it worked immediately! I have very dry skin and largish pores around my nose and lines under my eyes - both problems were erased by this cream. My face was glowing and beautiful like I had lost 10 years of aging. This is truly a miracle because nothing else has been helping me and the whole aging thing was really depressing me. My boyfriend couldn't get over how lovely I looked and asked me: ""what did you do?! You look so beautiful!"" I am purchasing some of this right away and maybe the night cream, too. I also take hyaluronic acid tablets (I had stopped for awhile because they can be expensive and that is when I noticed some dramatic aging - started again recently). Taking HA internally also helps your skin and really helps me sleep well at night for some reason and helps with joint pain and stiffness. It is a wonderous element that I am happy to re-discover!"
2,Fair Mini-Biography of Nietzsche,"I bought this book because I wanted a brief biographical overview of Nietzsche. To this extent, the book was very pleasing. The large type and low number pages made it a very quick read (less than 90 minutes). It was worth purchasing (to me) for these pointsA portion of the book is dedicated to a brief synopsis of Nietzsche's philosophy. I found this to be useless. I don't feel the coverage in this area was unbiased. There are a lot of points where the author offers his own opinions which are typically contradictory to Nietzsche. Having an opinion is fine but it doesn't belong in an overview text.With all of this, it was worth reading for the mini-biography. Certainly, this won't be the only book you will need to read on Nietzsche if you are interested in learning about him. Aside from Nietzsche's own works Walter Kaufmann is a good area to start."
1,didnt live up to the hype,"After searching endlessly for a conan book that lived up to R.E.H. or De Camp and Carter, I thought after reading the reviews on this book this one would do it...WRONG. I dont know how this book got the rating it has. The writing is fine but Conan is not the same from the original books ( like most other reviews say ). In the first couple chapters he gets physically bested...twice! And it keeps getting worse, and more BORING from there. If you want Conan stick to the original 12 volumes those are the only true Conan novels."
1,Worthless...,"This is probably one of the worst pieces of writing ever. She outlines her so called beliefs, which are based on nothing. Her expierances definitely had an influence on forming her opinions on men, which lead to her ideas of hate and violence. There is absoultely no substance to her. Obviously, she is a woman with a weak mind that was never able to over come the way her life turned out. She is a wanna-be star that never made anything of herself in life. Her envy of Andy was the reason she shot him. She probably assumed shooting Andy Warhol would bring her some fame. She wanted someone to blame for her complete failures in life so she choose men to blame. I believe in reading everyones view and trying to understand where they are coming from, but this woman was obviously unstable."
1,"trash, fake, can't rap, u guys are idiots for buying into this","This sh*t is corny. I don't see how 4 million people bought into this guy. You can't see whats going on here? I seen these guys in Harlem. I almost pulled out my gun and started Easy vs. West Pt. 2. I'm sure they had guns on them so I decided not to shoot. Next time though, I'm gonna murk one of these dudes when I see them. Phony dudes, phony music. G-Unit is ok, but this dude is trash. fake."
2,Not a horror flick but...,"I bought this because I loved Bill Zebub's ""Night of the Pumpkin"" killer pumpkinhead movie. Bad packaging on this one so I was mad at first but then I started laughing at the dialogue and situations and by the end of it I had to say it's a pretty good movie. I loved the actors, all of them. It's not Hollywood. It's an indie, a really, really low budget indie, but it's much better than these other reviewers rate it."
1,THIS IS NOT VOLUME 2!,This is not part of the What's New Scooby Doo Volume set. It shows Volume 2 on the picture and clearly shows that 4 episodes are on the DVD ... but it is actually only 2 episodes from that volume ... NOT the full volume as pictured. I ordered it and got the wrong one .. sent it back and they sent me the same thing a second time. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Amazon ... but I was really frustrated that I couldn't actually get a PERSON to understand my problem. I just kept getting these emails back from someone who obviously didn't read my email or understand what was going on ... maybe it was automated .. who knows! I finally just gave up and found it at Walgreen's for $5.99. Bottom line ... don't order this if you want Volume 2!
2,Great Book,This book is filled with historical information as well as current information for Catholics. I am going to try to get one every year.
1,LOOK WITH BOTH EYES,"I purchased these at about the same time I purchased a set of willow baskets and the difference was stunning. These are rough, pieces break easily, they scrape furniture and are very cheap looking. I would not purchase them again. The willow baskets are so much better."
2,Brillant,Stewardship in it's purest form. Benioff does a wonderful job laying the foundation for a business of any size to get involved and develop a philanthropic spirit within the spirit de corps.
2,A very entertaining film,"While ""The Saint"" isn't precisely an epic film that everyone should see, but it's really fun and keeps my attention and interest each time I watch it. Val Kilmer displays his innate gift for accents and for a chameleon-like ability to change his personality traits. Elisabeth Shue, of whom I've never been fond, is also enjoyable in her role, largely due to her brimming and infectious enthusiasm for her work. This isn't a Must-See Movie, but it's sure to be enjoyable for anyone who likes action movies."
2,good quality for the price,nice flag to honor those who served. cheaper that buying else where. made a great gift idea for my father.
2,An exciting Science Thriller,"An exciting Crichton-like thriller. Many twists and turns. Are the good guys really good? Quick moving story with many twists and turns. Action packed, I couldn't put the book down to see what Erlick would come up with next. Never lacked for a suprise twist. Well researched...this could really happen."
2,Hours of fun,Cheap toy for a big amount I fun couldn't stop laughing was bigger than I thought made a really good birthday present for someone who I had no idea what to but for him
1,Admin Assistant,"the description for the filter I feel was a bit misleading. No where does it mention that this reusable filter can ""only"" be used with single cup home machines except of course that the picture on the box mentions single cup. I think the company should be much clearer in their wording. As far as the product goes, I wasted the money because I am now using the filter in the box as a paper weight in the reception area of our office because we simply can't use it. Great job! at least I was able to put it to some creative use. The cost of returning it is not worth the hassle and would mean I paid for something twice that I'm not able to use."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY YOU SAVE IN SHIPPING!!,We bought this water cooler about 3 months ago and now are running into the same problems the previous reviewers had. The cold water is now HOT and the taste of the water itself is TERRIBLE. The fan has broken and we are replacing it with a leftover computer fan until we can get a new cooler.We are an employer and have about 60+ employees. We are unable to keep the water cool enough and it really does not hold up well to the amount of people who want to use it. We are actively searching for a better model at this time. Save your money and put it towards the shipping charge of a higher-end model.
1,don't get it!,i had it it lated awile(1-2months)enough to last till it wouldn't open! other things happened i didn't likeDON'T GET IT PEASE IT'S A WASTE!!!!
2,DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH,Nice little movie I wasn't aware of. Very good performance from Mackie Washington and Pierce. One of those rare pleasant movie surprises.
2,Simply Amazing,"For a relaxing afternoon, rainy day, or just chillin, this cd is great. There's a good mixture of music, from moving your feet, to cuddling with someone special. I love it."
2,Works perfectly,"This mirror is cute and the quality of reflection is great, not distorted like some baby-safe mirrors. I can see my baby perfectly!"
2,Plink,Catches bullets like a Philadelphia cop. I use it with subsonic ammo in the basementas well as hotter loads out doors.
1,"HATE IT,DO NOT BUY THIS","DONT BUY THIS, THE DIRT COMES ALL OUT, STOPS WORKING AFTER WEEKS... HORRIBLE, NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!"
2,Informative,William Cooper did an outstand job in writing this book. He has a wealth of knowledge that will assist the reader in researching other books that supports his claims.
2,"Another ""Sparkling Gem""","R. C. Howe, February 19, 2004,Nicholas Sparks' 'The Wedding'--his eighth novel of human emotions--is arguably his best to date. We look forward to #9!"
1,Whew! What a switch!,"Wow. Just when I finished a few good reads, I wind up with this lousy mess! I am one of the thousands who absolutely enjoyed SECRET LIFE OF BEES--though it was a bit silly, you couldn't help but like all those gals and really, just about every thing about that charming little story. I was sure that others might have been a bit too harsh on Sue Kidd and her latest work--but boy oh boy,,,this is indeed, a let-down. So wish it were not so, though. In sum? Skip it and pick up: THE MEMORY OF RUNNING instead."
1,Dreadful!,This book is published by a vanity publisher for good reason. No commercial publisher would EVER put this thing into mass circulation.
1,Defective product,"Shipment was neither fast or slow. Product package seemed to be of decient quality with UPC and labels. Did arrived with shrink wrap. Discs inside appeared to look professionally made with one exception, near the center hole it looked as if the inter reflective layer had bubbled and pulled away from the plastic disc. This software would not auto-run when inserted into my laptop. After 3 or 4 attempts it finally began to load and then it paused.After finally being able to load the software I tried to update it from Adobe's website and I was not able to. I called Adobe to try to register it over the phone and was told it could NOT BE REGISTERED.You decide why Adobe could not register it......Seller did refund the full purchase price.I then ran a full system scan on my computer to check for viruses and malware.Remember, you ALWAYS GET what you pay for."
1,much ado about nothing.,"I love those 3 stars. Wow, what a cast.All they needed was a plot. My wife and I watched loyally for almost an hour, waiting for some substance or anything actually funny. It never happened. We walked out (turned it off).Perhaps films like this had more cultural context in their own time. But I am old enough to appreciate value in a classic setting. I just didn't see it.Very disappointed...not serious and not funny. I couldn't have cared less about those characters, beautiful though the stars certainly were. All 3 of them were badly miscast in those fluff roles."
2,Don't Look at Any Other DVDs,"UPDATE: I have purchased approximately 250 more of these DVDs, and so far, there have been no bad DVDs.I have bought DVDs online over 10+ times and from many sites. I can say without any doubt that these are the best DVDs I have ever worked with. There are no bad DVDs and they work great for burning on your computer or a duplicator. The white printable surface is solid across the hub, which is a rarity. Packaging was excellent and arrived on time. Will buy again and I suggest you do too. There's a reason there are only 5 star reviews."
2,Different,"This cd was alot different than waiter. The first track is the next eight put together. Long ambiant phases between dark synth driven songs, much more digital than the pervious album. his vice is possibly better in this cd, definatly worth the ep price"
2,A good breakfeast cereal,"Product is a good breakfast cereal and it did increase my blood iron some what, but a little bit too expensive to make it worth while."
1,"They suck, and they hurt","I'm not an audiophile, and even I can tell this is bad. I played Radiohead with my ipod and it sounded like a tin can. Also, these things hurt your ears. I get a headache everytime I put them in. Without listening to music it hurts regardless. My ears are not mishaped in any way. This is just a poor product. For cheap earphones that have good quality, get the Coby's."
2,Preconceived,"I think this is a great book, however, it has alot of unanswered questions (as far as I'm concerned). Some parts I think could've been more detailed, especially the issue with her sister and the situation she was dealing with.Oh...the first love scene with you no who if you read the book was great. I was laughing and wishing, saying to myself DAMN.... Wishing it was me....Over-all it's a great book...Robyn Williams has excellent writing skills."
1,The worst customer service ever,"I recently was going to purchase an orbit10106 5 pack.I noticed I needed more than 5 and was going to order two 5 packs.I noticed the shipping charge was $4.99 for one 5 pack. When I tried to order 2 the shipping chargewas $9.98 even though the weight of the total wouldnt have changed the shipping costs. So I sent them an e-mail andthey never mentioned anything about the shipping . All they sent back was a Rude e-mail that basically if you dontlike it find it cheaper somewhere else.If you cant trust them to send back a cordial e-mail how can you trust them if the product is defective !!!Granted the cost of the product was fairly cheap but, if you add the shipping costs you can find it cheaper elsewhere."
1,Don't bother watching this... a waste of time,"This is probably the biggest waste of time, I ever spend watching a video. This is not a 'Spingbeak' flick, or a story or any kind of acting or even a documentary, it is simply a NOTHING! Don't waste your time or money on it!"
2,My Husband Loves It!,"So far my husband has loved this Tree Stand. Is it well built and not too expensive. There are a few minor reasons I did not give a full five stars.1) It is a little heavy. However, it isn't too bad and it is a tree stand.2) The harness that coms with it was basically crap. My husband already had one though.3) The seat looks comfortable in the picture but when it arrived it was escentially a piece of plywood with a this foam layer around it. While it is a litte harder than it looks it still isn't horable."
2,Good Show.,Very entertaining show. Always keeps you guessing about what is gonna happen next. Great character development. Can't wait till next season.
2,"Very cool and ""enlightening"" toy","Another character that the little boy from Ben-10 can change into, this larger action figure is very nice indeed. It converts into a flashlight which, again, allows for more play time (my kids wished that it did that and glowed int the dark as well but that's wishful thinking). It's sturdy and well made. I'd suggest also picking up more than one if you have more than one kid because they'll end up fighting over it otherwise."
2,Worth the Money,"I love it! It was extremely intuitive. Easy to use, lots of features, voice/speaker feature is great."
2,Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers,"So far this book is very interesting. It gives a whole new meaning to death/cadavers. Our history is very morbid in our search to know how the human bodies work. Reading this book is a great way to be thankful for those who endeavers the medical world to what it is today. Kinda of creepy, but a great read."
1,(Two-and-a-half out of four) Another Artsy Webb Wilder timekiller until his next LP came out,"As much as I like Webb's various 'Hillbilly'Detective genre type stuff, this was justtoo artsy-fartsy for me to get all the waythrough. Webb is pretty good (and sometimesprofane) in these type things, so I recom-mend the funny and bold Webb Wilder's CornFlicks to this by a good bit. There are noother 'known people' in here which makesthis West Texas murder mystery-detectiveflick that much more difficult to take. Itis well filmed and edited though."
2,Unfreakinreal!!!!!!!!,"BUY IT NOW, caught them on ITUNES and was blown away. Check them out you will not be disappointed."
2,Indiana Hidden Treasure,"I remember this guy from my childhood. we sort of grew up together. I bought the book for that reason, but after reading it I have to say even if you don't share any childhood memories with Joshua Bell, you should buy this book. it's worth it."
1,New Format,"Newsweek recently implemented a ""New Format"" with very small font sizes. It is very difficult to read without using a magnifying glass. The ""NEW STYLE"" is very poor. I have cancelled my five year subscription and will try ""Time"" magazine. Certainly do not recommend the newNewsweekNewsweek for any age or profession."
1,good product,"I purchased this ""pillow"" for my husband. He sleeps with a regular pillow between his knees. I thought he would really take to this for the comfort, but I think he slept with it only once. It lays by his side of the bed and I'm thinking of selling it. The product is great. It's everything it claims to be; unfortunately, my husband didn't seem to care for it."
2,"Super course, but a dead-end","I'm an American woman, married to an Italian. Although we live in the U.S., we are trying to raise our daughter to be fluent in Italian. This course is probably the best one that I have seen for kids.Here's the problem: once you have finished this course, there seems to be nothing more (no volume/course II). I guess this can still be useful if you wish to get your child excited about studying Italian. However, if you are both serious about learning, you soon will have to switch to another system (or move to Italy).For long-term Italian study we are using the Rosetta Stone DVD course."
2,Awesome CD!!!,This cd is so Great! I am very happy I bought it! I can listen to it over and over and never get tired of the music! Awesome soundtrack to go with an awesome film!
1,Stiff and not true to size,This is a very stiff shoe. I ordered the size to match a size 7 US. It was cut very small.
1,Worst Movie....Ever?,"As an avid Sex and the City fan I feel obligated to inform the masses that this is by far and away one of the worst movies of all time. The series was clever and funny, and the first movie carried this trend to our general amusement. The second movie was an unnecessary travesty. If you want to watch the complete degradation of all characters we've come to know and love, all the while disgracing themselves and a foreign culture along the way by all means please watch this tragedy of a film. All involved should be disgraced by their association with this film, and the director, producer and writers should be banished from making additional cinematic failures so as to spare us all from spiritual decline."
1,An Unscientific Polemic,"This book is based on anecdotal evidence, and ignores completely the scientific evidence that traumatic events can be forgotten, only to be remembered years later.The author is a founding member of the ""False Memory Syndrome Foundation"". There is no scientific evidence whatsoever for ""false memory syndrome""... in fact, there is not even a scientific *definition* of this ""syndrome"".Please balance your reading with scientific literature on memory and abuse, such as those by Kenneth S. Pope or Jennifer Freyd."
2,Super cute,"My grandkids just love this one. They have to watch it over and over.The 2 year old laughs, claps her hands and is totally engaged. The 4 year old sings along with animation. This video is truly fun and educational.I highly recommend this for all preschooler."
2,Includes Madonna's Hit Song!,"""I'll Remember"" is the one tune that makes this whole soundtrack. Her strong vocals over a clean melody, backed by a deep, slow bassline make this ballad worth listening to. For an ambient dance remix by William Orbit, check out the ""I'll Remember"" maxi-single. The track is also included on her 1995 ""Something To Remember"" album."
1,Old stock Kodak battery,This is an original Kodak battery and who knows how old. It would not take a charge and I returned it for credit.
2,"""I'm Beverly Boyer--and I'm a pig...""","Very witty and clever comedy has ordinary housewife Doris Day(who's married to a doctor and lives in a suburban sprawl with two charming kids and a maid)getting on TV and almost by accident becoming an overnight sensation. Aside from a little dated sexism at the finale, and a sour sequence with James Garner pretending to be drunk, this is a very smooth and capable farce. The child actors are terrific, and gorgeous Doris Day having a kanipshin fit is worth the price alone."
1,Pretty to look at but boring once you get to know it....,"Visually, a very appealing game indeed. Trouble is, there's this pesky linear aspect to it. As with many games like these, one starts to feel like one is a geriatric being wheeled about from one zoo exhibit to the next.Long and the short of it. If you like games for their playability this one falls short IMHO. I guess I'll just have to stick with good old Battlefield 2 as it seems to be the only serious FPS."
1,Unreadable tripe about riduculous macho woman,"OK - my biases up front - I am starting to avoid novels by female authors, despite being a liberal and 50 years of supporting female equality, etc. This book drives the problem home with a stake through the heart.Forget about hokey plot elements. Ignore the apparent good guy mercenary network. Etc. Focus simply on the main character, a woman doctor with a sick child. I HATE HER! She over-protects her son (if she keeps at it he stands no chance of ever growing up), her guilt is idiotic, and on every page she tries to prove that she is tougher and a better killer than two huge trained mercenaries.ARGH! This would be ridiculous if it was a guy, it flies in the face of the profession (researching doctor), it's is completely opposite the qualities needed by a single parent, and on and on. Is the author so totally clueless about ""being macho""?Do not waste your time. There are thousands of better books."
2,Good tent,"I love the tent.I use it in the tropical rainforest and it is important that the tent is as well ventilated as possible.I like the 8 ft model because its not too high. This makes the tent more stable in windy conditions then his 9ft brother.The tent hold up well in rainy conditions.The thing I like most is that when using a normal coleman air matress your sleeping height is level with the screens on the side. This makes the tent very cool, even in hot climates.The only possible improvements I can imagine are:Even more screenHooks to attach the tent to the poles instead of sleeves, which are always a bit of a hassle setting up as well as taking the tent down.The tent is roomy enough for 3 adults or 2 adults and 2 small children.I would recomend the tent, especially for warm climates."
2,Everyone needs one in their hangar,This is the best trainer on the market. The best part is you will continue to fly it for years. It is that much fun to fly.
2,baby boy christening gift set,all i can say is this was great gift and the price was great for what you get
2,Daughtry Rocks!,Excellent CD. Well worth the money! He is extremely talented and every song on this CD is enjoyable. I highly recommend it.
2,Wish I'd ordered two!,I bought these for my classroom but my 16 month old daughter immediately claimed this puzzle for her own!! She loves it!!! It is sturdy and amazingly not as annoying as some toys that talk! Very educational!
1,"Good movie,terrible transfer to DVD","Being a George O'Brien fan l immediately jumped at the chance of buying this DVD.Unfortunately the quality (sound and picture)are terrible.There is so much damage done to this copy,that attimes it is difficult to understand what the actors are saying.I will never buy a DVD from this company again.Don't waste your money."
2,Provided what was promised,"Package arrived and had to be signed for, although no tracking information had been provided. DVD was in stated excellent shape and included a print out page of how to safely clean DVDs."
2,"Not a Vornado, but gets the job done","This fan is neither as powerful nor as quiet as the Vornado fan it tries to imitate, but compared to some of the other fans on the market today, the Honeywell Mega Turbo is pretty darn good. It moves an impressive amount of air, is solidly constructed, and comes with a reassuring 5-year warranty.UPDATE: I just discovered that this fan cannot be taken apart for cleaning. I would change the rating to two stars if I could."
2,Very good,This is very good unfortunately it is just violins and cello I was really looking for more instruments. I am not disappointed though.
1,Original? Where?,"I must say I am extremely dissapointed by the latest Blink 182...oops...I meant the Box Car Racer CD. That's right, any of these songs could be found on a Blink 182 CD. This CD was supposed to be true punk rock, and less pop stuff like standard Blink 182. That is flat-out not true.Feel so is an excellent song, and the main reason I purchased this CD. Unfortunately it is far from the ""less mainstream"" sound that was anticipated. If you want true punk, go get a Pennywise CD, if you want pop-punk go buy a Blink CD...they are better than this anyway. Just download Feel So."
2,A great starting point for developing your own NT-based site,"Wyatt provides a reference that is across the board in terms of technical knowledge. Having been given the challenge of tying our in-house databases as an auxiliary website to our .com site, I found this book to hold most of the answers. He goes into step-by-step detail in many areas, but falls a little short of giving readers a broad view of applying the principles. A great reference that finds its way off the shelf and onto my desk a lot!"
1,Circle of Quilters,This selection was not received from this seller. I have written two e-mails to TSC books complaining about this issue and have had NO response!!!I will be seriously considering NOT purchasing anything from Amazon in the future if this is not addressed in a timely fashion!!!Thank you for your inaction.Sara Harbold
1,This reads like an outline for a Tom Peters book,"If you buy this book, you will end up asking yourself why you spent so much for something that is merely pages and pages of glossy color graphics with very little substance. 50% of its readers could pull these pearls of wisdom from any of the dozens of other career books and, if they had access to a publisher, come out with the same generic summary. Most points are very obvious and come with no suggestions on how to move forward on each point."
2,Bob Harper dvd,I thought i was inshape till i tried this dvd with my girlfriend...been doing this for 3 weeks now and its still kickin my butt.
1,Torture,"This book is the equivalent of someone taking interesting information, dropping it in the dirt, overcooking it using absolutely no seasoning and serving it with a side of vinegar. Awful...boring, verbally monotonous and it completely murders any interest one might have in this subject of immigration, race or sociology. There's no vocabulary highlights, no chapter summary, minimal black & white pictures, teeny tiny text, no interesting history or anecdotes explaining the fluffed up & often unnecessary verbiage. Just terrible. To be fair, I haven't even finished the first chapter..I'm so irritated and frustrated by the total lack of personality that I had to stop to vent before I've even finished to stop myself from either falling asleep or throwing this book across the room. Btw, this is required for a college Sociology class I'm taking and thus far I'm an A student."
1,Way too small!,"I couldn't find regular navy pantyhose, so I bought these instead. I hate pantyhose that are too small and creep down your legs, so I usually buy a size bigger than I need, which I did with these. I bought size EF and they are SO SMALL! I couldn't even get them on. Keep looking if you're searching for comfortable pantyhose."
1,Terrible...,"First night home from the hospital...wife doesn't want me in the room due to snoring. She just wants to call me in to change diapers, etc. during the night. So I set this monitor up RIGHT BESIDE her on her bedside table, I have the listening end plugged in for full power, volume cranked, and it sounds like a buzzsaw. I switched channels and it is no better. Then, on top of that, she could practically scream and it would be heard as a soft whisper to me. I am giving this 1 star because the motion sensor is neat, but I am returning this monitor. For quality sound, buy Sony (we used a Sony with our first child and it is clear and loud. We will use it again for our second). Sony is a top Audio vendor in the professional recording world, so if you think about it, this makes sense. As for communication with my wife, we bought motorola walkie-talkies and this has worked perfectly.Do not buy this monitor."
1,Disappointed,"After seeing the Blue Angels a couple of months ago, I was looking for a DVD showing them. I preordered this so that I would have the most recent. Unfortunately, all of the footage is very old, the background music is a bad variation of ""Danger Zone."" Being old, the picture quality is poor. This did not keep my attention nor the attention of my preschooler. I have only watched one of the DVDs out of the pack because of this."
1,annoying,"The work out itself is challenging. But, the woman's voice is sooooo annoying. Quick pace, gives a good workout, just wish I didn't have to have the sound on."
1,Had to send in twice for repair,"While I am happy with the performance of this camera, I have had to return it twice for repairs within 6 months of purchase. First the Auto focus had to be adjusted and recalibrated within a month of purchase, then I recently had to return it because the mode selection dial stopped working. I am a bit afraid that this camera will need to be replaced as soon as the warranty runs out..."
2,Newbies to Dir en Grey be warned,"I love Dir en Grey and adore this album, but I will tell you I had mininul exposure to their music when I heard this album and I was nearly scarred away from the band. After listening to it over and over (as well as hearing other singles), this album grew on me and I now love it.Those that are new to Dir en Grey SHOULD NOT listen to this album first. It is extremely dark, hardcore and can be a it disturbing. Though some may be able to handle it, it's best to listen to the Macrabe or Vulgar albums to get a better taste of their style first before sixUGLY.I still highly reccomend this album- especially if you're really upset and need mood music. This album's perfect. ^_^"
2,Excellent reference book but lacking in history.,"The Exakta Cameras Guide is a must and unfortunately really the only such book on these cameras. Sadly it is lacking in history of the cameras and company but it also explains that information is very hard to obtain given World War II, the destruction of the factories, The Soviet Occupation and other factors leading to loss of physical records, photos, etc. The book is however filled with crisp B&W; images of each variety of Exakt and a detailed description and Serial #'s to help identify the often similar looking models.If you are a collector or user of vintage Exaktas this book is a must! Buy with confidence but look for a bargain used copy as the new ones are pricey!"
1,TMI too much information!!,I was really disappointed in the 3rd book in this series. The 1st two books I expected some background information to bring the current story into play. But this book spent 3/4 of the time into background information (this happened back because of this & that blah blah blah blah). I found myself bored beyond belief. I am disappointed as this definetly doesnt meet Ms. Hamilton extreme work's of art out there.
1,It was great until the warranty period was up!,"We bought this coffee maker after having a horrible experience with the now-discontinued Kitchenaid coffee maker we received as a wedding gift. This morning my husband got up - came back to bed and told me the coffee maker wasn't working. I got up, unplugged it, replugged it - hit all of the buttons, etc. NOTHING. I came to Amazon to read other people's reviews to see if they had similar problems. Apparently this is not an isolated incident! Unfortunately, we bought this coffee maker one year ago - pretty much to the day - and of course I can't find my receipt. It's going in the garbage tonight and we're buying a new one tomorrow! Maybe we'll buy eight $10 coffee makers for the same price, so when one of them poops out, we have back ups!"
1,The Innocent Man,A very boring slow read. I had to force myself to finish over several days. I can usually finish one of his books in a weekend. Grisham needs to stick to fiction
2,Amazing!,"I loved the final cut since I first heard it, but since they included ""When the tigers broke free"" on this remastered version of it, I love it even more. Its true that this is more of a Roger Waters album than a Pink Floyd album, but the music is absolutely. If you liked The Wall, you should at least give this disk a chance."
1,not good,"These boxers were extremely see-through thin; not like what I've purchased elsewhere. Also, not in original packaging, but instead were repackaged, loose, in a clear plastic bag with no cardboard, no tags or labeling attached at all."
1,The worst book ever!,"This book is a total joke. After reading a review of this book in the Economist, I really wanted to see how bad it was. Don't waste your money, this is simply a collection of badly written essays that attempt to attack Michael Moore. I would rather read a book on spelling by George Bush."
2,BodyBlade,"I purchased a BodyBlade since being introduced to one during a physical therapy for my injured shoulder.I find the BodyBlade exercises are gentle to the shoulders and arms, yet very focused. The intensity and duration are totally controlled by the user.Although the BodyBlade is held by the hands, the exercises provide benefits to the entire body. By incorporating the BodyBlade into my exercise/rehab routine my shoulder pain decreased and my strength increased. In my case, shoulder surgery was NOT needed. I highly recommend the BodyBlade as an exercise or rehab aid for home use. It is light, easy to use, compact, and very effective."
1,BAD PRODUCT,"Purchased this item from Target, thinking it was a Great Deal, due to item was on Sale for Christmas December 2003. System worked Great for approximately 7 months. Keep in mind, that I only used the product actually 4 times total, in the 7 months.Unit does not power up anymore, apparently when you shut off the unit, it stays in standby mode, with a red (led) indicator light. Well the light is no longer on, and the unit does not power up at all. Unit is completely dead.Other electronics on power strip still working fine, so it wasn't a power surge or anything.Not worth the aggrevation and expense to get the unit checked out or repaired. Save your money,and buy a different brand."
1,Seiko is not what it used to be,"I have owned a couple Seiko watches over the years, but this will be the last one. Within a couple weeks of receiving the watch, the stainless steel wrist band came apart. Really inferior quality control. I guess that's why the watch was so inexpensive; I should have known better - now I do!"
1,Do not buy!!!,"I purchased the Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizer. At first I was quite pleased. However, when it is in the dry mode, the unit continues to heat up to unsafe levels. Hot to the touch. Having kids and dogs I could never leave this item plugged in, especially when not at home. Also, I had the impression that this was a refurbished item, which I believe the company is required to tell the purchaser. The instruction booklet looked like it had been handled before. I received an e-mail from the company asking for a review which included their phone number. I tried unsuccessfully to contact them with the customer service number they provided. Five days straight, the number was constantly busy.Only way to get in touch with them was via e-mail. I was finally given a full refund, however, there is something shaky going on with this company"
1,Bukowski's worst book,"Hands down this is Bukowski's single worst book. Bought it when it first came out just before/after his death in 1994. Having read just about everything the man had written, ""Pulp"" was a hugely disappointing epitaph. If you've never read Bukowski start with ""Post Office"" or the short story collections, but avoid this like the plague. A bad book. I can't think of a single reason to recommend it."
2,Great ladder for the price,The egress ladder was easy to install less than 5 minutes and great price but use your own screws; you will be very happy with it ... delivery was fast!
2,DMAE Cream,I have been using the DMAE Cream for a month now and it is very moisturizing to my skin. It is smooth and silky. I am completely satisfied with this product.
1,It didn't meet my expectation.,"I have the same opinion with the reader from Philadelpia.I think this book has just very simple, common rules of McKinsey and some rules is already well known to public. The book doen't explain good method, tools Mckinsey has.There are no details. When he introduces 'MECE', he should have explained the 'Logic Tree' in detail. But he didn't.I think the rank of sales results from only the name value, 'Mckinsey' and marketing effortsSo I would not like to recommend this book."
1,I wish i could give less,I am a senior in the honors class and I have read more than most adults. This book was recommended to me after I finished all of Chuck Palahniuk's books and all of Baer's books. An English professor at the college in my town told me that his students loved this book. I absolutely hated it. The book being believable is an understatement. All the kid does is smoke weed and whine about how terrible his life is. He steals from his parents and generally screws up. He never learns his lesson and he continues going about his life of crime. Some readers may sympathies with Bone's bastardized upbringing but that won't make readers enjoy this book. Many people may compare this book to Catcher In the Rye but these people probably haven't read it recently; for it they had they would realize what trash Rule of the Bone is. Banks cannot even compare to the mastery of Salinger. Please read another book and don't waste your time of Rule of the Bone.
1,Was not able to download. My computer did not allow it.,When I purchased this online for watching online my computer would not allow me to do it. I thought that I would be able to watch it on my computer any time. Not so. Please be cautious when purchasing instant videos as some computers will not allow
1,Did Not Fit the Knife and Fork,I tried to order the knife and fork set in the presentation box but everyone was sold out. So I ordered the Mundial Knife and Fork Set separately and then ordered the Presentation box. The description says the the set will fit in it but it does not fit. It looks exactly like the box in the picture of the 3 piece set together but when you purchase the box separately it does not fit. I wrote to Mundial but have not had a response from them so I am very frustrated at this point. It was a gift for my brother on Christmas and he used the knife and fork to carve the Prime Rib so I cannot return it but it still needs a box to store it in.
2,A Great Follow Up,"""By The Way"" is a triumphant sequel to ""Californication"". The title and first track begins with a beautiful chorus which ends up woven between the rap-punk verses sometimes with a harmony amazingly performed by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It's a track that reminds the listener of a funky ""Under the Bridge"". It combines the best of both talents the Peppers possess- the ability to create pretty music and remain defiantly punk-rock. The rest of the CD is a whole lot slower, letting the Red Hot Chili Peppers experiment with new harmonies and different guitar riffs. Even the harder rap stuff is peppered with background ""Ooh""s and ""Aah""s in harmony. Also, unlike other albums on the market, it stretches to more than 68 minutes, nearly filling the CD and giving the buyer a fantastic value for the money. This is one album you can pump up the volume on and not completely offend the neighbors."
1,Disapointing after 2 years,"Shouldn't things last longer? How long have we been making telephones? I was happy with my my Motorolla phone for the first year. I didn't use it a lot (my cell phone is my primary number) though used the Motorolla for local calls and to screen calls from mortgage broakers, etc. After about a year, the keypad started going out (intermittently), it's gotten so bad that I can no longer use it to dial out. Just recently, there is an aweful static in the handset- it's junk now. If Motorolla can make a tiny cell phone that stands up to daily wear and tear you'd think making a big, clunky, old-tech, landline cordless would be no problem and it would last..."
2,"Good Tarp, Lighter than Canvas, Will Last Longer!","No product gets 5 stars, as nothing is perfect. However, this tarp is a great buy at the cost, as it is both lighter than canvas, and made of a more durable material, and will last you a good while, if taken care of properly.I grew up with nothing but canvas tarps, and they last to this day (I'm 24), but are riddled with gaping holes, that make them virtual useless for what I needed this tarp for--setting my tent on top of it to protect the tent's bottom from the wet ground.The grommets do not feel cheapily made, but I can't comment on their functionality, as I don't use them.Overall, it's a great size, and a great value for the money. Shipping is a bit rough, but the product is rather heavy. I received my item surprisingly quick, as I am in Missouri, and this shipped from Oregon."
1,A One Note Book,"This book is very simple and repetitive. The title says it all. It could be useful, however, if you are the type who gets fixated and obsesses about guys who are not really available or interested in you. If so, you may want to do some deeper work on self love, which is the key to finding a partner who truly cherishes you. Check out my Amazon list, ""So You'd Like to Find a Love Relationship..."" for some great books that can help you on that path."
2,Dali produces a little gem,"I saw a Dali exhibition of his art in Melbourne Australia in june 09. Amongst the exhibits was a 7 minute dvd of a surrealist love fantasy which Dali made in collaboration with Walt Disney productions.This film is a whimsical lyrical glide through Dali's surrealist world. Truly a little gem.I also saw some of his ink and pencil drawings.They depict a technical mastery which has been compared to that of DaVinci. Most great artists are masters of drawing.You won't be disappointed with ""Destino""."
2,This book rocks!,"The authors have a refreshing collective voice, and it's so great to finally be encouraged, rather than be told the usual statistic, 'only 30% of women have orgasms-- you should just be content as you are.' I am so thankful that I found this book by chance; I'm buying copies for friends already."
2,Good old time book on tactics,"Really, all combinatiions involve some type of tactics. And, and combination in particular involves piece capturing. For the novice or mid-level chess player knowledge of all tactics at all phases of the game (books on traps cover tactics in the openings - important to know, books on checkmates cover yet another type of tactic) - all important to know. Though an old book, using descriptive chess notation (which is akward for many), this is still a worthwhile book to consider. The ideas are clearly pointed out and will be helpful for improving your game! Just because a book was written many years ago does not necessarily mean that it will not be very useful!"
1,Post Partum section is extremely bad,"I used this video along with two other videos; yoga, and buns of steel. I purchased this video because of the two sections it has and was really looking forward to using the postpartum after I had the baby. The prenatal routine is long but it is not hard at all. When played the postpartum section I found out that is entirely explanations of exercises to regain your fitness level there is not an actual routine I was really disappointed. Also my OBGYN told me that I could exercise six weeks after delivery, and the postpartum section is about your first six weeks after delivery. I would not recommend this tape."
1,You get what you pay for!,Get the yellow Champion. this one was a waste of time and money. The first one broke so had to have another shipped. The second one broke and that was enough for me. Both times it was internal things that you can't fix yourself and both times it was within the first hour of operation.
2,Audiovox DVD/TV,"This is a pretty good small TV. The image is sharp, the colors bright. The only thing I wonder about is how difficult it's going to be to disconnect the cable. The TV connector turned when I tightened the cable connection and I didn't tighten it any tighter than I've ever tightened any other cable connection. Time will tell."
1,The Options Course,I was disappointed as I ordered a used book and it came to me as a very early addition.
2,Season 7 was Great!,"I loved season 7, just as much as I loved the other seasons. I just wish there were more episodes. I can't wait for the Inuyasha the Final Act english dub. If you think Inuyasha is over after season 7, just wait, because there is more to come. I love Inuyasha and want more and the animation in this season has improved from the first season. If you're an Inuyasha fan, you'll enjoy this season."
2,Animal house meets the Firm,"In The Pledge, a first time thriller by Rob Kean, I really enjoyed it. I could see some spots that should have been pruned vigorously (Shawn is not exactly a realistic woman, she is somebody's(probably most men's) fantasy. Mark Jessy the hero is interestingly flawed, the scenes with the parents of the murdered pledge are poignant in the extreme, the rhyming gets a wee bit tiresome, and in short, Animal House meets the Firm. I could almost see Neidermeier spitting out ""pledge pin!"", although Jessy was entirely too appealing to be Bluto. Ah well, I'm dating myself. Two thumbs up, a good read."
1,Spanish Guitar...typical Toni by far.,"I was almost disappointed in the verbal content of the album (especially ""Speaking In Tongues"" which I found to be blasphemous to those who really comprehend what ""Speaking in Tongues is), and counted it as a bad investment until I heard ""Spanish Guitar"". Being more of a jazz aficionado, it's Toni's sultry voice that appeals to me most. Again, the verbal content is a bit for the younger, single audience but I think ""Spanish Guitar"" will appeal to the more mature audience. I hope it's made into a single!"
1,junk!!!!!!,"i have had a lot of time on a weed eater. i live on a large farm and have had lot of time this is the biggest piece of junk on the place. it is heavy,under powered , adn does not run smooth at all. i do not recommend this weed eater to anyone."
2,great,I owned this. Many years ago n i really did well with it not only is it fun but a great workout too
2,Good for fans of L. M. Montgomery,"If you're not a fan of L. M. Montgomery's work, you might not find this book very interesting - for me, most of the interest came from parallels between her own life and that of various characters in her books, and her explanations of things like how she started writing her first book, why she didn't borrow her characters too closely from real life, etc. I'd have liked to read more of her accounts of how she wrote this story or that.The book is mostly about her childhood and various anecdotes and events from it, along with accounts of how she came to be a published writer. It's fairly short; you can read it in less than an hour, so if you want a good, meaty book, this is not for you. But it's nice to read about her from her own point of view - her journals make good reading but this is more of a summary of info she considered interesting or relevant."
2,Thought I would get more...,"I thought that since this movie was a colaboration effort that it would be more action packed, but it was still a good movie."
2,Excellent for holiday party planning!,"A complete guide to holiday party planning from recipes ,shopping guides and personal stories.This book is a must for any cook from beginner to professional.you have to get it!!!!"
1,Could not finish...,"I wanted to love this book especially since I took it with me on a long trip. After 50 pages, I ended up having to leave it in my hotel room. I suspect it was likely the translation as the introductory matter, translated someone other than the book's translator, was beautifully written."
1,well designed but needs more care with packaging,"This grill arrived with a crack on the cover. Damage during shipment is not the fault of the manufacturer, so IMO Amazon could have boxed it more protectively.I advise all buyers to save all packaging until they know the product they have purchased is satisfactory."
2,"""Chants et danses de la mort""","Galina Vishnevskaya has made many historic recordings, including ""War Requiem,"" ""Boris Godunov,"" ""War and Peace,"" ""Tosca,"" ""Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,"" ""Eugene Onegin,"" ""Pique-dame,"" and ""The Poet's Echo."" But this 1976 recording of Mussorgsky's ""Songs and Dances of Death"" just may be her greatest effort in the recording studio. In fact, she and the late Mstislav Rostropovich had recorded the original piano version in 1961, but here they are heard in Dimitri Shostakovich's masterful orchestration of the cycle.Vishnevskaya's singing is terrifying. Her evocation of Death is without pity, indeed without any vocal ""beauty,"" in the usual sense of the term. It seems, rather, a struggle before the forces of Life and Death, so vivid is she. Once heard, it is never to be forgotten!"
1,Pathetic movie feels like a made for TV movie! Rent it first,This movie literally borrows scenes from many action movie. It is full of plot holes...The story is OK. The DVD has OK amount of features. Rent this pathetic movie first(unless you like Treat Williams or B grade action movies!). I would go into details about the many plot holes but that would ruin it for other readers/viewers. Just be sure you rent this movie first before you buy it!
1,Tintin - a product of past thinking,"I was really taken aback to see the view of other cultures represented in this work. At some level, I know that peoples consciousness at the time was less enlightened but it was truly unnerving to see such blatant racism on display. I suppose there was some value there in the historical lesson, even if that wasn't the intent of the author. Awful!"
2,Rounded Out My Sound,"When I bought my B&W; 803S speakers a couple of years ago, the sales person recommended a sub-woofer. I certainly couldn't afford the matching sub that goes with my new speakers. But I've been keeping an eye open for a sub-woofer and reading all the reviews. Finally the Polk Audio PSW 505 was featured and I broke down and got it.It's amazing how it has rounded out my sound. Paricularly watching HD tv with just a stereo set up.My only beef is, I wish there was more literature on how the controls on the back work and their purpose.It was totally hit or miss and it took me a while to get the setting just right............I am not big on bass for bass sake."
2,Makin Moves but where are they NOW!,"I wanted to get this cd for a long time now and now that I have it I found other songs on the CD that were the BOMB! My favorite song being U Better Be Ready is TIGHT! Other songs like Makin moves, If I Show U, Everyday, and Red Lights are also cool! BUT one question bungles my mind! Where are they NOW! Man, if they came out with an album like this again I will defintely get that. Oh well I guess thats what happens!"
1,Ultra-Violet-- No Way,"As long as WB insists on Ultra-violet digital copies, there's no way I would buy this set. I want a digital copy I can actually watch without having to stream or sign up for another service."
1,Poor Quality Home Movie,"As a cruising family, we can relate to the events(positive) and as the techno side of sailing is scant (negative).The viewing offer should be at no charge and we would like a refund."
2,Amazing head trip,"I never thought I'd see myself writing these words, but this business book seriously changed my life. One other reviewer stated that he read the book multiple times, and I took the same approach with the following result:First time: I didn't get it. Richard uses a lot of jargon and has some very far out concepts. His ideas are sound but his approach is eccentric, which make me realize I definitely needed to spend more time on it.Second time: I was getting it. Not quite, but the jargon made sense and the ideas were locking together in my head.Third time: I not only got it, but was reading each section in the context of the whole, with which I was now familiar with.Fourth time: I not only got it and saw the whole picture, but was now applying the concepts to my own world.I haven't read the book for almost seven years and I still use it every day. Reading and applying it was a most rewarding experience, to say the very least."
2,"""ISLAND SOUNDS"" By Wayne Harada.","By Wayne Harada Advertiser Entertainment Editor-Honolulu Adevertiser-Saturday September 2-2000SALSA HAWAI`I by Rolando Sanchez & Salsa Hawai`i, ARC--RSC Music, EUCD 1575.Rolando Sanchez & Salsa Hawai`i is the king of salsa in the Islands; this European import galvanizes that title, with both romantic ballads and sultry uptempo fire in the lineup.Sanchez stirs instrumentals with vocals; he is joined in solos by singers Cynthia Romero and Judi Palmeira and there's a wealth of joyful listening, not to mention dancing, in the likes of ""Todo Todo Todo,"" ""Solu Tu,"" ""Que Bonito"" and ""Voy a Bailar.""It's a perfect party platter."
2,good,"nothing fancy - but he got it here early. there really isn't much else to say - I bought a book, and it came."
2,If You Dare,"If You Dare is a good story, I liked it, but I didn't love it. It was interesting and it held my attention but its not something I would re-read, like I would A Hunger Like No Other, another romance by Kresley Cole. Courtland MacCarrick is described as a handsome scot rougue and Annalia Tristan Llorente is described as a beautiful castilian. Annalia finds him by the river beat pretty badly and unconscious. She takes him in to care for him, even though she knows she shouldn't since she can tell he is a scot. When he regains consciousness he is captivated by Annalia but he feels he should hold back due to the MacCarrick curse that haunts him and keeps him from ever marrying. All in all I found this story to be kind of average. There is passion and romance, but I felt there should be something more."
1,I want the old Anne Rice back!,"I can hardly believe that the first three books of the Vampire Chronicles were written by the same author of the latest three. When i read Interview, and Lestat and Queen, I fell in love with the characters as well as Ms Rice's story telling talents. I don't understand how her writing could have changed so much. It doesn't seem as if the first 3 books were written by the same person that wrote this boring, drawn-out, plot-less story. It doesn't work Anne. Please, give us more of the interesting, easy to love stories like you used to! And why must you ruin our respect and love for these characters by telling us about child molestation, which is what goes on in here. I don't get, how the best books I have ever read (the first three), could be written by the same author of this latest disaster."
2,great for home use,"I am really happy with this little fax machine, perfect for what I needed. I read other reviews before buying and was a little concerned about quality - not anymore. If you are looking for a high-volume fax then you should be looking at higher priced faxes. If you are looking for a home fax this is PERFECT. It is a wonderful size, easy to use, set up was so easy I thought I must have missed something. I think this is a real good buy!"
1,One bite and it was done,My 80 pound boxer mix quickly decided taking a bite out of the ball was a much more effective way of getting the treats out. It lasted less than 10 minutes.
2,"Great product, saves lots of time and sticky fingers","Love these filters - unwrap, install, ride. Only complaint is the price...can it be so expensive to spray oil on the filter and bag at the factory?"
2,More syrup for your pancakes?,This record is probably the strangest of all Metallica. The first 4 tracks are the best. Low Man's Lyric is a nice branch off the Metal tree and Fixxxer has a nice fat sound. The rest I can live without. Certainly not their best or even close but it IS another page in the life of Metallica. Metal Forever!
1,Awful,"It must be me, I like technothrillers which are technically accurate. The story is really hard to believe and it is hard to imagine that everything from a nuclear torpedo to a kamikaze vs. a cruise missile would really happenPerhaps the worst part though for someone who likes their technothrillers accurate are all the misstatements. It says there's a Mark 49 and Mark 50 heavyweight torpedo. Mark 50 is already the name of a lightweight one.then, there is this piranha class submarine. Why say this as though it were really a class of US submarine? Also, the note that US submarines don't use anechoic tiles. How could this be. Read jane's. The list goes on. From plot to accuracy, it's awfu"
2,Good buy,"I thought they be bigger as they were for a truck ,I installed them and they look nice on the truck"
2,Another great volume,I love iCarly! I am so glad to have the rest of season one. However I do not care for the last episode ihave a love sick teacher. It was really not one of my favorites but i loved the others. I also liked that it came with the pilot of True Jackson VP. That show is cool too. So if you love iCarly then buy this. You will not be sorry.
1,Don't buy it,"I was very excited about fresh flowing water for our kitty. I kept reading that fresh water is critical for cats so really liked this concept. But after assembling & setting up, BIG disappointment. Motor is very loud, water splashes & leaks. RETURNED."
1,Worthless cheap product,"I was planning on use this rings to make egg patties for breakfast... Not anymore. To begin with out of the box only 1 out of the 4 rings would lay flat, every other ring leaks when I would pour yolk mix into them. After storing them away they got deformed and leaked even more next time.Save your money... I actually had better results using a can of beans cut-open on both sides!"
2,Perfection,"I love every track on this CD, just like I love every track on all the Liz Story CDs I own. It's a permanent part of my holiday season."
1,My experience as a novice cake decorator,I was disappointed in this cake and food decorating kit. As a novice to cake decorating I was upset that this kit did not come with instructions to show what each attachment would do. I ended up returning it and buying a different product.
2,Jessica Does It Again!...,"Jessica Andrews has done it again. Her new album ""NOW"" is phenomenal. Jessica does an excellent job delivering beautiful lyrics. It is great to see her doing so well. This album Starts with the first single ""There's More To Me Than You"", which is my favorite song on the album. ""When Gentry Plays Guitar"" is one of those songs that just gets stuck in your head and you just sing it over and over. ""I Wish For You"" is a beautiful song about wishing the best life has to offer for someone. ""To Love You Once"" is a fun, kind of pop sounding song that just lifts your spirit. These are just a few of the songs on the 16 track album, number 16 being a hidden bonus track of the ballad version of ""There's More To Me Than You"" which is just beautiful. With ""Now"", Jessica is establishing herself with the country greats like Faith Hill and Martina McBride. ""Now"" is definitely worth every penny you will pay for the album. GREAT JOB JESSICA!..."
1,Disappointing,"The beginning started out interesting; then character development just didn't really happen as the focus became more on the romance; and the story line dragged and the dialog became repetitive. I will read it through to the end as I'm already 70% committed. This was not what I expected in light of the ratings it received. I was expecting sympathetic characters in line with Girl w/Dragon Tattoo, Hunger Games, even Twilight and The Hostess. I could not buy into the characters--they are all too nice and unreal--kinda made me want to gag. People really don't think/speak in full dialog as this writer depicts. I would summarize that this is a Reader's Digest read: a Harlequin romance trying to be a detective story. I seriously doubt I would read anything by Dee Henderson again after this flop."
1,Hugely disappointing,"I bought these after my Apple Earbuds stopped working, and after reading many positive reviews I had high expectations. After the bass heavy muffled output from my Apple Earbuds, the ER6i's were a bit of a shock, much better treble and midrange, but virtually non existent bass, I mean almost none. I tried adjusting the EQ settings on my Ipod Touch to Bass Booster but this resulted in distortion at very moderate volumes. I'm not a bass head by any means, but I expected a lot better from these particularly when it says 'Enhance bass response' on the box."
2,Fhilippinos Left Out,"A great story that needed telling. I was impressed with the opening scene of the massacre at Palawan, an item usually never mentioned which gave the reason and urgancy for the operation. The main emphasis was on the 6th Rangers (The father of a friend of mine was on the raid) which left out the real efforts of the Alamo Scouts. Worst yet was the treatment of the Fillipine guerrillas. Not only did they protect the Rangers from Jap attack, they engaged them at consederable loss. Contrary to the movie scene, the Rangers did not come to the help of the guerrillas. Minor detail was that the plane that overflew the camp was a P-61 Black Widow, not a Lockeed Hudson. For more info see Hour of Redemption by Forrest Bryant Johnson and Silent Warriors by Lance Q. Zedric."
1,Very disappointing,Badly conceptualized and badly designed. There is no auto-off. Poached eggs are cooked unevenly. Difficult to figure out settings.I would have returned this if I had not tossed out the poached insert.
1,Hapkido Vol.1 Disappoints,"This video produced by the Korea Hapkido Federation brought back memories of my own training in dojangs looking identical to this one while I was in Seoul.Unfortunately other than nostalgia this video has little to offer other than acrobatic demonstrations of what should be very practical techniques.The agility and the abilities of the practitioners are not in question, however this video does not really seem to know what it wants to be. It is not in any way instructional. It does not show realistic execution or reaction to the techniques shown. This demostration, like many I saw while living in Korea, seems to confuse acting and acrobatics with martial arts.This is really a shame as these practitioners are, I'm sure, really talented and could illustrate real hapkido if allowed to do so.A real missed opportunity on the part of the KHF.I would recommend Ultimate Hapkido in its stead."
1,Don't waste your time,"Someone needs to inject a little reality among all the rave reviews on this page. This is a horrible book, a muddled mess. Its biggest problem is Amy, possibly the world's most shallow, unlikeable heroine, who truly doesn't deserve the happy ending she receives. The charming hero (the one saving grace of the book) is so appealing one wonders what he could possibly see in a twit like Amy. Plus, the book sometimes steps back and takes a detached, omniscient-narrator tone that is supremely irritating and simply doesn't work. Worst of all, the book isn't funny at all, although it tries valiantly to be.I realize that not every piece of literature needs to be deeply meaningful, but it should at least be well written and somewhat convincing. This book fails on both counts, and on many others. Avoid it unless you're in the mood for a less-straightforward version of a Harlequin romance."
1,You Must Not Remember When They First Came Out!,"All the reviews that i'm reading that Cypress Hill is back nonesense must be too young to remember when they first came out. While this is better than stoned raiders, and it is the best attempt i've heard in awhile it still falls short. But like some of you have said it's not their fault entirely, alot of rap now a days goes right to the can. I'd definitely listen to it before I bought it if I was a new purchaser."
1,"slow, slow, slow",could this game take any longer? And the conversations that you can't get out of... boooorrriiinnnnggg. Don't buy unless you have a lot of time.
2,Awesome Tail Light...,The tail light comprises of extremely bright L.E.D.s that not only shine to the rear but also to the sides of the bike. The only downfall is the cumbersome clip which is far from sturdy....Mine fell off while in front of a bus and the next thing I knew it was broken into 3 pieces....but I'll buy another if not attempt to call the company and see what they can do. All and all I'd recommend it...but don't rely on the clip which keeps it mounted to the bike....
1,The very worst of Jane Jacobs,"I finally picked up a copy of this book, assuming that Jacobs might have been picking up early signals of decline. Well, she did observe that a housing bubble was in the making and would eventually burst. But that's about it. I don't recall EVER reading a book that outlined its main thesis in the first chapter and then did so little in subsequent chapters to support it. In fact, the rest of the book is like a collection of justifiably-rejected magazine articles strung together. Having read her thought-provoking 'Systems of Survival', I found this a huge disappointment, one of the worst books I've read in many a year. How the book could have garnered any glowing reviews from any respectable journal is simply a measure of the lack of integrity of the press: she's an eminent author in her late 80s; let's be nice and give her a great review. This is a great thinker's last and least. Do yourself a favor and skip it."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"My son got this for Christmas and it does not work as it claims! If you see this toy and think to yourself, ""That looks cool!"" Think again and remember what I'm saying.......DO NOT BUY IT, unless you like to return things. Customer service couldn't help and would not offer another product for my cost."
1,Downout lies from an American Idiot,"Kitty Kelley is the biggest moron I have ever seen. I cant believe anyone would believe this B.S., if you want the truth read ""Unfit for Command"""
1,Do not buy if you live in New York City,"This product is nice, it charges your phone besides streaming audio to your car radio. BUT, if you live in New York City do not expect to use it for more than charging your phone. When I am in Queens, it works ok, once I start driving across the bridge into Manhattan forget it, too much static."
1,Lacks inspiration,"I found the Bridges of Madison County to be full of emotions and uncommonly well written. Each word was important and each feeling rang true. I liked it so well that I then went on to read all Waller's other books and found them all to be good, not all excellent but certainly good.This sequel feels like it was written as a compromise, by someone who didn't feel at all like getting into this story. This book totally lacks inspiration. I always felt as if the writer was being careful to be clear, but did not feel at all the feelings he was giving his characters. As well, a lot of the typical Waller expressions, such as ""last Cowboy"" and such, don't come off at all. They sound dated and don't succeed in instilling a mood. It almost feels as if this was a group effort. Overall a very disappointing read."
1,Another worthless book,"Yet another worthless book from Karen. This author loves to take any opportunity to attack anything thats symbolically male,including in this case,the world of business which was created by men.Men should not feel guilty or apologize for that fact either,nor should they be sympathetic of the ""female struggle"" in business or any other domain of men.Its important to note also that men created the free-enterprise system and all business schools,as well as higher-education in general."
2,Couldn't put it down,"The Cover Up was an intriguing novel that kept inviting back for more. I couldn't put it down. Everytime I thought I got to a point where I could take a break, I was drawn in again.The characters became friends. These were people I knew and could relate to. The plot thickened and the characters remained true. I couldn't predict what would happen next and I enjoyed that.This book was a great find. Thank you, Michele!"
2,pretty good book,"this book starts out with the scooby gang helping out joyce summers at a sidewalk art fair. when xander keeps buffy from getting hit by a bunch of sawhorses falling off the back of a passing truck, he thinks he has pschic abilities. when everyone else just brushes it off, he goes into a funk and avoids everyone. that leaves him plenty of time to get to know one of the hot artist that is working in the show. when she volunteets to do tarot card reading for him, he is already to go. afterwards he is withdrawn and the scooby gang thinks that he is just upset with them still until oz also gets a tarot card reading from them and becomes withdrawan and distant. the scooby gang jumps into action to find out what justine(the hottie from the art show) is up to and barely escape with their lives. this book was worth reading even though when you read the back cover it sounds pretty dead....."
2,Jade - Good film,Having seen this film on video i was really looking forward to seeing it on dvd but i think the video version is a lot better the uncut version is espesially better as it contains more nudidty and the ending is diffrent linda firentino is brilliant and i particually like the bedroom scene when she as a stocking over her head (strange or what) overall the film as many twists and turns and is really enjoyable i would recomend getting it
1,Lasted 2 times,First one received was broken. Second one lasted two times and will not work anymore. Unit did not get wet on inside. When it did work it made the pool look awesome.........
1,Why do kids need to know that baseball players cheated ?,"I am very disappointed with this book. I was really hoping for a children's book that I could use to introduce my 8 year son to Babe Ruth. But, instead, I read a book that refers to baseball players and cheating. In the end, I will never read this book to my son. In my opinion, young children do not need to be introduced to the concept of baseball players cheating. My suggestion, publish a book that highlights Babe Ruth's accomplishments as a world series pitcher that becomes baseball's home run legend. I do not recommend this book."
2,A good book to aquaint yourself with non-linear writing.,"To understand the workings of the human Id, it is nessecary to first deny it. This book is an introduction into how they were doing it. I strongly recommend that anyone interested in the literary happenings of the Beat generation should have this book as a launching point for further investigation. If you read it, there will most certainly be further investigation."
1,So so,"This is so-so entertainment. The only reason, though, that I saw it was to see Mick Jagger (I'm a Stones fan). And he is terrible in this! I saw him act in ""Ned Kelly,"" and, while that movie was a bit slow, he gave a very good, natural performance in it. So he CAN act. But he's really awkward in this movie. Really, really awkward. And Emelio Estevez has no charisma whatsoever. Rene Russo has such a masculine jaw, she looks like a drag queen. And Anthony Hopkins is too short and chubby to be a convincing empire-building-villain. But the script has some good things in it, and it's the screenplay that keeps this movie above water a lot of the time."
1,It takes over your computer.,"I'm a professional and have purchased QuickBooks versions every year since 2002, and additional years prior to 2002. That said, the 2007 version has an entirely different front-end design which one has to get used to. But more importantly, I suspect this new version interferes with the operation of XP Profesessional on my computer. I'm not an IT guy, but that's my take.I resent software which installs user IDs on a computer and modifies the computer's normal operation. I've only used the software briefly for one client, but I know this...my computer will not shut down normally. I now have to click ""turn off"" twice. And when I boot up, I now have to select myself as user because QB2007 installed a user for itself.Sometimes developers should just leave well enough alone. I can't wait to uninstall this thing."
1,I hope you like hip-hop music,"Well, this CD is disappointing, to say the least. I really enjoyed Ruben's performances on American Idol, and was looking forward to this CD for months. Now that I have it, I find myself skipping half of the tracks.Sorry 2004 and How Can You Mend A Broken Heart are the best songs. No Ruben, What Is Sexy, and Can I Get Your Attention are simply awful. I feel cheated by this album."
2,Where do I get it?,"I would really like to have the movie, book and CD but I am unable to find them? I am sure they are worth enjoying. Why can I not purchase them ""anymore"" as in Unavailble.?"
2,The sinking of the whale ship Essex,"This book is a wonderful story of the lives of the sailors on the whaling ships of the period. Their adventure on the ship Essex as it left port sailing for new grounds . Little was know about the islands of the Pacific and in thisstory it was a sad effect that could have made their rescue shorter and saved some lives. Some parts of the story even though it was factual was too much detail in the death of some of the ship mates.Their lives, after their rescue, I found interesting in the way that they personally found solace in the jobs theytook up.I would recommend this book. It was the chosen book by our Book Club of women and all found it interesting ."
2,It was good! But too easy...,"I liked this game A LOT! But the only problem was it was too easy. I do recomend this game for beginners, but if you are a pro, well you can still get this game for such a great price$If you are a pro, try some Mega Man games."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"This is a difficult book to rate because it is strong on a few points, but extremely weak on others. It provides the most detailed history of Westmoreland Glass that I have ever seen, and some of the facts are fascinating. However, it is very, very, very poorly organized. Photos are not always identified. Many items are discussed but not depicted in photo or sketch. The price guide in the back uses different names/descriptions than what is used in the text of the book, so you can never be sure if you are checking value on the correct item. I enjoyed the book, but if you want to learn more about various pieces of Westmoreland glass, you will need to buy other books. Unfortunately, I cannot offer advice on what others because I have not found a good one yet. Lorainne Kovar's books are GROSSLY OVERPRICED and still do not do the job they should. I would NOT recommend Kovar's books on any subject."
2,A necessary addition to the chiropractor&#65533;s library,"Chiropractic therapy continues to be helpful for neck and back sprains from acceleration/deceleration injuries. Chiropractic approaches are not based on manipulation alone, however, as we also engage education as a cornerstone of effective therapy. For chiropractors, Life After Whiplash provides simple, easy to understand explanations for the symptoms that accompany spinal disorder. Chiropractors can use this book to expand their repertoire and provide more complete care by giving Life After Whiplash their patients. I am now routinely providing my patients with copies of this book as part of the essential part of their therapy and insurers are willing to accept this as part of therapy costs. The better informed patients are, the better I can help them, and the more they value my services. I have only just begun handing out this book, but so far feedback from patients and insurers has been good."
1,Queensbridge is falling down.,"True this album has some 2 or 3 hot joints, but the majority of this is that watered down electronic style that we had to deal with since Murda Muzik. Mobb Deep has kissed the concrete beats and the intricate ""reality rap"" style that they had mastered goodbye. Now they kick basic ""thug rap"" and use experimental electronic (synthy) beats. ""Get Away"" and ""Burn"" are my favorite joints on here. But make no mistake, the Infamous/Hell On Earth Mobb Deep will never be back.Plus the old Prodigy is dead, so we have to listen to his new super simple (and super slow) rhyme style once again. After taking a heavy beating from both Jay-Z and Nas, be prepared to throw a rose on their career's casket."
1,Poor quality product,This facial sauna emits less steam than a hot cup of coffee. I was sorely disappointed. Had previously owned the Kaz steamer and that worked great!
1,The Queen of Hip Hop Soul - No More!,"When I first heard that Mary and P. Diddy were getting back together, I thought this album would go down as a CLASSIC! I am glad that I am one who can admit to a mistake. This album is far from a classic, it is at the bottom of the list of all of Mary's studio albums. The sad part about it, is that Puffy tries to use the same formula that made What's the 411? and My Life such works of art. This album lacks the passion that a Mary joint needs to be successful. It appears that every song on the album is a testimony to Mary's current happiness and inner peace, a message that you don't need 15 songs and 3 interludes to get across."
2,"Pretty Good, but There Are Better Alternatives","This book is quite interesting and it covers almost every aspect of computer and peripheral hardware. It's fun to read and almost reads like a novel. But, there are several bad points: many typos, some of which are very misleading (esp mixing up megabits (Mb) and megabytes (MB), for example); out-dated (was written in 2003, and lots has changed since then); and some sections are either very boring or very confusing, but this doesn't happen too often.This book is probably not good for an absolute beginner because some sections do not provide enough background for what is being talked about, but someone with just a small amount of background info should do alright. I've heard of other books that are similar to this one but which are newer and better, so I'd recommend looking for a different book first. Technology changes quickly, so recently-published books are important."
1,stupid,"This game is simply ridiculous. I think that the whole idea of virtual tennis is stupid. It is a very complicated game(tennis). Mario tennis does not give you the control that you need for tennis. If you like tennis, than get off your butt and go fing a tennis court, get a raquet and play REAL tennis.anyhoo, back to the game, It's a little fun but it has no longevity."
1,Sinking fast,"I sworn that I would never read another book by Hamilton but I decidedI would try one more. What a mistake that was!! Hamilton has just aboutdestroyed Anita Blake! I was 200 pages into the book and still no plot just Blake turning into a porn queen!!!! I really can't believe that Hamilton has trashed Blake to the point of no return, It's a shame, the first 7 books were just great, what the hell happened? and it looks like am not the only one thinking that way. Never again!!"
1,They phoned it in...,"FROM BUTTERCUP'S HUBBY: This game is very disappointing. I have bought all of the Medal of Honor games and each has been better than the last---until this one. They are just trying to extend the brand while they work on the PS3 and Xbox games. No new weapons, no new scenarios, not very challenging, very average. Rent it, don't buy it. There is a reason why this game is opening at $39 bucks when all of the others started at $49---it's Rocky V."
2,Simply cute and practical!,"I needed spoon rests that wouldn't break when my roomies knocked them off the stove. Something that no matter what, I could scour and make look good again. I found this little gem. It's sized for maybe 1 egg, but is perfect for a spoon rest, change catch, or even hanging on the wall as country kitchen decor. It's cute, practical, and compact (essential in the modern clutter-kitchen). I've bought 4 so far."
1,Far less than 120 capsules,"Only started taking the product 10 days ago, so am not sure just yet how well it's working for me internally. My gripe, however, is with the amount of capsules contained in the bottle. The manufacturer claims it provides 120 capsules. However, I just did a count and only 60 capsules remain in my bottle. I've been taking 4 per day since I started 10 days ago, so by my count, that means I was only provided with 100 capsules."
2,Queen of the Galaxy,"I first saw this movie in a small theater outside West Point, NY in 1968. I remember the theater as it had moths on top of the popcorn in the dispensing machine. The movie was innovative for the time. And one of the characters is Duran Duran the inspiration for the band by the same name.In the 41st-century astronaut Barbarella (Jane Fonda) receives a message from the President of Earth (Claude Dauphin) and is tasked with a mission to track down a threat to the earth, the scientist Duran Duran (Milo O'Shea,) inventor of the ""positronic ray."" On her quest she must go through many trials and tribulations. We get to experience them vicariously. Put your tongue back in.Will she find Duran Duran before it is too late?When Jane looks back on her extensive career this will be her crowning performance. She never really re-captured that Barbarella spark.I think that Barbarella inspired the opening scene of ""My Stepmother is an Alien.""My Stepmother Is an Alien DVD ~ Dan Aykroyd"
1,DO ALL MARINES HAVE BLUE EYES?,"Overwrought dramatization of the Guadalcanal campaign. The marines all look like actors right out of acting school. There is a droning over voice saying anti war platitudes. Of course, all the women at home are beautiful with not a plump or pimply one among them.Sean Penn is at his worst here.However, there are some well done battle scenes."
1,disappointed,"I bought this toy for my 9 year old son who loved it at first but after awhile he was dissapointed. It stopped working correctly on one side. The remote may be the problem, I am not sure. We changed the batteries but that did not help. I felt bad I bought him a Christmas gift that didn't last the day!"
2,Reality Hits Home,"This book brought to life the hard core reality of the mean streets of West Baltimore. Unfortunately, the reality that Tavon and Juvenile lived happens to be a reality for many of the urban youth in today's society. I can see the growth in the writer from the first book to this one and it is amazing how he has been able to increase his ability to lead you through the streets of Baltimore from his eyes. I felt that I was a part of the story myself. Thanks for the amazing ride."
2,"Money, Murder and a Dachshund! What more could you ask for?!","I really liked this movie! Yes, it is a bit silly, but it is a movie for the whole family to enjoy! Plus, it is set in Monte Carlo with (the late)John Candy and a Dachshund! I also liked the music, and George Hamilton is a spanish gigolo playboy with a great tan. Also, the several sub-plots, especially with Cybil Sheppard, I thought was played very well. Oh, yes, don't forget the murder of the unseen Dachshund owner! Overall I really enjoyed it and have seen it several times."
2,Very Excellent,"This game is a must if you like first person 3d shooter. Quake provides a wide variety of game play. The multiplayer aspect of the game makes it worth playing over and over. There are many mods (modifacations) that you can add on for extra and different game play. Team Fortress, which is by far the most popular mod, is the most fantastic multiplayer game out there that I've played. Also for those of you who are nerds, Quake II multiplayer actually shrinks the players and makes you think that the levels are actually bigger. :)"
1,Dated and old skool,Classic Weaver stance text book which has been left behind by new techniques. If you want to see how your Dad was taught in the 80s then this book is for you!
2,Candy Crate,When I received this item it was like being a kid on Christmas. I made my way through the packing material to find out what 70's era candy was included. I was pleasantly surprised by many of the items/brands included. Most I remembered from my childhood and some I had never seen before.
2,lots of horns,"horns. lots of horns. i like lots of horns. reminds me of a jam session where the best of horn players show up.the horn ensembles playing rhythmic choruses repeatedly gets to be a bit redundant, but the many solos make the recording. lots of energy."
2,Sing-a-long SFA,"It's been a really long time... I cannot even remember the last CD I sung along to ;) But this one just cannot get out of my Bose CD system (installed in my 350HP S4...Just bragging').I play it when I go to work in the morning and when I come back home in the evening, it almost covers the growls and hisses of my engine... Sheeee's a gooooolden retriever!"
2,Chazown,"Many books I've read have been titled the word that the books subject matter covers. In that way, ""chazown"" is very similar to lots of books I've read recently and in the past. However many of the books I've read have not always provoked me into action. In that way, ""chazown"" is very different than those books. Craig Groeschel doesn't just get you to ask the question of ""what"" is my vision. He gives you the steps as well as the tools to help you see that vision come to fruition in your life. Step by step, day by day. (sounds like a them song) He even quotes ""what about bob?"" Baby steps :)If you haven't asked yourself the question ""Do I have a vision for my life, What am I doing, and what SHOULD I be doing?"" then this book would be great for you to read. If you are on the journey through answering these questions you would also benefit from picking it up. You'll enjoy Groeschel and his writing style. He makes you laugh, cry, think, and most importantly DO."
1,To put it nicely: Not up to par.,"I greatly enjoyed his previous books and I eagerly anticipated reading ""Hannibal."" Now all I can say after finishing the book is, ""What! "" The book had its good moments but there were long periods that lulled me to sleep. I felt that the author betrayed the two great characters of Lecter & Starling with his awful conclusion, and in doing so, betrayed the fans that built his fame. Lecter's macabre mystique and power & Starling's balance of strength and vulnerability? - the authors throws all of this out in this book like used kleenex. I would say it ranked with ""Godfather III"" in disappointing sequels. If you are a fan of Silence of the Lambs, my advice is: read the first half of Hannibal, then make up your own ending - you couldn't do any worse."
1,Rob,"This player had good picture quality and sound, however, the unit boke just over a year after purchase. The picture still works but the audio no longer comes through. It is going to cost $150 to repaire and the warranty just ran out. Needless to say I will not purchase a toshiba as my next player."
2,Has given us insight,"If writers lacked the right to approach the same subject from different perspectives, we would need only one book about Thomas Jefferson. Currently there are about 600 in print.What's so wrong with a book that goes into the personal side of the man, that it has to flush out mean-spirited critics who spin out irrelevancies and go off on tangents? Those critics show a complete lack of understanding of high-functioning autism, clearly a possibility for Jefferson on the strength of the evidence.I think Norm Ledgin has given us insight about the nature and character of Jefferson that I wish other writers had tried to do. They scratched their noodles about TJ's odd behavior but didn't even come close to trying to figure out what made him that way."
1,This Bicycle is Complete Garbage,"What a disappointment!!! We bought this for my 4 year old son for a Christmas present. He asked Santa for it several times and was so excited that it was a ""John Deere"" themed bike as he loves his grandpa's John Deere tractor. Thank God we tried to put it together before the holiday or else we would have had one very sad little boy on our hands on Christmas morning. The forks the hold the front tire onto the bike do not align at all, making it IMPOSSIBLE to get the front tire onto the bike. Aside from this major manufacturer defect, there also are no assembly instructions included with the bicycle. All in all, this product is very cheaply made. Now, not only do we have to buy our son a new bike someplace else, but we have to explain to him why Santa couldn't deliver the ""John Deere"" bike that he asked him for. Thanks Learning Curve."
2,Hauntingly Inspirational,"I ran to buy this CD after seeing ""The Passion"" and I have nothing but an excellent rating for this soundtrack.The music is haunting and wraps you in a cloak of inspiration. Perfect of meditating, praying, pondering life as well as relaxing after a long day. I personally find arabic type music breathtaking and many songs on this CD carry whispers of instruments that are not often heard on American CD's. You are able to envision biblical times, with harems and tribes and all that life offered even the tragedy and triumph of Christ. John Debney has orchestrated a masterful soundtrack that I highly recommend for those of you spiritually inclined."
2,"Not bad, could use improvements","Considering I bought this from Amazon for 29.99 I couldn't be happier. I would, however, be upset if I paid more money. For one, this unit really needs a recharging cradle instead of having to stick in the dinky cord end each time I want to recharge the unit (which is going to be ALWAYS). Second, the bristles on the unit are too short and a little too firm, not really making it ideal for hardwood floors but better for tile. Finally, it's a little on the heavy side which makes it a bit awkward to use in tight spots. Overall though, for 29.99 you can't go wrong. No way would I pay full price, however, with all these deficiences."
2,Computer vision,I think this book is the most complete computer vision arguments. In fact it start to speaks from radiometry to steriovision passing by filter uses!!Good very good
2,Purchased this as a gift.,"Received in timely manner - before Christmas. Purchased as a gift for my son according too his ""wishlist""."
2,Let Sara Transport You to Paradise,"After hearing the NPR interview with Sara Tavares, I immediately ordered her CD. Her silky voice whisks me away to pink coral beaches and warm ocean breezes. Like waves washing over pebbles, I find myself mesmerized by the tracks of this finely composed album. Thank you, Sara."
2,No Bullying Around,"M. LaVora Perry has written a book that truly reads from the heart. The character descriptions are fresh, honest and open -- not the standard way of describing physical features. For educators -- a great story to initiate a discussion about bullies. Children were very responsive and involved during the telling of the story (especially the end of Chapter 2) and had lots to say regarding bullies and how to handle situations peacefully. This is a story to treasure!"
2,Great fun!,"This toy is durable and fun. I purchased it even though some people wrote it was a hazzard. My 3 and 5 year old love it. It is made for younger kids ( as the age range suggests) whoever, puts a 10 year old on this is not very smart to begin with and is looking for trouble! This toy is great for the age range specified. It will keep a 3-7 year old happy for hours, but any kid over 7 has no business on a 12 volt plastic ride on toy! People need to use their own judgment and not write these silly reviews about how their old kids got hurt on these toys."
1,This item is very disappointing,Causes lights to blink on and off constantly day and night Makes no difference what type of bulb ie incandescent or flourescent / Tried repositioning and adjusting the aperture cover in accord with instructions Nothing corrected the defect.
2,Who needs drugs???,"""Angels with Dirty Faces"" is definitely not party music, unless it's a party full of stoners and heroin addicts. Throw your bongs and needles away! ""Angels"" is dark, gloomy, erotic, and euphoric without the mind numbing affects of drugs. His electronical blues leaves me begging for more."
2,Where does Ireland get all these great authors?,"The Irish have always been known as great storytellers, but now they're all turning into great writers as well, and it seems they're coming out of the woodwork. Sebastian Barry's The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty places the protagonist in the small village of Sligo where he is an innocent among angry partisans. When he chooses to alleviate his problems of employment by taking a job with the Royal Irish Constabulary, the British-led police force, he irrevocably alters his life - as you might imagine! With beautiful language and ethereal descriptive passages, Barry allows readers to follow Eneas' travels and travails - all of us hoping for a happy ending."
2,The Awesome Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"""Creativity"" by John Steptoe is an excepitional story about two boyy who learn being different is something speacil. My favorite part is when Charles did sometime nice that Charles gave Hector a pair of his sheos. I think John Steptoe could have made Charles tell Hector that you don't were does kind of shoes. You should reccomond this book.3rd grade srcibe at C.L.A.S"
1,Crappy Battery,Batteries last 1/2 the time I replaced them with. The ones I replaced were over a year old and still lasted twice as long as these.
2,Collectables,"This is the real Halloween 3. The sad thing for the series is Halloween 3. I DID NOT LIKE the fact Michael was not in the movie, still its not a bad film on its own, I DID LIKE H 20, it answered a lot of qestions regarding the family tree, although im still confused if Jamie had a daughter or son. The spooky atmosphere makes these films. My favourite movies are pts 1-5. Pt 1 - 3 brings me back to my youth and the DVD transfers are fine, if you are after something intelligent, this is not for you, for the films are a fun and entertaining session of good-looking horny teens getting slashed. Not great but what the hell its all popcorn stuff anyway. If anyone is interested in Halloween collectables, email taylor5821@hotmail.com"
1,SUNPRO TACHOMETER,"The tachometer out of the box is light, simple to hook up, and looks like a high end professional tach. But, after wiring up the tach, the background light only worked for the first few hours. The tachometer needle sometimes jumps all the way past 10,000 rpm. Sometimes it doesn't work at all. Rechecked all wiring, and is hooked up correctly. I have this tach installed in my 2008 Kawasaki Teryx and its possible it cannot stand up to the pounding of off roading. I will end up purchasing a different tach."
2,"Good books, entertaining audio book","The Nora Roberts AUDIOBOOK CD collection for The Villa, Midnight Bayou, and Three Fates were entertaining. They were abridged so you don't get the full affect of the books, but the main storyline and characters are there for all to enjoy a 2nd time."
1,"Really,why?","It took 10 minutes of this movie to make me bored. What a story! Ok, so this COULD be an exciting plot, but what a bad way to let us all down. The all to usual love story that just couldn`t happen to be let out of it. The almost pathetic way of realizing the characters. In every aspect, I was so terribly let down. Let`s just forget all about this masterpiece of terrible directing. It is not to be bought at any cost, and I mean that!( They could have put Eddie Murphy in there, and it wouldn`t have mattered even in the slightest!)"
2,Cheers to Dr. Alsop!,"Dr. Peter Alsop has done it again. This gifted performer has taken on yet another serious topic, that is the related topics of death/grief/loss and used his talents as a vehicle for exploration. The tunes are catchy and the lyrics flow together smoothly and well.All in all, a solid performance. This is ideal for parents, educators and children. Heck, it's just plain GOOD!"
2,Closer to 10,"I've read or listened to every one of John Grisham's books. I've liked them all, but some better than others. THE FIRM is still my favorite.I enjoyed THE PAINTED HOUSE, although it was a little slow. I did feel, however, that there were several strings in the story that were left untied. But the book held my attention and I would recommend it to others.My last comment is that I feel the main character is/was closer to 10 years of age; he was too mature for 7."
1,Maybe for cookies,Not happy with these at all. The batter sticks even after spraying with PAM. Also tried rubbing with oil still sticks. Also they must be filled with so much batter that before you can turn it over the first side burns.
2,One of the best...,"I have read every kind of fantasy novel from Eddings to Jordan. This book is my favorite. I love reading it today just as much as the first time I read it when I was tweleve. In fact, I just ordered a new copy because my old one is worn out. I cannot praise this book enough."
1,When not all (nor any) is equal(ized),"pb wroteThe recording engineer, mixlogist or post recording specialist must have been distracted. Major kerfuffle in settings and balance."
2,CCSF is a solid program,We enjoyed this documentry on CCSF and college football in General. IT is a real life depiction of Jr college football. Love George Rush and the program at CCSF. First class.From a parent
1,Not really worth it.,"I have been learning Russian with a tutor for 16 months. When I first started, my first tutor recommended I buy this book as a supplement. Needless to say, I am no longer with that tutor, and this book only collects dust. First off, there is no possible way to teach yourself Russian using only a book. The case system is complex and sometimes things just need to be explained before you can start using it. This book only teaches things like colors, numbers, dates, weather -- but you could finish it 4 times, and not be able to hold any sort of conversation. Unfortunately, I have don't really any other recommendations as I now use a book my tutor brought with her from Russia. All I know is, that you will not learn much from this book."
2,Another Field Guide to seldom seen birds,The second field guide parody of bird guides by the author/illustrator. Good for a laugh each time you pick it up. I see something new every time. The illustrations are excellent and the descriptions are hilarious. If you are a birdwatcher this book and the first one are a must. Good for practical jokes on fellow birders.
2,love equals madness,"when that love doesn't turn out to be quite what you had in mind... I hope the male readers aren't put off by the title (because this novel is for both sexes.) I guarantee you both men and women will be able to relate (if you have ever been burned by love). The author goes for psychological insights and the book will stay with you for years for this reason. A sad and incredible tale, reads like non-fiction torn from today's headlines. What a motion picture this would make, on second thought, maybe Hollywood ought to keep away, as they, more than likely, would ruin it. Five stars easy. The damn thing left me in tears. Not an easy thing for a straight male to admit, not to mention it also helped me get over a bad love affair. If you've loved and lost you know that's something that can easily push you over the edge. If you happen to be going through something like that at the moment, I suggest you read the book and it just might keep you from doing anything stupid."
2,"Spine Chilling, a plot turn every page",The setting of a small town holds intrest and innocence. After this book was written I sure they would have had to redefine the meaning of horror. Through dreams Jodie McCullough is drawn to an ancient burial ground and is consumed by its immaculate powers. Recomemded for anyone who loves absolute terror.
2,Way cool!!!,"The character developments of Memmit Nadil and Odan-Uur were great! The art is abseloutly incredible! If you are an aspiring artist, use the scetches in the back for references!"
2,Include it in your collection before it becomes hard to find,"A great album from the golden times that i did NOT believe that it is available, since i used to listen to it on tape i was surprised by the CD and needless to say that it didn't come out of the cd player for almost a week."
1,Sooooo Disappointing,"Save your money. The only other Elizabeth Lowell books I couldn't get through were the Enchanted/Forbidden/Whatever stories. This book not only continues the storyline, but in the present, it continues the boredom. I was disappointed from the beginning but forced myself to continue reading because I figured, ""Hey, it's Elizabeth Lowell."" Don't bother continuing. It doesn't get any better. I couldn't understand what the point was, and didn't know any better at the end of the story. I'd feel a bit better if I had waited and bought the paperback."
1,An Unfortunate View of Anger,"Dr. Semmelroth and I have very divergent views of anger. He begins his book by stating that anger is a form of insanity. Once he takes this shaming and distorted view, he has some mildly positive suggestions on how to attend to the most aggressive forms of anger behaviorally. I define anger as ""the natural healing energy the body generates to respond to injury."" This is a compassionate view of anger, which I believe is a normal human emotion. If you are looking to understand and heal your anger instead of trying to get rid of it, don't look here."
2,Great Tripod,"I have a very light weight camera, a Panasonic Lumix, but I wanted a rock solid tripod that wouldn't cost me more than the camera, for taking videos and stills, especially at lower shutter speeds. I have found it to be rock solid, very quick to setup and adjust and put away. It has some very nice features, like quick snap locks for the leg extensions, a solid base, a level bubble incorporated into the tripod, it locks quickly on all the axes, and has a removable plate that screws into the camera tripod screw socket so the camera can be attached to or removed from the tripod instantly. I am extremely pleased with this tripod. I couldn't be happier."
2,:: dies laughing ::,"All I can say is I WISH there were more DVDs with John Pinette's stand up. He's got to be one of the funniest comics around, and we LOVE LOVE LOVE him!"
2,sick game!,I have only rent it.Its a realy sick game!You should buy it! pros:1.scenes from the movie2.you can pick carhter (ghost or noibe)3.you can drive or shoot cars behind you cons:1.no blood2.to long3.third person shooter Over all its a great game and worth your mony. Hope you like it!
2,really raw,Corinne clery who starred in Moonraker with the great Scot s a good enough reason to watch this video or own as I do now. Franco Nero is a good actor who carries out this thriller to the dark end.
1,disappointed,The paint is wearing off of this and looks awful. We shouldhave gone to Kohler in the first place.
1,Underwhelmed,"This movie was not what it was cracked up to be. It was in fact cliche and predictable, but worse yet, NOT SCARY. If anything it was irritating. These little creatures I guess are supposed to be super strong or something but if these things are coming at you, I think you'd put up more of a fight than the characters in this movie. I mean make me feel you're at least trying to survive. It's like a grown-up letting a 3 year old beat him/her up on purpose. That's what this felt like to me. The only thing I got into was the relationship developing between the little girl and her soon-to-be stepmother played by Katie Holmes. And then to piss me off more, Holmes' character, who was my favorite in the movie, 'dies' or is turned into one of those stupid little freaks. Blah! Not for me."
2,Entertaining but short,"A very entertaining novel but at 250 pages, only takes a weekend to read. Is it just me or is anyone else out there getting tired of spending $20+ for 250 page efforts. It makes you appreciate Clancy, Michener and King who will at least give you a novel that can keep you entertained for weeks at a time"
1,Incredibly Dull and Wandering!,"Rambling and pointless, this overhyped tome seems the product of a relentlessly clever sophomore. Imagine Nicholson Baker without the painstaking eye, David Foster Wallace without the searching intellect, or Rick Moody without the verbal talent. There's nothing here that Monty Python didn't do in the credits to their Holy Grail. There's not a belly laugh in the whole damn book. ( )."
2,Great product,I ordered this because so many people are raising chickens these days. My mom and my boss are always given away eggs. These are really handy and I don't have to worry about the eggs getting smashed in the process.
2,Worked as needed!,I used this for my son's Portable DVD Player. I put some of his videos on it and it worked great. His DVD player actually uses less battery power by using this instead of the DVDs. I have had it for awhile now and have zero issues.
2,Fabulous!,"This book was scarier than the first. Dr. Erin Tyler definitely has a few problems this time and needs everyone's help. The villains are deplorable and I couldn't wait for them to get their due. Thank goodness for Steve Robinson. What a rock star he is! He can save me any day or night. I like the `behind the scenes' concert stuff too. I love how the author made the book steamier this time. Steve's hot! Erin's hot too for you guy readers. The last quarter of the book must be read at one sitting. You won't be able to put it down because the action never stops. The medical stuff continues to be easy to understand and I found that I learned a little too. I think that just about everyone would enjoy this book, even rock stars! I can't wait for the next one."
2,Second disk with Gessinger on the Bass,"This is a guitar disk. After Gessinger (singer) startet playing bass no the band, and released theyr 2nd disk full with bass, this is guitar time! Augusto Licks uses all his soul playing songs like ""Variaes sobre um mesmo tem"" and explodes in ""Cidade em Chamas"". Good, but not the best of this band."
1,fly fishing video,a real disappointment. video was less than basic and not very informative. i was expecting much more from scientific anglers.
2,Destructive Emotions,"I thought this book might be more of a ""how-to overcome"" or ""prevent"" destructive emotions so I found the presentation to be a little disappointing. The format was an academic-type of discussion to prove the truths behind Buddism and it used a lot of scientific jargon."
2,How to Draw Pokemon,"My 4 kids are all Pokemon crazy and they love to draw, so this was a natural choice. They spend hours drawing their favorite characters with the help of the How to Draw Pokemon book. I Highly recommend this for any kid that is a fan of Pokemon and loves to draw."
1,Fair,Bad DVD defected I played it and the first DVD was defected and i was disppointed in it big time .
1,Worst in a long time.....,"The acting was fair for what the movie was, but the ideas of the movie were horrific. If you are going to make a movie about some one that is transgendered, then why not get an actual transgender to do it? Also, I was offended by the fact that the boy was gay just because he was molested by his step father. Piss poor directing and story line!"
2,Brilliant!!!,"As I live in Canada, you may see why I'm in love with Jack Johnson and his music for many reasons. The first being that his music just rocks my invisible socks--silly but true-- and once again who wouldn't rather be in Hawaii like Jack than in Canada like me??Back to the music...This album is sweet, you should definitely buy it as soon as you can. Just get your hands on this exquisite music any way possible, and put it on your pod, although i don't recommend stealing it. heheh."
2,Nice Addition for Guests,"Ordered two of these luggage stands after staying at a B&B that did not have any place to put luggage. Came home and looked at our guest room and realized that we didn't have several important things for our overnight guests. One was these folding luggage stands, the other was a wall mirror. Ordered these folding luggage stands and they are just what I was looking for. The quality if good and the wood finish is just OK. But the fill the bill for our needs. Only negative is that I'd like to have had the wood stain a bit lighter. It's almost black....not a dark cherry or mahogany as I expected. But they'll do just fine."
1,Avoid this,"Motorhead collectors should steer clear of this one. It is the 1982 Toronto Maple Leaf Gardens concert, I believe, purposefully mislabled as being a Canadian concert from 1988.Any idiot would know that Fast Eddie was long gone from the band by 1988. Yet, there he is playing guitar for them, but the year is 1982.This was a disappointment. The packaging is an outright lie."
1,Requires you to install software from *Sony*,"And just what sort of intrusive DRM comes with that software THIS time?To quote Homland Security to Sony Executives ""It's not your computer."""
1,OS Support Poor,"The package mentioned Wondows 2000 support, but Windows 2000 fails to detect the new hardware. I got stuck after buying the card. The card works fine with WinXP."
2,5 years and still OK,"Bought a ""no frills"" model 5 years ago & it's still working well. Bottle stoppers didn't work. But I have an assortment of 30 round cannisters plus two marinade & they get a lot of use. No cracks yet, but I wash them by hand. However, a few lids have lost their sealing ability. Soaking the rims in warm water didn't work. I follow Tilia's tips: Cover very fine contents (sugar, flour, flaxseed meal, etc.), with a coffee filter cut to size. Fill within one inch from the top and keep that space clean. Wipe inside of lids with damp paper towel. Open the lid of an older FoodSaver for 20 seconds after sealing. Wait 20 seconds before sealing again."
1,Not really good,"Well I don't iron at all, so I decided to buy this steamfast because everyone said it was so much easier to iron, but the it wasn't, all my blouses get wet, and still with wrinkles, is just not working, maybe for things that are not so wrinkle, but bottom line, is not a good purchase."
1,CONFUSING!!!! GOES NOWHERE,"The word on this film was positive, but the film is a negative. Confusing goings-on with a clunk of an ending. This one goes straight to resale after a boring and laborious one- time viewing . A NZ flopper!"
1,Metallica now Poptallica,"Never would dream that a band that fathered metal and helped make it what it is today would sell out and make pop music instead of metal. Boring riffs, passionless music...we waited 5 years for this?? James Hetfield needs to grow his hair back and start making metal again, heh we can all dream right? Makes me appreciate SLAYER now more than ever."
2,HATCHET,"The Hatchet is about a teennager named Brain. It was in the summer when Brain was going to see his dad because his parents are seperated. When Brain was going on his trip he got a hatchet as a gift from his mother. When Brain was at the airport he got on a plan and got to sit with the pilot. When Brain took off the pilot asked him if he wanted to stir the plan but Brain was afraid but still he did it anyway. After awhile the pilot had a heart attact and he thought that it was something that he ate that morning but it wasn't. The pilot was knock out cold, Brian knew he had to fly the plane. Brain tried to call for help but didn't know where he was. The next thing he knows is he is waking up on the shore. If you want to know what happens to Brian and how he survives, read the Hatchet. It was a great book."
2,Great for Price,"This is a good mousepad for the price, but be warned-- it slides around a bit. It is very thin and stylish as well as being great for moving the mouse around. So the only complaint is that it moves with the mouse sometimes."
2,Very Intriguing,"This book touches on the topic of :what if Nazi Germany had won World War 2? It takes place in a in a post WW2 world with Hitler reigning supreme. The main character, Xavier March, has found a dead body in a lake and ends up in a murder mystery. After he finds that he has been pulled off the case for a matter of ""national security,"" he meets an American named Charlotte McGuire. After they meet they start looking into the mystery again and find things that Germany did not want the world to find out. This was an excellent book for anyone who likes a good mystery."
1,Not an appropriate choice for AP parents,"This book will be helpful to parents who can tolerate small bits of the ""cry-it-out method"" (Pantley offers a modified cry-it-out method), but it's not suitable for AP parents who believe that they need to respond to their babies' needs day or night. Nighttime Parenting by Dr. Sears offers a much more baby-friendly and parent-friendly program."
2,Fantastic Starters DVD,"If you wanna get in shape and get your body used to the basic exercise and heart rate it should be used to, this is an awesome workout DVD. It might be a bit tough in the beginning if you're not really used to working out, but that's the whole point. It pushes your body step by step to get to where it should be. There are 3 stages so once you feel your stamina is built on the first stage, move on to the next. Your body needs to be challenged in order to are results! If you feel some muscle pain, you're doing it right. I personally use the McDavid waist trimmer during the workout and I sweat 3 to 4x more in my midsection. Good luck everyone!"
1,NO GOOD,This device only lasted 4 months being used only once a day and that wasn't even every day. Now it is DEAD. No steam. Cold espresso. Called customer service and left a message 2 days ago and still no response. This is a piece of crap machine.
2,What your doctor Won't or Can't Tell you,That is the book we should all be reading. I think you'll be shocked to read what goes on in the world of medicine. Written by a practicing cardiologist in New York.
2,Sex Diet,"This CD set is a great tool for any couple wishing to inprove their relationship, whether the relationship is new or old this will at fire to your life. It is worth making the time to try this Diet."
1,Really,I was a little lost watching this movie. It didn't really make sense to me. What woman invites another woman into their relationship.
2,Great book for people from other programming languages,"The book doesn't waste you time on the basic concepts that are universal to all programming languages. It's not a simple compilation of instrution sheets for you to follow step by step like the dummy books. Instead, it teaches you WHY. It's relatively slow to read this book, simple because it packs more useful info onto each page than the other books out there. I would rather spend the same amount of time crawling through only 10 pages of this book than flipping through 100 pages of some other VB book and still learned nothing."
1,I have a headache,"Picking up this album gave me a good feeling, after all I'd liked Port Royal and loved Death or Glory, so figured I'd take a chance on them. Bad move.OK, to specifics - this album is like walking through mudflats at low tide. There are a couple of occasions where the lyrics or the music picks up, but really what weighs this release under is the combination of so-so production and also the feeling that everyone knew that Death or Glory had been their artistic and commercial highpoint, and that there was nothing more to look forward to.Which is a pity as I always had a soft spot for this band. My tip is to get Death or Glory. It's excellent. Then explore further out from there."
2,I can't compare it to their other work,"but I think this CD is outstanding. To a newcomer to Alison Krauss and Union Station, as I was, I would have to say that this music on the whole is less bluesgrass than you might think and more folk and pop than you might think.Even the more uptempo and bluesgrassy sounding pieces, like track 2, don't burn fire like some other songs I have heard elsewhere but are nevertheless beautiful in their relative restraint. And, the more downtempo songs work as well as any, if not better than most, straightforward pop ballads. As a previous reviewer noted, the title track is wonderful in its restraint."
1,"If You're Depressed, Listen to this CD","I am an avid fan of DMB (love Crash, Under the Table & Dreaming, and Before These Crowded Streets). However, this CD is so gloomy that it's hard to listen to. There are hardly any upbeat songs, and many of the slower songs sound alike. I heard that Dave Matthews was going through a depression when the band recorded this, and it obviously shows. Stick with the above mentioned if you are new to DMB. I strongly advise you not to purchase this mundane CD."
2,What a Deal,Four Decades of Song is a 3 CD Box set that is price so low that it seems like a steal. I thought for that price how could I go wrong and I was right the quality of the CD is great and the songs WOW! Shirley sure can belt them out. One of the nice things about this CD box set besides the outstanding value is the selection of songs it has many songs which I have been unable to find on CD before. I have been listening to these CD at work everyday for the last 5 months and still love hearing it. You can never go wrong if you like Bassey and this Box set proves it once again. Get it and I think you will love it also.
1,Not what i was expecting from tha dogg pound,"The Dogg Food album doesnt compare with their earlier songs on Death Row. Kurupt doesnt rap as well as he used to and the G-funk isnt as good as I was expecting. The only good songs are Dogg Pound Gangstaz, Respect, A Doggz Day Afternoon. The rest all sound wak and dont suit Kurupts styles."
2,Very Good Story....Very Abrupt Ending,"I thought the book was well written, the characters were complex and personable. I don't know much about Judaism or Jewish communities but it didn't matter when reading this novel. The author provided just enough background information on the unfamiliar that I didn't feel disconnected from the story, i.e., I don't think anything went over my head. My only complaint is with the ending. The ending couldn't have been more abrupt if the author typed in ""I'm done writing. The End."" That Blair Witch ending is why I'm giving this book 4 stars instead of 5. I think that Tova Mirvis is a gifted writer and I will definitely pick up some of her other work."
2,Picture Doesn't Do it Justice,"I had this watch delivered to my job since it was a Christmas gift. All of my co-workers were amazed when they saw this watch. The males were all saying how they couldn't believe the durability of the watch. The watch is simple yet elegant, which makes it formal or casual. I can't wait to see the expression on my fiance's face when he opens his Christmas gift."
2,Culturally educative,"I went to India twice, the first time for 4 months, and sadhus are definetly one of the most interesting people of the hindu world. Obviously their lifestyle is not comprehended by westerners and even less by closed-minded people who probably have never been to another continent with a different culture (as reviewer fro Hawaii); or if they have, they still have'nt learned to respect the differences and traditions among different societies. Since my first trip to India I saw this book on many bookstores there, and after comparing it to many others this is the one with the best pictures of the holly men. Incomprehension should not be a cause of disrespect; actually, this has caused wars, and still does."
1,Disappointing: Outdated and Not Useful,"This book was written in 1987! Technically speaking, it's completely out of date.My major criticism, though, is the low value of the content. Do we really need to be taught that soft or pastel colors appeal more to women? Not only is that kind of thinking outdated, but who needs to read a book with that level of ""information""?"
2,This book paid for itself in the first week.,"With a 512 Megabyte memory chip installed I was totally unprepared when halfway through a trip problems arose and I suddenly found myself unsure whether any pictures could be saved.My husband was reading ""Make: technology on your time"" and from this publication he learned that lost digital photographs may be saved.""Make: technology on your time"" provides comprehensive ideas for today's handyman (or woman). Saving my photos was the first benefit we've implemented.

1,The Worst of Kirk Whalum,Kirk Whalum is a fantastic saxophonist but this one is a disaster!! It doesn't deserve a mention let alone a place in the collection of true Jazz lovers. Please do not judge Whalum by this CD. I'd recommend 'Unconditional' instead.
2,Awesome,"The transaction I had on 8/21/09 was a wonderful experience. Initially, I was very jerky on getting my textbook online,because I was never a fan to that. As of the time I got my text,there was no other avenue of getting it except online. I had no other choice but to give a try because time to use it was running out. The seller gave me a window of 7-14 business days but I got within 3days. The text is ""Transportation of the sick & injured, 9th edition"" new one. It has been serving its purpose since I got it. It's awesome."
2,Very good,Great read it was hard to put down just like all of her books I can't wait to see what's next
1,WHY? Come on Paul! You've done this already!,"I am an unconditional McCartney fan. I have stuck with him even with such ghastly albums like ""McCartney II"" and ""Off the Ground."" However, while ""Run Devil Run"" displays Paul's love for the classics, it doesn't give us anything new. This record is revisiting what he did on the ""Russian Album.""In my view, the last good record that McCartney made was ""Flowers in the Dirt"" in 1989. There he demonstated his craft for solid pop melodies (something that has lacked in many other of his 80's works, (i.e ""Press to Play"" and ""Spies Like Us."") ""Flaming Pie"" seemed a bit vacant somehow.... almost anit-climactic. I was a let down.In any case, let's hope that Paul can come out with another solid pop album along the lines with ""Tug of War"" and ""Flowers in the Dirt"" and stop revisitng old material we've heard from him(and others) before."
2,Great Booster Seat,"We just ordered this for our 15 month old daughter. She loves it, and even asks to sit in it when we aren't eating. It's very easy to hook up and adjust, and light weight enough to easily carry to a restaurant or on a trip. I like the fact that it is very easy to clean and that the trays all come off and reattach very easily and are sized to place in the dishwasher or easily wash by hand. The cover also allows you to carry a dirty tray home without worrying about it getting on everything.It appears to be very well made and there are no parts that could pinch the baby (unlike our regular high chair).I would highly recommend this."
1,Too general,"This book does not really deal with passive aggression at all. It meanders all over the place, never gets to the point and mentions passive aggression only occasionally in passing. Thank God I read a library copy. If I'd wasted money on it I would be furious!"
2,Damaged Product,"The product works fine. I ordered the more exprensive one after I read reviews from others on Amazon. My husband likes the presser. It does a good job pressing his pants. However, it was damaged in the box when we received it. We decided it was too much trouble to send it back. The box was torn and the presser had a chuck knocked out of it."
1,Gladiator Costume,"Looks cool but the plastic is very thin on the chest shield, leg and arm guards. The face plate velcroes on as does the shoulder pads which pop off too easily! Every move my son made they were coming apart! Too many pieces for an active boy to keep in place for any length of time! This costume is cheaply made for the price!We were very disappointed in it!!!"
2,A Tremendous Buy!,I ordered this stemware to serve my guests Red Wine in a glass that would make them fill special and this Spiegelau Vino glass is the perfect one. I have received many complements about this crystal.
2,Shades of Beauty,"I bought this book because it showed how diverse we are. Our children need to know that no matter what color they are or what kind of hair they have, they are special. This book has beautiful pictures and words. I shared it with my co-workers and my children. I will uses it in my classroom to teach my students to be proud of who they are and what they look like. I love it. I plan to buy copies for each of my children and for my young niece. It is a must have for all African American families.Good job, Sandra and Myles Pinkney!"
1,Over-rated author and a poor excuse for a boxing book,"Anyone who believes that this book is an authentic portrayal of boxing has never stepped into a ring and has no sense of history or perspective. Mailer hero-worshipped Ali, and could never write anything objective about him. Mailer knew nothing about boxing, other than the sensation of hitting a woman in one of his drunken binges. Mailer went to Africa, and could not write the truth about Zaire or its bloodthirsty dictator. He either did not know or could not write that the stadium in which the fight was held, for example, was a killing field for criminals who were rounded up before the fight to make sure the event went smoothly for the press and the tourists."
2,Nice collection of eclectic poems,"There's a little bit of everything in this collection. You won't find any famous poets in this book, but the great part of this collection is its diversity. Varying topics and styles, it is definitely a fun and interesting read for the poem lover. A great gift idea."
1,Just plain awful...,......disjointed...disorganized...unoriginal...overacted...was this thing ever released in theaters?...they no doubt threw in a very brief nude scene of Elizabeth Hurley to try and make up for the mediocrity of the rest of the film...Leary looked uncomfortable through the whole thing...what a waste of talent.
1,"Not quite, there yet...","Close, but ... When this device shows color, and can run PIM applications, let me know and I will buy one. Many of the books and magazines I read contain color photos."
2,"Best firewire card for audio, hands down","Simply put, several different makers of firewire interfaces recommend THIS firewire card to put in your computer if you want unflinching reliability. Just goes to show, you have to go beyond what's on the shelf at a local store to get something specific like this for the PC Home Recording Studio market that computer accessory stores flat out ignore. If you can wait for this to come in the mail, it's a no-brainer."
2,Why can't a viscount love me?!,"Discovered Julia Quinn when I was 7 months pregnant and an emotional mess. Made the books so much more exciting to be a hormonal disaster. 2 kids later, I still love her books. If romance, especially historical, is something you enjoy, read her!"
1,one hour and eleven minutes,"That's how long I watched what I thought was a typical escapist B movie. I am a SPF fan and have watched most of his films for good or ill.I was enjoying this one until they had a character make the most dumb obvious rookie, stupid plot device possible. So for the last 20 minutes of the film I was not happy, especially when they had another character show up and be even dumber.So I give it a two star for Sean but it really should be a half star because of that last 20 minutes!!!!"
1,Toro 12 amp electric blower,The first time the blower was used it lasted for less than a minute and smoke started coming out of the engine. I returned the product to an authorized repair center and still have not received the unit back. It has been almost 4 weeks since it was dropped off. Now it is snowing so it doesn't do me any good...
1,A Poorly Assembled REMIX,"I love the song ""Build Me Up Buttercup,"" but when I found out the CD is a remix with only one song by the original Foundations I got a little mad. Oh well I'm stuck with it."
2,Great Aussie Cartoon,"Saw this cartoon when I was little & too watch it again was so overwhelming, I'm such a fan & living in Australia and understanding the culture made watching the cartoon even more better than when I was little admiring the talking animals and hoping Dot would ind her way home."
2,not bad,"I have more complaints with this book than I did with the first two, though I still enjoyed it overall. I got very tired of Father Tim's constant contemplation of his new marriage, how much it had changed it his life, and how he could hardly believe his fortune. How had he survived all these years without Cynthia? How could he have not known what he was missing? And so on, over and over and over again. This book seems filled with more cheesy dialogue, old-fashioned language, and quaint expressions than the first two. And it seemed to me that nearly everything written about Father Tim's and Emma's new computer was completely made up by someone who had never used a computer before. However, all criticism aside, I still enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the fourth one."
2,Javitch Read,"Dustin Hoffman in a comedy set in New York City. Hoffman plays an unemployed actor, Michael Dorsey. After his girlfriend failed to get an acting audition for a soap opera, he dresses in drags under the alias ""Dorthy Michaels"" (Great Alias...) and gets the job. Now most people thing that a movie like this would be realy stupid. But like the old saying goes; ""Never judge a book by its cover"" (Some Guy Page Unknown). Tootsie offers minutes after minutes of classic comedy, that are only matched by the greats on Comedy Central. 116 Minutes"
2,LOVE A ROMANCE....,I HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE ON T.V. AND LOVE KRISTIN CHENOWETH. SO I DECIDED TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION OF CHRISTMAS MOVIES.
2,Fascinating!,"My husband received this book as a birthday gift, but I beat him to it and read it first. Then I hounded him until he finally read it because I knew he would love it. I'm not a history buff by a long shot and rarely read non-fiction, but I found this book to be fascinating. It certainly gives the reader a whole new perspective on how much is involved in the President's public appearances. Joseph Petro has succeeded in producing a book that features political figures without getting into politics. He shares interesting and amusing anecdotes without crossing the line into gossip. This book is so great because it's a good read even for someone who wouldn't necessarily pick up a book about history, politics, etc."
2,Good movie,"I can not say that it is as good as Bourne Identity but it is along the same lines, still very good, and still worth seeing. Some here complain about Hanna because of its a storyline too hard to believe or perhaps fully understand. The story isn't really that hard to understand though but you do got to pay attention. What they're might be complaining about, I , is that the movie doesn't follow one of the canned formulas we see all the time. Well, I say to them, ""go watch Pee Wee Hermans Big Adventure ,"" and leave the rest of us to enjoy this film."
1,Best SCIFI i've aver seen,simply:Perfect Acting - many dynamics and personalities with great script & dialogueThe special effects are some of the best i've ever seenstory is going into third season - totally addictivei cant say enough good things about the seriesyou wont go wrong with this even if your are remotely into scifi.
2,Love 90% of it,Vicarious might be my favorite Tool song of all times.There's two songs on this that I don't love. The rest I found to be amazing.
1,Steer away from this product.,"The product promises a lot and delivers way short. I had to return 2 batteries because they didn't charge up (blinking light on first, then battery light not showing charge at all). The third one that worked only powered by fully charged laptop for 1.5 hours. That's 1.5 hours of web surfing. That is no where near 5-hours it promised. For the price, you are better off investing in a 2nd laptop battery."
2,Very Good Read!!!,This is a very good book. I believe everyone in ministry should read this book. It has a different angle than other leadership books but thats what makes it good.
1,Duh!,Don't waste even the $4 for this pamphlet unless you are a complete idiot. Let's see - the best way to deal with clay soil is to cover it with over a foot of good quality top soil (at major expense). Gee - I never would have thought of that! I'm surprised that moving to an area with better soil wasn't a suggestion as well.
1,Not very colorful,A bit disappointed with the color - pretty dull compared to the one showed in picture. And the material is not soft.
1,Yawn...,"I was so excited to receive this book for my birthday, especially after hearing all the comparisons to ""DaVinci Code"". I loved the historical intrigue of that book and eagerly dove into ""Rule of Four"" with the same expectations. Little did I know I would be reading a couple of college kids' creative writing class assignment. It was so cliched and dull. There was nothing that made me feel for the characters or their plight. I kept asking myself, ""What's the point?"" I'm sorry to say that I only finished it because I would have felt bad quitting half way through."
2,Excellent watch!,"The Seiko ""Black Monster"" is the nicest watch I own. It was really simple to adjust the stainless bracelet for my wrist with the link tool. It is very classy looking but not ""bling bling"". The lume is WAY brighter than another dive watch that I bought that cost more than twice as much. The bracelet doesn't pull my arm hair either, very comfortable. I am very happy with the watch, the service, and the fast shipping. Now I gotta have an Orange Monster too!"
2,what to listen for in CLASSICAL music,"On the back of my copy, it says ""the best book of its kind I have ever seen - deems taylor""I don't know if the latest edition still says that, but it's important to know what KIND of book this is. It was written in 1939, and its chapter on ""Contemporary Music"" is about composers who died long ago.It's not exactly a ""complete idiot's guide"" to the subject of what goes on with classical music, but it's close.Despite its age, it really is beautifully written and contains loads of good information about listening to classical music."
1,stopped working after two months,"While it worked, we like it, but after only two months it simply stopped functioning. We tried to repair it with no luck. What a waste of money. If you get this, make sure there is a return policy or a warranty"
2,A picture is worth a 1000 words and lot less pain!,"Although somewhat expensive, the video showed what I was doing wrong on the snatch and other techniques although I had read the book, ""The Russian Kettlebell Challenge."" Thus I improved my technique and reduced the pain suffered during Kettlebell workouts. Bravo, Pavel!"
2,"...singable, pleasant, up-lifting...","I must admit that I bought this CD with the intent of copying one or two tracks off of it and then returning it to the music store for a full refund, as is the trend these days with so many people who are tired of paying full price for a CD that only has one or two good songs on it. Well, I decided to keep it because the CD has about 6 or 7 really good songs on it. The only problem I had with it was that Peter doesn't hit the high vocal ranges that he has in the past which make his sound so unique. But the quality of the songwriting and production makes this a good buy. Definitely one of his better solo releases..."
2,Life Rules is Life Changing,"""I purchased this book for my 13 year old son to read. When it arrived I decided that I should read it first, just because I check everything out that affects his life to make sure it is something he needs to internally process. WOW, am I glad I did! This book is a wonderful, positive, powerful messsage for all the world to read. Since my family has read the book, we have loaned our copy to other family members with hopes of it bringing a change to their life. If you have never read or heard of these two words...Proactive and Reactive then they are something you must know about. They have the power to change your life and to change the lives of those around you!By the way, this is a PROACTIVE statement :) !!!"""
2,Works for me,"The Otis ""all caliber"" patch works fine for me on two different caliber handguns. I think the quality is good and compares favorably with the more standard square cotton patches. Otis' estimated six uses per patch is very optimistic. Three uses per patch is more realistic, at least in my hands. It does take some practice to get proficient at attaching the patch to the slotted tip, mainly where to pinch the patch to make it the proper size for each caliber. I recommend calling Otis if you have any questions about which size patch to order as part of their gun cleaning system-ditto that for all of their equipment. It is also worthwhile checking out the on-line videos so you understand how everything is supposed to work"
1,Manufacturing Issues,"A friend asked me to look at his ER-DVD Battery because he was having difficulties with it. It would work sometimes and not others, a slight bump could easily stop it from working and the LEDs didn't always accurately display the charging status. As part of my troubleshooting I took apart the unit, examined every thing closely and discovered that the manufacturer failed to solder in the wires on the top of the circuit board."
1,Poor Writing Style Marred the Plot,"I found it difficult to overlook the substandard writing in this novella! The dialogue between the characters was ridiculous and terse. What little content existed was wasted on weak character development. I cannot believe this made it past an editor's chopping block!!!!!If you cherish beautifully written prose and prefer the paranormal, try reading one of Alice Hoffman's (she is the author of Practical Magic)."
2,Every parent should have one of these,"I had wanted one of the Jumperoos since I was pregnant. They looked like a lot of fun and I didn't want anything else that would hang in the doorway. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any because Fisher Price discontinued them. But then I happened to see an ad in Parents that advertised a new and improved one from the company. I ran over to my Babies R Us and picked one up and it's been a joy ever since. My 6 month old girl loves it and can jump all day if I'd let her. It makes her laugh and her legs look like they're getting stronger. I highly recommend this for anyone. Hell, if they made one for adults, I'd get one."
2,Stomp Rocket,"I gave this to my three year old grandson. He had a bit of trouble figuring out the ""stomp"" action, but once he did - he loved it. I liked that simplicity of design and the success he was able to achieve right away. The rockets were well balanced and flew in straight lines. I liked the fact that you can adjust the trajectory from straight up or angled. Great fun for indoors or outdoors."
2,Should have bought this sooner!,"Excellent printer. I read other users' comments here before buying, and all the reviews were accurate. The photo quality is exceptional, the speed is noteworthy, and wow, is it quiet!Nice looking, extremely well made, easy to insert cartridges, and fairly compact. I am running Mac OS X 10.2.6 and setup was flawless.I switched from an 8 month old Epson 820 that was impossibly clogged and in need of replacement. Other users reported similar problems, and though Epson offered to replace it with a remanufactured one, I didn't want to go through the same problems again.Should have bought the i950 in the first place. It's a jewel."
1,Bad description,"I was not satisfied at all with the purchase. The book content is what was expected. The description of the status of the used book was way off. I ordered a book WITHOUT ANSWERS and there was no mention in the description of the book that the answers were written in. I emailed the seller multiple times with no answer to try to resolve the issue. I paid only $10 less than I owuld have for a brand new book, and had to white out most pages. Very frustrating."
2,They taste like my mom made them!,"I don't get to eat many cookies but when I do I want them to taste great. You just cannot beat cookies fresh out of the oven for the great taste and the aroma. This mix is nice as you quickly add butter, an egg and bake. In less than 20 minutes you have a nice sweet treat to share with family and friends.My grandson loves to come over and bake some cookies for dessert for dinner. Unfortunately many times they don't last long enough to make it to dinner time. Their life span is pretty short. There is just something about eating them while they are still warm that is just irresistible.Betty Crocker is a good name brand and one you can trust for the highest quality. You should buy some and treat the kids and yourself to something special!"
1,do not buy this product,I did not listen to the all reviews instead I bought this product. Now I have to throw away this garbage. It's a waste of money.
2,Now at last they were beginning Chapter One...,"This book is the last volume in the allegorical Chronicles of Narnia series. The last King of Narnia fights a hopeless battle against evil yet finds glory. He discovers that reality and Narnia itself are mere ""Shadow-Lands"" which only mimic a truer place. A beautiful and spiritual novel, it should always be read last in the sequence of Narnia stories."
2,Real good,"i think this cd is real good. it has everything. pop, rock, and even a little rap. it is a great cd and even though i didnt recognize a couple of names, i listened to the songs and loved them. i recomend this cd to anyone who enjoys listening to music!"
2,Action Packed Historical Romance!,"This is the finale of the Kiss trilogy. I truly enjoyed this series taking place in the mid 16th century. Queen Mary (the daughter of Henry VIII) and King Phillip rule during a very fanatical time. People are murder for little reason and Mary is quite serious about her catholicism. The problem is she cannot produce an heir. A plot is hatched to impregnate Lady Nielson (Pippa) with Phillip's heir, while she is drugged. Lionel Ashton is involved with King Phillip and is left to care for Pippa. . . . (violins) It is the perfect historical romance full of plenty of action. Entertaining and great character development. I would love to see a new series, perhaps with her stepbrother Robin and Louisa."
1,Don't Buy Unless You Love Spam E-mail,"I ordered two types of coffee from Cafe Britt. Although the coffee was good, I have been hammered with their never-ending email spam campaign. I've ""unsubscribed"" from their emails three separate times with no avail. Buy your coffee somewhere else unless you love being spam-targeted for the rest of your life!"
1,Didappointing,"Sorry this was a great disappointment... I felt that the picture was deceptive and that the crown its self did not in any way represent the crown our Savior wore. it was flimsy, small and put together in mass production style without any reverence for the meaning behind it. I am grateful amazon let me send it back."
1,Meandering and pretentious,The story had promise but I don't appreciate the author's deliberate obtuseness. There is too much literary pedantry and not enough substance to this book.
2,"Pay attention world, you have a rising star in your midst.","An awesome mix of sweet and sultry! Michelle has an innate ability to grab you with a confluence of haunting melody, guttural vocals, and teasing lyricsm. There is true emotion in this album, and it is done in such a way that it is not pretentious in any way. A top rate first album. ""He ain't no good"" exemplifies her ability to roll up her writing and performing talents into one song. Way to go, Michelle!"
2,J.Lovell's problem solved,"I know J.Lovell returned the card because of the message -""The device Ricoh R5C520 Carbus Adapter has detected a CardBus card in its slot, but the firmware on this system is not configured to allow the CardBus controller to be run in CardBus mode. The operating system will currently accept only 16-bit (R2) pc-cards on this controller.""We had the same problem and message from XP - it was caused by the BIOS of the host Gateway PC not being uptodate. After a flash update of the BIOS from Gateway the card worked OK. So I guess that was J.Lovell's problem as well.We solved it ourselves - Belkin responded to emails but did not have a solution."
2,Best Echinacea Tea,"There are a few good echinacea teas out there, but I believe this one to be the best. The tea bags are slightly larger which makes a stronger tea; and when I'm sick, I want the stronger dose."
1,"Lame, not funny","I thought this was going to be a book more about actual uses for turds. Turns out, this is just a comic book. It's nothing more than a bunch of ink drawings of silly uses for turds. Most of them impractical."
2,CONTAINS SOME OF THE BEST LYRICS I'VE EVER HEARD,"This album features 14 killer songs. There is not a ""B"" cut among them, and ""The Last Comanche Moom"" contains some of the best song lyrics I have ever heard. Only Kristofferson's ""Sunday Morning Sidewalk"" has ever ""pole-axed"" me with similarly powerful imagery. It is a complete novel in a song with no wasted words. Hats off to Mike Blakely. I hope that he has more in him, 'cause I'm fast wearing this one out."
1,PRINTER DIDN'T WORK - LACKED APPROPRIATE DRIVERS,"BEWARE - Box stated that printer would work with Windows 98. We have a network system that contains two windows 98 SE computers. The CD-ROMS in the box were only for Vista, 2000 and XP. I called HP and it could not make good on the blurb on its box stating that it would work for Windows 98."
2,"This book is better than ""Midwives"".","I am a little disconcerted about the similarities between ""Midwives"" and ""The Law of Similars"". Both deal with women in Vermont who practice non-traditional medicine and make mistakes that get them in hot water. The reasons that ""Similars"" is better is that 1) It has more humor. 2) It has a touching love story. 3) It depicts the love between a father and his young child poignantly. However, the case of the misguided homeopath is somewhat contrived and unrealistic. Nor do I believe that Fowler would have played fast and loose with the law the way he did. Bohjalian seems to be hung up on moral ambiguities in life. I have no problem with that per se, but he should stick a little closer to reality. However, in its favor, ""The Law of Similars"" is an engrossing and a fast read, with snappy dialogue and sharply delineated characters. It is a step up from ""Midwives,"" which was far too dark and depressing."
1,Hard Rock Suckage,"I saw these guys per chance during this tour. They played Horde for some unknown reason. With all the hype that surrounds these schlemiels, i can't get over the played out rock poses of Mr. stapp and the atrocious penchant for writing tunes that are only enjoyed by those who drink PBR in a smokey hick bar. Rev up your truck, grow your mullet and move to the sunny coast. I will give them two stars based on the fact that all of thier songs sound the same, but don't necessarily make my ears bleed."
1,Don't waste your $$$,"As an avid reader, this was one of the worst books I've ever read in my entire life. Besides Kimora ""barking"" at the reader throughout the whole book, there really isn't much else to it. She goes on and on and on about how she beats her husband at business....over....and over....and over again! This book truly sucks. Please keep your money in your pocket, or buy Justin Timberlake's cd instead. It's much more enjoyable than this book; hands down."
2,convenient,My main reason I bought this was for the separate nap setting which allows me to set the alarm during the day for a nap without changing the normal alarm settings I use in the morning. The display brightness is fine for me. I don't use the radio so I'm not a good judge of its quality.
2,A Student's Perspective,"This book was required reading for my Civil Rights class. Although at times a bit too detailed and tangent prone, Hemphill's style is very gripping and kept my attention. The way in which the formation and development of Birmingham is disussed, enterpreted, and explained is superb. Hemphill does an excellent job of juxtaposing the racial, economic, and social climate that evolved and gripped the city of Birmingham throughout the years. I would consider this autobiography of sorts a must read for any person interested in issues pertaining to the Civil Rights Movement. Just get through the few dry parts, the rest is well worth the read!"
1,mike myers worst of,"ok this i thought would be a good one but it was as good as the love guru and if you have seen that then if you have common sense you will not buy this item i have 22 best ofs and the molly shannon one was better if you are going to buy a best of buy chris farely, will ferrell or tv funhouse those are the funniest so far"
2,Fisher Price Jumperoo,The Jumperoo was a great product and has met all of my expectations. The price was right and it will be perfect for a 6 month old baby.
1,Quality does not compare to original chain,Does not seem to be made of the same quality as the chain that came with the Poulan I purchased. Need to sharpen it quite often after just cutting a few logs. Once sharpened it works OK again but all the wear and tear plus al the sharpening will result in a short life for this product. I made sure the tension was not too tight. Next time I will do a little more research a far as where the item was manufactured.
1,certainly not the best.,"The recordings are from Alan Lomax. The date on the CD says it was originally released in 1952.The quality of the recordings make it sound as if they were not remasteredThe songs are all acapella and the voices are rough.The tempo of the songs are slow, as they should be.Its authentic, but not very musical."
1,Adobe Premiere Pro CS3 does not work with JVC HDD file,"Just to let you know that I tried Adobe Premiere Pro CS3 with the JVC HDD version SD camcorder file, the video editing software does not recongnize the JVC MPEG2 file as valid format for editing. The new JVC camcorder came out earlier 2007 record 720x480 16:9 format MPEG2 file on HDD.Sony Vegas 8 Pro also have problem editing that kind of file, but the video editing software from Germany Nero has no problem working with the file."
1,Way too small!,"I thought this would be a great transitional diaper bag. I was mistaken. It is SMALL. There was barely any room in it. I had enough room for an outfit change, a couple diapers and some wipes. I had to squeeze a color book and a couple tiny toys in it to entertain my kiddo. I used it for a month before upgrading to a bag that I found on sale at Target. For the space that you get in this bag, you'd be better off carrying a reusuable grocery bag!"
1,tedious,"This movie was tedious and irritating. My husband and I almost turned it off, but waited until the boring end. The acting was top notch, with stellar performances, but the subject matter fizzled. It was like watching an extended snitty cat fight. The movie raises plenty of issues about the nature of politics and media for discussion. But it was difficult to endure. (Plot spoiler ahead) I could not understand how Hughes kept trusting the reporter who was destroying her. I also could not buy his excuse that he was just doing his job. A better title would have been aggravation."
1,Total Fluff and Completely Biased Book,"This book is a sham. I'm sorry, but how ANYONE can claim to know what went on in the home of their mother and step-father when they were NOT there, is beyond me. Jackie Daly is trying to make a buck, pure and simple. It is a shame that she was able to rope in such a fine writer as Tom Carter has proven to be. Her mother died after many, many years of pain, surgery, and emotional distress. The medication she was taking on a DAILY basis, was a necessity for her to be able to perform, which was as essential to Tammy as breathing. For a daughter to say that she loves her mother, and then dishonor her memory in this way, is cruel. Tammy Wynette lived a very hard life, full of many abuses. The woman is finally in heaven (where she belongs) and yet, her daughter will still not let her rest. Please do not buy this book. Save yourself some money and go buy the National Enquirer, you will get more truth there, I believe.A Tammy fan to the end,Misty"
1,Worst movie of the year. And that's when I'm being nice.,"Once again, Craven proves his worthlessness as a director. He's had, what, 400 movies? 3 good ones? Tops? This movie is so bad, you can't even make fun of it. It follows every stereotype of crappy horror movies ever made. This is not a horror movie. This is a badly made comedy. However, since it didn't mean to be funny, it's crappy. I also saw and hated Boogeyman. Boogeyman is Gone With the Wind compared to this piece of monkey feces. Don't waste 100 minutes of your life. There are better, more entertaining things to do - like watching paint dry, watching an episode of Days of our Lives 30 times in a row, or just sleeping."
1,A absolute discrace to hard music,"Heavy metal or hard rock what ever you would like to call it has seen many diferant faces. From blues rock muscisians like led zeplen and black sabbath that played around with a little distortion to the kings of rap/metal korn. While slayer is cool death metal is probabally the lowest of all metal. Every Canibal corpse cd has sick!!!! and disgusting art work and every song is about killing some one. A absolute discrace to hard music,"
2,works great,My old catalic went bad and needed another one to pass DEQ. The arrived in a timely manner and i was able to pass DEQ with this. Easy to install.
2,an open heart,"this is, by far, one of the most complete, thoughtful, honest, true works ever recorded. if you have feelings, you should listen."
2,Helpful,This book was absolutely amazing with helping me and my family learn about the different breeds of puppies and dogs out there. In fact it helped us so much that we will be welcoming a new member to our family in two week. So if you want to learn about a specific breed this book is for you.
2,Works great and easy set up,Works great with my wide screen tv and the quality is amazing!I recomend this great item.
1,Philadelphia DVD,"Sad, I bought it as a gift and it turned out to be a European version which would not work on their North American DVD player."
1,Region code restriction,I didn't realize that there's a region code restriction on it. So we're not able to watch up on our TV. Only works in China region system.
2,I enjoyed this book have others that are my favourites,This book keep you wanting to know what is going to happen next. I liked how Miss Whittier adjusted to. What happened to her.Mrs Del Rae Me love
1,Dull,Im not sure why this book received high ratings. It was meandering and disjointed. The characters were under developed and their motivations were vague - vague even for folks who enjoy classic literature and ancient human beliefs.
1,The Truth,Anything by Bill O'Reilly is an automatic piece of garbage. He isn't capable of writing (?) anything else. He is too self-centered to actually focus an another subject to produce a book.
2,great deal,this is a really good deal for those who liked the series. i am a huge fan of the zombie genre. i liked Weeks better than Days but for this price the combo is superb.
2,It's okay,"Beautiful piano, poor quality control. Baby loves it but one of the keys in the middle either gets stuck or wont make a sound when played. Other than that, it is good and my baby loves it. The pitch/tone is not perfect but I am not really expecting it to be for the price."
1,You can get these performances minus the applause,"To the best of my knowledge, Art Tatum only recorded ""Three Little Words"" once... it appears on THE STANDARD TRANSCRIPTIONS. I was excited to discover that he had apparently recorded it live as well, but having read previous reviews here, and noticing that the song titles mirrored those of THE STANDARD TRANSCRIPTIONS almost exactly, I decided to listen to the Real Audio extract of ""Three Little Words"" from this album. It is absolutely the same as performance as the one on THE STANDARD TRANSCRIPTIONS. Do yourself a favor -- buy THE STANDARD TRANSCRIPTIONS instead, and avoid the overdubbed applause."
2,Must read,This book is a must read for any woman that perpetually finds herself in horrible relationships with the same type of man over and over and over and over again. If you are tired of the B.S. - read this book. Trust me.
1,Do not waste your money!,"This movie was absolutely horrible! Even for a kids movie, it was unbearable. My children could't wait to see it since we missed it in the theatres. We didn't even finish it. They thought it was stupid, thank god because I couldn't take it anymore. Glad it only cost me a few bucks from home, I would have walked out of the theatre otherwise and been out a lot more money."
2,Every young person needs to read this book,"I am believe myself to be a well-informed young voter. I believe that anyone who writes a review downing the information needs to read the back of the book called the ""notes"" and go to the websites of the newspaper articles that they were taken from. This information is publically accessed. Also, searching on Google for the 911 timeline by Paul Thompson will help you out to make informed decisions, taken from newspapers and so on. I believe that most of us that have read this book have made up our minds about the issues in which we stand. This book, however, opens your eyes up to the bigger picture. I, for one, see this book as a learning tool and a tool in which to educate my fellow college students to go out and vote. Why should we go against our moral judgement? Why should we lie to ourselves and vote against our own best interests? Food for thought."
2,"Second set, still pleased","My wife and kids have been sharing a set for a year so I decided to get my son his own this Christmas. Both sets are holding up well, no noticeable wear. If you're in the market for this type of headphone (light, open, etc) you can't go wrong with these. Great sound. They do fold up but we've found that to be mostly a gimmick."
1,Inexcusable sound,"The ""remastering"" job for this wonderful record is an absolute joke. Distortion runs rampant throughout it, and the label should be offering replacements, or out and out refunds. Avoid this reissue at all costs, but one of the other versions. A crying shame, really."
1,The thing is huge. Too huge for a car. Put on your 18 wheeler!,I guess it is my fault for not checking the size.It is too huge to put on the back of my jetta.Go Jets!
1,Loved the pot but it wasn't very durable.,"I loved this pot. I made soups and roast in it weekly. It was my favorite pot to cook in. Then one day while I was cooking up some onions in butter to make a soup, the enamel along the bottom started peeling off. I've not had this pot for a whole year yet. It should have lasted a lot longer than it has and I'm very disappointed with the quality."
2,1915 A classic account of the true horrors of war,"Lyn MacDonald's book captures the true and complete horror of warfare in this book. Rich in detail and telling accounts by the men that fought in the savage and bloody battles in 1915. A must read for someone trying to understand the daily misery and destruction of a generation of brave men. By far, my favorite book in the series, but not to discount the others, each of which is a classic and should be read in sequence to grasp the fullness of the story of The Great War."
2,Fantastic!,I fixed the McDonald's Big Mac's and fries for my grandkids and they devoured them! This book is full of our favorite fast foods and they're easy as well as healthy! What could be better!
2,A wake up call or perhaps getting ready for a let down experience,"Graven Matters is a book of reflection and introspection. We have taken things so much forgranted and we should not. We have come to be a society of people who don't want to take care of the matters of death. Rarely do people want to talk about such things, but Graven Matters brings the things we need to know, up to the surface where we can deciminate the things we need to be aware of an plan for our after our own demise from this world. Well written and informative, it is a book that made me order two more copies to have on loan to friends and family. Thought provoking and enlightening, this is a keeper and a mind enriching book."
1,A promo video for present-day Donavur,"I bought four different missionary bio type videos to help me prepare to teach a class on the Pioneers of Missions. This was the only one that was not helpful. It is not primarily the story of Amy Carmichael. Most of the time is taken up with showing the present-day activities of Dohnavur Mission. I felt that I paid for a promo video of this mission instead of what it was supposed to be, the story of a great missionary pioneer."
1,'Love' appears more than necessary.,"I just finished this book, and as much as I liked the story, it dragged on too long, and was horribly predictable. It was not the brain candy many of us seek, built boring and common characters, and seemed to be repeating itself. As soon as you read the back, you already know that she's leaving the baby behind. And what ever happened when Maribeth left? I never found out. But with the predictability, I'd say she married that guy and had some kids. The book didn't really seem to be much about love, probably because the word showed up too many times. It's easy to read, not much thought required. Good for ages 10-16. Can be finished easily in a night."
2,good book,"The title is misleading and could have been more accurate. The book was somewhat wordy. However, it is a good introduction to the topic of women as soldiers throughout history, especially during the American Civil War. The best writing is the last couple chapters when the authors discuss their feelings on the role of women in society and specifically as soldiers."
1,Too Tight,"All of these puzzles were bent too tight, I bought another brand of the same exact puzzles and had no problems."
2,Scrooge,"I have been looking for this one with with Albert Finney in it and it wasn't on TV for a couple of years. I have enjoyed my movie several times this year already. Thank you for getting it to me so quickly, it made my holidays better."
1,not impressed yet,"I bought this heater today to supplement my main central electric heat because it got too cold in the house having a small baby. i plugged it in, cranked it on high for about an hour and it is still giving off the most awful smell ever. i thought it might go away after about 30 minutes, but it is still going. i had to take it out of the baby's room because i didnt want her to smell the nasty fumes. Needless to say, I am going to give it a little time because it seems to get pretty warm."
2,The New Floyd of our era!,"This album is up there with Dark Side of the Moon and Wish you were here. It is simply one of the best albums ever!Don't miss out!Also, their new album comes out on March 1st - FRANCES THE MUTEby...ViTo"
1,Save your money!,"Great price but very poor performance. The adjustment plates were too close to the blade resulting in only one thickness of cut--very very thin. The tomato test failed with squished vegtable all over the place. Harder veggies do better, but again only one thickness--super thin. I've trashed the plastic parts and now have an expensive stainless steel bowl. Nothing in ad indicated that this was made in China."
1,Didnt have the product,"Sorry guys - they dint have the product as advertised, or they couldnt find it. Either way it was a little disappointing and I wasnt in the mood for a bait and switch."
2,So far been happy with the purchace,"I have yet to push this unit to anywhere near what is able to do. I live in a apartment with my wife and young child. So max, even mid volume is out of the question. The sound is good and really adds to the movies that we watch at home."
1,Stopped working,I bought this for Christmas and it already stopped working. It was hardely used and was used by a careful daughter. She is very dissapointed DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"This is a waste of money. The plastic is way too thin to hold the weight of a small cat. Once your cat attempts to use this crackling, cheap, falling apart thing, you may never be able to talk him into climbing onto a toilet again. Hoping the seller is honest enough to give me a refund. CitiKitty makes a much better product and it isn't that much more expensive."
1,Not as advertised,"As stated before, this is not as described. It is only a card reader, period. Works OK, but not as slick as some others and the cord length can be an issue."
1,Bought from - fotrecords_,"""Bought Friends 40 Disc set. Said it was a NEW SEALED PACKAGE. I open the seal and removed the first disc to find scratches and finger prints. Then the next one was the same. All 40 had scratches and finger prints on them. This was repacked and sold as new. Also it had foreign writing on the box. Clearly not a U.S. product! No booklet in box. Refunded money promptly - I had to pay shipping back to them.""DO NOT BUY FROM - fotrecords_"
1,gaff product,this qcarbo16 does not work ...it is a gaff product for stoners who hope ... i used this product hoping beyond hope and was let go from my job because the products failure to perform as advertised... save your money ... i am certain the emplotees write the 5 star reviews ...if you take 5 minutes to check other reviews you will believe me..you may need the money for gas as you look for a differnt job... hope you are paying attention
2,Best Book I have read in months,"I read a great deal and am extrememly fond of tight writing, black humor and odd situations and this beautiful book exeeds expectations on many more levels than can be adequately described. Read and prepare to be swept away."
2,Pretty good book - something for everyone in the company,"The book is broken into two sections. The first section contains case studies. While the case studies are very old (some talk about compatabilty considerations with 1.0 browsers), they are still quite useful and entertaining.The second section goes into the business side of web development. I've adopted a development process from this book that works really well. But this isn't just for web developers. Your sales people can read it, so they understand how a web site can convey value to the customer. Everyone in the development team would benefit from an overview of this section.Clients looking for a professional web site should also check this book out, so they know what to expect (and what to ask for) from the numerous web developers that bid for doing their site...If you're looking for a professional site, you should pursue professional web developers"
1,A Lot Better than Last House on the Left,"Ok its better than last house on the left. What I dont understand is what movie did the other reviewers see ? Every scene that they described was not in the movie that I got. Any violence or anything that happens with the girls is off screen. Hello what am I missing. My version didnt have anything that was mentioned. Where were all the shocking scenes like the torture, rape and violence ? In that respect I feel really ripped off. The cover of the movie says its the most brutal movie ever filmed. Which movie was that because it wasnt the one in the case. I think I got sent only half the movie but the run time was 74 minutes. What happened to all the good scenes ? If a movie is going to advertise something then at least have it in the movie itself, duh."
1,"DOES NOT WORK, I AM A COMPUTER EXPERT. DEFECTIVE","This floppy does not work. Sometimes it will show up, but it does not read, format, or write floppys. While Amazon is great and will accept returns it is a huge waste of time."
1,I'm returning this book,I was very unhappy with the lack of detailed information in this book. I purchased this book thinking that there would be more information than a basic concept of some of the more advanced topics in Crystal but was dissapointed to find out that this book doesn't go into enough detail on the subjects I was interested in such as Web integration. I'm returning this book as a very dissapointed reader.
1,Test?,"Is this a test to see if people will still buy a book this bad? It's simply amazing that it was published, in hard cover no less. What a world!"
1,I suggest Cormac McCarthy first,"For a better version of this book, read ""Blood Meridian"" by Cormac McCarthy. The content of ""Rogue Blood"" was a large disappoint to me as I had enjoyed Blakes earlier books. Read them both and decide for yourself."
2,Classic comody series,"Fantastic seeing all the old series, it brings back wonderful memories of when I saw them all for the first time."
1,This Cube Is BAD!!!,"Knowing how to solve the 3x3 Rubik's cube i was excited for the challenge of the 4x4. I ordered a Rubik's and did not enjoy solving it because it was so bad. After watching a few legitimate reviews I decider to look at a new 4x4. I ordered a LanLan 4x4 and I have shunned my rubiks ever since. It cost half as much and was more then twice as good. The Rubiks turns horribly and locks up consistently. I can solve the lanlan twice as fast and I thoroughly hate the Rubik's. Do NOT BUY THIS for the same $20 you could get a LanLan or better yet a Eastsheen, Meffert, or Maru."
2,Ist read of Susan Lewis has made me now read 5 in months,"This book was the first I read of Susan's and it was a book I could not put down, that I found so real to life and just wanted to find out what happened. A very good wet day book. This story has prompted me to now be on my 5th story of Susan Lewis's in 5 months which is a record for me to read so much in such a short time... I highly recommend this author if you want a easy believable story to read."
2,I COULDN'T PUT THIS ONE DOWN!,This book is 500 pages long and I read it in 5 days. Putting the book down was impossible and I took it wherever I went. Even though the book is kind of a copy from LORD OF THE RINGS it still will get you hooked. I recommend this book for ages 11 to adult. Interesting turns are always happening to the characters. If you can live through the semi-boring first 40-50 pages you will love this book.
1,"Banal, hackneyed, and arrogant","It doesn't take an undergraduate degree in physics for us to predict the implications of the genetic revolution as set out in this book. For a much more cogent and beautifully written tract, I highly recommend Robert Pollack's Signs of Life: Exploring the Language and Meanings of DNA."
2,Awesome,Another reviewer summed it up best when he/she said that this player is the perfect DVD player to wait out the Blu-Ray/HD-DVD war.
2,Get this book.,"This book has the clear ring of authenticity.Durga Mata was the ""right hand woman"" of James J. Lynn (Rajasi Janakananda) and very much an ""inner circle"" assistant to Yogananda from the 1920s to the 1950s. (Yogananda died in 1952, and Rajasi passed on in 1955.)Durga was tough as nails, intensely practical, and cosmic, all at the same time. There is no hint of BS or deludedness in this book, IMHO. It cuts to the heart. You will get fantastic insight into Rajarsi Janakananda and Yogananda that is not available in SRF publications. At the risk of sidestepping Amazon, I will tell you that the book is available in its entirety, for free, online. I will leave it to the reader to find the link."
2,Fashion sketchbook: 1920-1960,"This is a great book for designers, painters and anyone that loves that era of fashion. I found it at the library and had to own it."
1,Review,Was incredibly disappointed to find out that the book was an abbreviated version of the text. That should be explicitly mentioned in the summary.
1,not so easily installed,"After purchasing a package with Firewall and 2003 Professional edition I tried installing them at home on XP and was pleased when Firewall was so simple but then distraught when Antivirus would no scan my email nor my system. I spent hours on tech support, uninstalling, reinstalling and trying to restore my system to an earlier date. I suspect that XP has something to do with it but who knows? Anyway when I was sent by the system failure message to the tech support site there were over 400 similiar problems. My solution to get another firewall and antivirus and start over. My system was clean and virus free before the installation and now I am at the library to use the web as I am reluctant to use it at home. Be careful what you get even if it does say it is compatable- maybe not so or [more] to get Norton's help to install- should not have to do that!!!"
1,Damned thing is right.,"This installment of the MOH series, I did not like at all. The story was interesting - I'll give it that (father ruins land for oil... then dies pretty gruesomely which is cool) and then his son is haunted by the memory of that night for 28 years... until the thing that killed his father comes back and ruins the town. I swear I've seen this before... or something like it.So... throughout the ENTIRE movie... you are waiting to see a picture, a glimse of the damned thing (I love saying that!)... and you get too... at the VERY end for 3 seconds and its bad, really, really bad!So my advice to you is... skip this one, if you are a fan of Hooper and want to take a chance, go ahead... just dont say that you were not warned.Oh yeah... Ted Raimi is in this one too... so, so performance. Liked him better as the comedic relief in spider-man... or as ""Henrietta - the evil cellar witch"" in Evil Dead II"
2,It almost convinced me to convert,"I love this book. I am a non-denominational charismatic born-again evangelical Christian. I was raised Catholic, and this book gave me some compelling insight into both my personal and religious heritage. This book, together with Scott Hahn's ""Rome Sweet Home"" almost convinced me to return to the Catholic Church. While I have instead remained Protestant, this book has inspired me to be become a bridge-builder to Historic Christianity, and has increased my understanding and admiration for Roman Catholicism."
1,Works fine for as long as it works,"I purchased this coffee grinder from Costco who replaced my first one no questions asked after it simply stopped working. Problem is, the second one has now stopped working as well. Push the button, nothing happens. Looks like another return to Costco."
2,"Pure, African, political","It's basic, pure music for all lovers of Africa hot choice. Very pleasant sound, but hard political poetry - it's rare chimurenga by king of this !"
1,Why was this even made?,"This is shockingly bad,yes its based on a true story but its already been done,2007 rise of the footsoldier,that is one of the best brit gangster films ever made,bonded by blood dont even come close,beats me why they bothered making this,cant believe the 5 star ratings are genuine,if they are i suggest you go watch rise of the footsoldier & then review this again."
2,Great Product,"This is a great product. This and sea salt are the only salts I use. Being on a low-sodium diet for life this little container last me several months. Pricier than normal table salt, but this salt is actually good for you! Full of minerals naturally produced on Earth. I highly recommend this product!"
2,Can't Wait to Get to Heaven,This book is absolutely fantastic. I love the well-developed characters and the narrator is a perfect fit. Fannie Flagg is a master story teller.
2,Excellent book,"This book was used as a textbook in one of my college classes through Regent University. The class, ""Contemporary Problems for Christian Leaders,"" was very enlightening. The book covers world views in general and Christian world views specifically. As a Christian, my world view was transformed by this book, not in an earth-shaking way, but in a subtle way. Instead of Christianity being separate from ""the world,"" I now see Christianity as redeeming the world. I would highly recommend this book."
1,Why don't Catholics have impeccably bound Bibles?,"Sure, they fixed the spelling errors and moved the notes to the same page. All of the glowing praise for this run of the mill Nelson produced bible just goes to show that Catholics have no appreciation for wrapping the Word of God in the finest materials. The nicest bibles in the world are bound by R.A Allen [...] and Cambridge Press. I have yet to find a Catholic bible that has a concordance. It is a good thing that Catholics do not reverence the Eucharist as they do bibles otherwise they would be celebrating the Mass with paper plates and Dixie cups rather than a gold chalice and paten, etc. To get a fine bible, you have to buy a Protestant bible, its a shame."
1,Interminable and Pointless,"""Lincoln"" was interminable and pointless, and I only finished it because I already had invested so much time in it. I think it blighted an entire June. I know all the history that people are praising Vidal for covering, but in my opinion nothing in this book makes that history come alive. If you want Civil War history read Gary Gallagher or one of the other talented contemporary Civil War historians."
2,Don't agree with the Amazon review on Dónde están...?,"The first time I listened ""Inevitable"" on Mtv I thought it was a great song, and ran to buy the cd. Ever since I've listened to it all the time. Then I bought Shakira's first "" famous"" album "" Piest Descalzos"" and got to the conclution that she has relly grown, as a singer, song writer, as a musician. ""Dónde están los Ladrones?"" presents a bigger variety on melodies, which "" Pies Descalzos"" didn't show at the time .Her lyrics are more mature, and with songs like "" ojos así"" Sakira proves her commitment with her roots and music.""Pies Descalzos"" (although I think it's pretty good) seems like a teen Shakira."" Dónde están los Ladrones?"" seems like a grow up Shakira."
2,Up in Smoke...?,"It is hard to believe that after looking for this release in DVD for so many years that every year I look I am disappointed that it is STILL not available. I, my wife and countless friends have quit smoking in the past couple years and this was one movie we all really wanted to see... it's a classic even if you're not suffering from withdrawl symptom... but if laughter is the best medicine this is the prescription you're looking for. A laugh riot sure to leave you smiling. Let's get this released U.A.!!!"
1,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews on Amazon, i went ahead and bought this book. This book's simplicity is misleading- the author' explanations are neither well thought out or well-written, concepts & basics remain unclear. The illustrations are a fright! Dark colors & unneccesary complexity amplifies the illegibility. I wouldve given it no stars at all, but, that' not an option.It's sad that certain Certifications prescribe this as an essential textbook. I hope there are better, basic books out there which explain network fundamentals. Note for beginners, if you have had no experience with networking, this is not a book for you. Internet searches/sources will explain the basics much better than this publication."
1,Junk!!!,This table is not high quality. Cheap at come unlevel i had to bend straight. I wounted put a drink on ot.
2,As expected,"Fast shipping, and a great gift for my child. Great for her age 13. Great quality product and the color that she wanted."
2,Just the cheese....,"Ouch --- Ouch..Call the Police, I killed these. They were full of flavor and have ordered more. I highly recommend them."
2,What really goes on...,It seems there are really colorful characters behind the beginning of those liquors brands which sit on everybodies shelf.Nice to know what people are really like versus the image put forth by PR.
2,MASTERPIECE OF A BAND!!EXCELLENT !!,"I must say that bands like these desserve alot more recognition here in the USA, This cd simply rocks, If you like nightwish, iced earth, sonata arctica, edguy- or even 80's rock, you'll fall for this one... The guy has that voice that brings back the 80's along with the great guitars and deep sounding drums, great melody, I think its worth every damn penny, take a chance and get it, if you like Metal youll like this cd it simply rocks!!"
1,"The Life Boring...Hook,Line, and Stinker >.<","Being a big fan of Angelica Houston, Bill Murray, and especially Owen Wilson, I was amazed that all 3 ended up in such a bad movie that wasn't even interesting enough to be called ridiculous. The movie description leads one to believe it is full of nonstop adventure and zany fun...but it is a chore to watch through to the end and when you get there you really don't like any of the characters. They stay at each other's throats through the interim, yet who can care when you hate each person equally? And...kidnapped by pirates....yeah right! if you choose to watch this movie you will see how anticlimactic *that* is! I have seen documentaries by Jaques Cousteau that classify as comedy much more than this sad waste of time and money ever could aspire to. Absolutely the worst movie I have seen in years."
1,Los grandes tambien se equivocan!!!,"Se espera y esperaba mas de estos 2 grandes cantantes ambos tienen mucha tela de donde cortar y honestamente con este material se han quedado muy pero muy cortos, debido a que la produccion tiene demasiados arreglos musicales los cuales opacan las voces de Ana Y Miguel al grado que se les escucha un tanto desafinados ya que la musica y los arreglos tienden a ser un tanto tecno y no popno lo recomiendo a nadie a menos que jamas hayan escuchado a Miguel y Ana, asi no notarian la gran diferencia y calidad de material editado por ellos antes. DECEPCIONANTE TRABAJO!."
2,Voyager 510,This unit is very comfortable and it has good clarity for the audio in the earpiece. I was pleasantly surprised how well I could hear while driving as other models did not work as well. I would recommend this item.
1,"Nice unit, but mine broke after less than a year","I really liked this unit when I purchased it. Especially with all of the different formats that it will read. However, in the last month or so, the unit has begun to freeze at random points on almost any DVD I use. The only way to ""un-freeze"" it is to literally unplug the unit. This usually occurs 30 minutes to an hour into the DVD. I originally though it may have to do with the heat generated by the unit and the rest of the A/V equipment, but even after I moved it out of the cabinet and into a well ventilated area, it still freezes. The unit did not seem warm to the touch either. I used to be a diehard JVC fan, but after this issue and issues I had with my JVC A/V receiver, I have switched to Onkyo and Sony. Good luck!"
1,hate the rugrats,"I Just haaaaaaaate the Rugrats!It's stipud,boring,and gross.I have no idea why alot of kids like this show and for you pepole over 20 who do I say get a job!Whats so great about it!All they do is site in they're crub, mispronounce words and sentences,say poopie,drop dippers,play pertend,and other dumb and gross stuff.There is also prombles between this show and the real world for insteens there is some pepole who watch this show and can't speak perfect english (eventhough I only know one I bet thery's more).Maybe becouse The Rugrats say stuff like I gots to go potty and another thing is younger kids might copy the gross habbits from this show such as going to the bathroom on trees and eat stuff they're not soposto to eat like bugs. If you don't agree with then too bad but you adment."
1,"""Destiny Fulfilled!""","This is the latest album from the best selling girl groups of the 90's titled ""Destiny's Child,"" and you can tell that something is missing from this album such as great vocals and the sassy beats and attitude from previous albums such as ""The Writings Of The Wall"" and ""Survivor."" Also, you can tell that Beyonce didn't really wanna come back to Destiny's Child and her voice lets us all know it. Also, you will notice how EACH member of the group will have a solo in EVERY song and Michelle just isn't cutting it. This is NOT really that good. I didn't buy it, I downloaded it thinking it would be good and then if it was, I'd buy it. No I will NOT buy it and I will DELETE it from my computer because it's taking up space where I can put something else on it!! Girl's give us a break!!"
2,Helped my son to read,"I had been given 2 of these books from a friend and I decided to see if there were anymore. My son loves this book. He's now working on reading the adult side. It's a great idea to have a page each, 1 for the adult and 1 for the child. We have several of these books now and I see my son sitting down and reading them on his own."
1,An utterly unfunny comedy,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Robbie Coltrane must have been desperate at this stage of his career.
2,More than just a pretty face,"Rolling Stone, Q and other music magazines constantly trumpet the great underrated artists of all time : the Velvet Underground, the MC5, Iggy & the Stooges, blah blah blah. Well there's one name missing from the critical pantheon, and that's Mrs. Miller. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've never heard Lou Reed sing with the passion that Mrs. Miller harnesses on her definitive version of the Petula Clark classic ""Downtown."" My one regret is that Mrs. Miller is already ""taken."" If she was Miss Miller or even Ms. Miller, there would be a line of worthy suitors around the block. And although I am very happily married I would be in that line. A combination of looks and talent this lethal comes along maybe once every 5,000 years. I'm sure my better half would understand. By the way, does anyone know if this is the same Mrs. Miller that used to sit in the audience of the Merv Griffin show every night?"
1,A Headache of a Vacuum,"The thing burned through belts. One time I replaced 2 belts in one vacuuming session--and yes I installed them properly and they weren't rubbing against anything.My guess is that it's the quality of the belts--or should I say lack of quality.Even after two years, the vacuum, when ran, would fill the house with a hot rubber smell.The tubes were also prone to clogging and I've had to pull it apart numerous times to push dust clogs through so it would work properly.After two years, the vacuum just stopped when the motor burned out. I did us a favor.The cord retractor was neat; at least they got that part right."
2,Beautiful,This ring is beautiful. I wanted the green one like it but I love this one. It looks better than the picture!
1,A Mottled Album of Life in Belken County,"This book was interesting in its style, but other than that it was muddled and hard to follow. The body of the book was merely vignettes of life in Belken County and the people that live there. I had a hard time concentrating on which character was who and who they were related to and why they were important. The style was an interesting one to read, but extremely hard to follow and left me wanting more of a plot, not just many small ones interlinked by the commonality that the people in these stories were all living in the same county."
2,Excellent book a must read!!!,"I for one am not a reader but, as I was looking over the site the other day this book caught my attention. I read this book in about 3 hours. I loved it. It pulled at your heart strings and your love for the characters grows as you read the book. I would definitely read this book again and I have recommended this book to everyone that will listen. Excellent book!!!!!!"
2,Entertaining and engaging,This entry into the Outlanders series was very entertaining with an engaging new character and new locales. Some of the on-going characters were relegated to the back seat but the book still held my interest all the way through
1,Prosaic readings,"The Chicago Symphony was one of the best orchestras under Solti. This prosaic reading of Saint-Saens Third Symphony is a testimony to Barenboim art. It does feel we're dealing with some university orchestra following an obscure academic conductor whose inspiration never reached further than ensuring the score is played and parents can hear their offspring play their line, but I could not have imagined that I was listening to an orchestra such as the CSO.If there is only one copy left as advertised, leave it!"
1,No drawings!,"I love love loved Edward Lear but unfortunately this free copy doesn't have the marvelous drawings. It would be better to get another edition of this wonderful book, one that is illustrated."
1,Awful... (Sorry),"I am sorry to say I disliked this book. The characters were not interesting, and nothing was very realistic. Take Alpin, for example; even the front cover of the book of a girl looking like a princess or queen - if Alpin was supposed to look like that, she looked like a b____, if you look closely enough, despite the beauty.Just a total, TOTAL disappointment this book was. Malcolm's father's book BORDER LORD was one of the best books I'd ever read so I had high hopes for this one."
1,Doesn't last,"Bought this with high expectations. Worked well for about 6 months, loved it. Then it stopped turning rendering it useless. Contacted the company and they sent out a warranty replacement which lasted about 3 months and stopped turning. It's a little expensive for such short term use.UPDATE: I forgot to mention, they charged me a $20 shipping fee because it was over 90 days."
1,Full of bugs,"I received continual ""script errors"" when trying to use help, making it nearly useless. I attempted the Quicken fixes, which did not work. I tried submitting my feedback that the fixes did not work and I got an error from their web site. It crashed once in the first few hours of use. Importing MS Money files is nearly impossible. Tech support costs 1.95 a minute. At least it has a 60 day money back guarantee.I guess I will continue to sell my sell the devil (MS) and continue to use MS Money."
1,"Very Disappointing--cheaply made, over-priced","Total junk, and what an inflated price! I expected something much stronger. This thing is so wobbly, even after bolting into the ground with the skinny little tent stakes (yeah, THEY'RE gonna hold it down in garden soil), you have to stabilize it manually while you reel up the hose. It only weighs about 10 pounds. Don't waste your money. Buy a plastic one with a heavy bottom (some you can fill with sand to keep them down). This is eye candy, but not practical and very cheaply made."
2,H:TLJ keeps on rolling,"After a nicely done first season, the second season is upon us. And in retrospect, Season Two is better than the first. From the first appearances of Autolycus, Jason, and Liddy Holloway as Alcmene (IMO, better than the first actress used); not one, count 'em, two sea serpents; the return of an old friend (sorry, villain) from ""Hercules and the Lost Kingdom"" and Lucy Lawless as Lyla from Season One; and an unforgettable homage to Ray Harryhausen.The only downsides: the series' first ""clip show,"" and the fact that the second season commerative coin is no longer included for free (mail-in card for it plus S&H). But all and all, a nicely done second season."
2,I'm With the Band,"Learned of this CD on XM Radio. I""m 64 and my favorite is Nancy Wilson. When I heard Tierney Sutton on the Jonathan Swartz program It blew my mind away! Old tunes that I've listened to for years had a new life. She and her band are quite remarkable and worth more than just a listen. Their passion for the music will make your heart soar!"
2,Good cup.,"Pro:- cute cup in bright colors. toddlers are into that kinda stuff.- handles are not only good for babies to grab on, but useful when hanging the cup on things, like the back of the stroller.- does not leak if installed properly. If it does usually it's because the straw is not pulled out all the way, so the rubber seal is not sealing up the straw hole.Con:- as with most straw cups, it's hard to clean. munchkin makes it as easy as it can be, you can clean the cup pretty well by taking it apart completely; however, the inside of the straw is still hard to get to."
2,"Finally, an easy to understand thorough resouce for woman with vaginal health issues","After 13 visits in 2 years to the Ob/Gyn and thinking I had yeast infections that couldn't be cured, this book was recommended to me by a PA OB/GYN friend. Wow, what a differnce this made. Well, needless to say I found out I don't have a problem with yeast and I was able to find a doctor to help me with a very solvable problem. Reading the V book educated me so that I knew what questions to ask and what information to have to help a doctor diagnose my problems. I also learned that my doctor did what many do, no culturing of yeast, but prescribe medication. I don't mean this to bash the doctor but rather to share how uninfrmed I was and how empowered I am now. The book is well written, easy to read and thorough. READ this book if you are a women stuggling with your own vaginal health issues. Give this book to any woman you love."
2,breadmachine gift,I brought this item as a gift. I picked the this product based on reviews and price and so far the person loves it.
1,UNABLE TO READ TIME DUE TO GREY BACKGROUND,"Very dissatisfied... illustration in ad shows a lighter background allowing a sharp contrast with the digital numbers. In fact, the background is very grey in color and it is difficult to read the time. I cannot read time unless I get in plenty of light. Background should be as illustrated allowing greater contrast.DO NOT RECOMMEND....vjmarsala@comcast.net"
1,Too Much Money + scripted battles = 2 rating,"I think this games really limits what you can do - it doesn't allow you to deviate from the script. at all. It's kind of ""arcade"" in that manner and I guess that's why I don't like it. It's too much money for what it provides. There's too much competition out there and money is too precious for me to give this game a higher rating, even with its graphics."
2,Must Have This LP,"i aint playin, if u do not have this LP, get it right now. most cd's u buy get borin real quick, not all though, not this. u can listen to this after 5 years and itll still be a classic cd. best get this cd."
1,Annoying Cabbie,"""Greatest Video Hits"" is cursed by a terribly annoying ""framing device"" wherein a nondescript New York cabbie drives around New York City and comes across various Blondie videos playing on bar TVs, TV inside limos etc. What's worse, this weak attempt to ""tie together"" the videos ends up cutting off 30 second chunks out of the beginning of several of the videos. Today, however there is a remedy, albeit an imperfect one. The CD of ""Blondie Greatest Hits: Sound & Vision"" includes a DVD which contains all but two of the videos on the ""Greatest Video Hits."" The two songs omitted are ""X Offender"" and ""(I'm Always Touched by your) Presence, Dear."" which are early gems off their first and second albums, respectively. ""Sound & Vision"" compensates by including the clever video for the equally clever ""Rapture Riders--Blondie vs. the Doors.""I give two stars, because this DVD is the only way to get the videos for ""X Offender"" and ""Presence, Dear,"" otherwise, get ""Sound & Vision"""
2,justice league done right finally,smallville is a very unique take on the legendary man of steel. but it is pretty much the same when it comes to using the two most popular icons in dc comics. use superman and batman to promote other dc comics charactors but in this show it works to a point. all i would say is that these last seasons of smallville have gotten justice league right and justice league was done right in thses last seasons of smallville. It is a shame that the animated series that calls itself justice league was not more like this. This show gets it right the way justice league should have been.
2,Great........but what about the other one?,"A couple of years ago, I saw the trailers for two shows about to premiere on ABC. Veritas: The Quest, and Miracles. I was more interested in Veritas, but I recorded Miracles as well. I loved both of them. Miracles is almost like Joss Whedon's Angel, kind of a film noir version of the supernatural--minus the humor. I am thrilled that it finally came to DVD, but now I must ask about Veritas. Veritas was also cancelled only because of the invasion of Iraq news casts going into primetime....as was Miracles. So, come on DVD producers, give us a release......"
2,Fabulous,"An incredible CD. Absolutely the quintessential Hardy. My favourites are Comment Te Dire Adieu, Les Madeleines and of course Ma Jeunesse Fout Le Camp, while Si Mi Caballero showcases her wonderful voice.I first heard her music when I was a little girl in the 1960's. Of course then I only heard the English versions (""Only you can do it"" and ""If we are only friends""). However, when Hardy sings in her native French, there is no comparison. Listen to the French versions of her music which are by far superior to the English. I recently ""rediscovered"" Francoise Hardy and bought a bunch of her cd's. I have not been able to listen to anything else since."
1,Did not work for me!!,"I tried to split the optical output from my H20 satalite receiver to power two audio sources. One output to a Bose 3-2-1 system and the second output to a surround amplifier to run powered sub and rear surround speakers. The Bose system worked good in either output socket, but my amplifier would not work in either socket. The amplifier works good with direct connection to H20 receiver. Going through this splitter weakens the signal that many audio components will not work. Waste of time & money trying. My next try will be a powered optical to coaxial converter and then split the coaxial signal."
1,future one-hit wonders,"I hate to be the guy that likes only the Big Radio Hit, but that seems to be the case here. Yeah, ""Bring Me to Life"" is a good tune -- textured, swelling, and rocking when it gets going. And, yeah, she's got a great voice. But the rest of the disc is sort of faux-gothy, lyrically lame, and plodding in that cliched, Linkin Park way. It may appeal to those under 20, but older, discriminating listeners won't find much here."
1,"Works on some bottles, but not on most.","Whether this foil foil cutter will work on any given wine bottle depends on the shape of the top of the bottle. I know, they're all round, haha, but some have more of a pronounced step about a quarter of an inch down from the bottle top than others. I've given up on this foil cutter and found that the two other ones I've tried have worked much better."
1,dogbone neck pillows,"Both of the neck pillows I recently bought have already needed hand-stitching repair, having come apart at the seam."
2,Heater,"I wanted a heater I could use at work that would not make alot of noise and attract a lot of attention. It is always so cold there. This heater did the trick, it was very quiet but produced plenty of heat. I would recommend this to anyone looking for that ""quiet"" heater with no blower noises!"
2,We die alone.,"Excellent story of survival i give it 5 stars. It is a true story which made it even better, great stuff, recomendit to anyone how likes non fiction!"
1,Good idea bad product,"The idea is good even beyond your imagination. Very easy to set up. You will have more fun if you set it up with internet.The major disappointment is that I find ONE dead red pixel on the monitor. Call Sony for the resolution and my answer is that the moniter is not defect base on their guide line. No exchange, however, I can send it back to repair on MY OWN COST (not cover by the 90 days warranty!!!!!!). They even say the price will be double up to make it 100% dead pixel free. And the statemnet inprinted on the owner menu, you can download it from Sony's website.This is very disappointed. A dead pixel on the monitor is defect. I can buy a 17"" LCD monitor with less money and 100% no dead pixel. If you plan to buy one of this. My advice is checking the monitor before you pick it up if you can. Good luck, because will cost you same amount as buy a new one."
1,The worst buying in Amazon,"I pre ordered this item, and was previously announced wihtin portuguese subtitles.I receiced the package last week, and form my surprise the BDs doesn't have the portuguese subtitles.And another bad surprise when I checked the item back at Amazon, to see these details, the product description announced was changed.Now here, in Brazil, is not possible to return the item, or to sell it aorund. The thing is stucked in my hands.Shame on Amazon, never saw this happening before."
1,Aaliyah : More Than a Woman,I was disapointed with this book the author gets off topic exsesivly i wouldnt reconmend this book it would be a wiser choice to go with Aaliyah: An R&B Princess in Words and Picturesor Aaliyah by Tim Footman
1,Some of the worst service I have ever experienced,I could only recommend this product and company to my worst enemies and then I would still feel guilty. Their idea of technical support is either $35 a phone call or a website that does not appear to work in any way shape or form. I feel sorry for anyone going to purchase this product and plan on returning my one unfortunate copy and my earliest possible moment.
2,One of the best portable DVD hardware decoders for low CPU utilization,"This card works well under Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000 and even XP! I used it with several notebook computers for output VCD, DVD or MPEG videos to TV. Since it's a hardware based decoder, the image quality and video performance is excellent. It reduces the CPU usage to about 5%! Compare that to the 60 to 95% CPU usage of a software-based DVD decoder like PowerDVD or WinDVD. Having the lower CPU usage allows me to work on other CPU-intensive applications at the same time while watching a movie. It is a great addition to any PC card enabled notebook computer."
1,Luvs,These diapers do not have enough flexibility and are too narrow. I also have to buy a size bigger than I would buy with Pampers Cruisers. The absorbency is good but that is the only thing I like- this was my first and last purchase of Luvs.
2,EXCELLENT LATINO BY PUTUMAYO,"Anything buy Putumayo is great. This is nothing different--great latino vibes for any party, morning errand or dinner mix."
1,No Change,"I have been using this product for a few weeks now. I have not noticed anything new. Still have slight breakage and no noticable growth. And yes, I am active, drinkin lots of wated and watching my diet ( since that seems to be advice that most get when the poduct isnt working) I will finish my bottle and just see if I notice anything by then. Not sayin its a good or bad product. Right now, I guess I'm still waiting for some results."
2,Really good!,"I read this book and found it very interesting and full of scientific easy facts. And above all, they are all connected with the world of comics and cartoons (super-heroes above all) that is a world that I follow since I was about 11 years all.Now I am a director and write and direct animated cartoon series, I have a background in Physics and for this reason I find this book one of the best I ever read.Thank you, very nice (and interesting) work!!"
1,A poser at best,"We all know that Swiss Cake Rolls will never achieve the delicious status enjoyed by Yodels, but I really do give them an A for effort. The major complaint with these snacks is that they are just too dry. They attempt to surround creme filling with some kind of chocolate cake, but the result comes off as a cheap tasting joke. I don't really have any advice for Little Debbie to improve this product, though. They should simply leave it up to the experts at Drake's Snack Foods."
2,Saturday Morning Cartoons,I wanted my grandchildren to experience an era where cartoons were fun to watch so I bought the Saturday Morning Cartoons:1970s Vol I. for them to watch the cartoons their parents watched when they were growing up. They were a hit!
2,Solidly Made Quality Adapter from Topeak,"I was looking for an angle adapter since I needed one to fit the tight space on a recumbent bicycle air shocks. I found one for half-price at a local bike shop - good deal! I tried it on the air shocks and discovered the anti-air-loss feature. Worked quite well! A solidly made fitting. Works great for tires, too! I've only used it with hand pumps, which usually work best for bike tires and air shocks. Had no problems. Seeing how well this little adapter works, I went back to that bike shop, while they still had some left, and bought an extra one and a few to give to friends! They really like it for their bikes, too! One caution: be sure not to over tighten the knurled fitting onto your valve stem to prevent crushing the little O-ring. A simple, yet fine quality product."
2,"Fantastic, of course","I am convinced that everything LA writes is fantastic. Great story, great characters, always great writing. I will continue to read every single item she publishes! Favorite author ever."
2,The Power of Positive Thinking,"This book changed my life. I use to have many depressing and negative thoughts. Always waiting on the bottom to fall out and it always did. I began reading this in 2006 and it transformed my life. This is an older book but the principals work for today. You will enjoy it and if you apply these principals to your life, you will be transformed. It is a must buy!"
1,disappointment,"What was useful wasn't new. And what little was new, wasn't useful. The majority of the book (80%), was devoted to subjects that were covered better in other real estate books. There was very little useful information on locating and buying real estate out of Probate.Don't waste your money."
2,The Vow,"Speaking from a stand point of a recovering brain paitient... I feel as though the book, was amazing. I could identify so much with this story.It really opened my eyes to see from the point of view of what my husband goes through as he is my care taker! Even if I can't help the things that I do or say at certain moments later I can go back and give him a hug and thank him for always being there. For being a rock through all of this. Thank you for the courage to share your story to help others!!!"
1,Musicians professional. Techs amateurish,Audio is poorly miked at times. Lighting frequently faults to blue red etc...Next time get a tech teams as straight ahead as this great jazz group.
2,Understanding Terrorists,"If you want to know what makes terrorists tick - this is a great read. By understanding Islam and portions of the Koran, one can understand how radical jihadists justify killing innocents. If you don't know anything about Islam the religion this is also a great resource. For example, I had no idea Islam came onto the scene well afer Judiasm and Christianity. Understanding this, it clearly appears to be a ""cut-n-paste religion"", borrowing heavily from each, and a blatant attempt to usurp each. Ergo - why you have muslims claiming Jerusalem as ""their"" holy city, the temple mount as ""their"" holiest site, Jesus was just a prophet, etc. etc. etc. Just a copycat religion - with servere overtones urging violence within their ""holiest text"" - leading to the violent behavior of some, and condoning / complacent behavior by the majority. Well written, cool and objective, and really just the facts."
2,Loved it,It's Harry Potter need I say more. I really love how the producers kept as close to the original book. I can't wait for the rest of the movies.
1,like throwing your money away?,"This thing was junk. It said I was ovulating when the bloodtest that were done by the OB said I was not, and then when I was ovulating and the blood test and test strips said I was it said I was not. The thing is a total waste of money! If you really want to know buy some of the test strips you pee on, they are much more reliable."
2,A fantastic DVD/CD!!,"I just recently ""discovered"" Ozomatli when they opened for Los Lonely Boys in Seattle. I had no idea what I was in for when the lights went down, but came away with one of the best stage shows that I have ever attended. They are one of the most energetic, enthusiastic, interesting and entertaining bands I have ever seen or heard. This recording captures every bit of their live magic. If you've ever seen them, this is a great way to relive the experience. If you never have, buy this set. You won't be disappointed."
2,I LOVED IT !!!,"This book gave me so much more than I expected. I had heard that it was good porn - and it is! But I never expected to find characters who I would admire so much and come to really care about.The story is well written, compelling and believable. I found myself getting involved with the story and the people in it in a way I've never experienced with any other books. And the best part is that there are three other books in the series, each continuing the story in its own way.I think Ms. Antoniou is a genius in this genre and I'm truly grateful to her for what I've learned about human nature from these stories. I hope she continues writing for a long, long time. I'll continue reading."
1,MSG,"packaged cheese - what a great idea. add monosodium glutamate, not so good. It's a shame they've gotta add MSG to cheese."
2,Psychedelic Fun,I thought this film was hypnotizing. It's basically two very sexy guys rubbing each other down to dance music and retro graphics. Glad I found it!
1,Pointless Rant,"You shall waste your time reading this partisan rant if:- you respect seriously a journalist from the Washington Times, owned by the foreign far right cult of Reverent Moon- Trust documents leaked by the Bush administration, with its legacy of forging (yellow cake from Niger, Colin Powell evidence to the UN and much more...)- want to listen to the rants of a panelist of Fox News, but then why not watch the original source of Propaganda?"
1,very hard to push,I just tried this vacuum for the first time. It does not glide smoothly on my rug and my arm became achy pushing it. It leaves funny track marks as well. I would not recommend it.
2,I found this to be AMAZING...,"I purchased this CD in the month of it's release...and I'm still listening to it. All of the songs are amazing, and I can honestly say that they never get boring at all. I suggest this to anyone who enjoys the work of a great artist!"
2,A Breath of Fresh Blues,Just finished listening to Edwin Holt's new release. It is a excellent combination of strong music and even stronger vocals. I can recommend this album to anyone who enjoys the Blues and everyone who enjoys great music.
2,Great music from a great band...,"I have always been a supporter of local music, and the Buzzhorn has all the great qualities of a local band. They are down-to-earth, fun loving guys, who relate with any fan. They are also very talented musicians. They rock any venue they perform in, and can always get the crowd pumped up. Why you ask? Because its not about money, fame, success. Sure, it comes along with it, but to the Buzzhorn, it is all about the music, and that is why the Buzzhorn is so enjoyable. Any fan of Led Zeppelin or Alice in Chains will like the Buzzhorn. If nothing, at least see them perform live. It's an experience you will not forget."
2,Time Saver!,"It really does work! I call it a true time saver because at the same time that the machine is reaming out the citrus fruit, the stirring bar does a good job of mixing the sugar/sweetner into the lemonade."
2,Not quite the best,I was looking for recipes that was easy and none complicated. To many of the recipes had ingredents that were not alway in your pantry. I also have the next Lorna J. Sass pressure cookers cook book. This book is very much the same as this one. But it has much of the alike recipes.
1,HORRIBLE DO NOT GET VISTA!!!,"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST OPERATING SYSTEM EVER CREATED!!! DO NOT GET VISTA FOR ANYTHING!! IT IS FULL OF GLITCHES. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE MICROSOFT ADS!! Your computer WILL freeze, it WILL crash, and be 10 times slower! Vista also leaves your computer completely open to viruses and spyware.The windows 95 was a better operating system. VISTA CONVINCED ME TO FINALLY GET A MAC, WHICH WAS BY FAR THE BEST COMPUTER BUYING DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE! The mac operating system is completely user friendly, fast, no crashes, and NO VIRUSES!!! It's just so better organized... and with no glitches to report yet. PLUS, IT'S READY TO USE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!!!DO NOT GET VISTA, GET A MAC!!!"
2,Great starting point to the wonders of Jane Austen's world.,"Visually pleasing and well-formatted, ""Jane Austen's World"" by Maggie Lane is a pleasure to peruse through or sit down to read. Although lacking the depth I had hoped for, Lane presents a sampler of each aspect of Georgian/Regency life and a brief synopsis of the Austen family and Jane's life. Complete with many screenshots from Austen film adaptations, ""Jane Austen's World"" is a illustrated guide to life in this period. This book also includes insider tid-bits on Jane Austen novels, as well as write ups on each book. This book contains a guide to film adaptations made as recently as 1997 and is very up-to-date in its information. Buy this book for a visually pleasing overview of the period and this author--- do not expect a depthy study of either."
2,The Pet,"The Pets' lead Actress Andrea Edmondson offers a very superb acting performance of a submissive woman. Frenchman Pierre Du Lat looks the role very much so, of a man of wealth and power as well. I never knew this type of slavery existed until now. I am familiar with Mr. D Stevens' (world wide) photojournalism work. I applaud Mr. Stevens' effort and commitment to bring his true story to life and share it with the world.Obviously, this movie will create an impact on the Global Slavery Trafficking market. We live in a world of heightened awareness on terrorism & priceless measures of security to combat it. It will be very interesting to see how the national security of our Government and our Allied Countries take a plan of action to ferret out and apprehend the slave trafficking Lords of this black global market. Regardless of all the pro/con reviews and The Pets' box return, in my book, The Pet deserves an academy award for its contribution to Humanitarianism!"
2,****,"I love Rachel Caine, I have read all of her Morganville Vampire books and loved them, so I decided to give her Weather Warden series a shot. I am not disappointed. The beginning was a bit slow and hard to get into, but I new the author and waited it out. It got so much better with every page. I love the romance in her books, how it is there, but the story isn't consumed by the romance. I love that I can't predict what is going to happen next and there is always stuff happening, but not too much. I like Joanne, she has personalty, alot of leading ladies dont."
1,Priced out of the market,"I am a new Kendle owner and intended to subscribe to the WSJ, but at $14.99/month, you have priced me out of that market. Nuf said!"
2,Hilarious! Ten Stars!,"Finding Nemo is the greatest Disney movie of all time. I reccomend buying it, because you'll keep on laughing, no matter how many times you watch it. Dory, one of the main characters, really makes Finding Nemo sparkle. She's witty, hilarious, and her short term memory loss makes her really something to laugh about. From reading all of the other high rated reviews, you probably already know what the movie is about, I'm just here to tell you how great it is."
2,This is what special ops is REALLY like,"Roger Burgraff is either the next Stuart Woods or a veteran of special ops himself. Deadly Promise is that authentic and convincing. International murder-for-hire and drug trafficking aren't just the stuff of thrillers. They're happening every day and Burgraff's special ops trained hero, Jeff Dane, is exactly the kind of individual recruited to stop the, Whatever Burgraff's background, Deadly promise is impossible to put down.Mike Rounds USMC"
2,"Very satisfied, great customer service.","The product was great, it turned out I ordered the wrong size so I also experienced great customer service in handling my return. I only wish is that there was not a 30% restocking fee deducted from my return, but I believe this practice is typical of a smaller company."
2,Prevents Chafing,I bought this at the last minute before a 70.3 distance race when I realized I was out and did not have time to go by local bike or swim shop to pick some up. It came on time and worked great. My only problem was forgetting to put some on the back of my neck under my wetsuit and I proceeded to get a large sore in that location. I hopefully won't do that again.
2,"Clear Structure, Good Vocab List","The vocabulary list contained in this book goes on for 90 pages, and contains about 2500 words. Since last month, I have taken the challenge to memorize them all. Everyday, I also took one of the 30 or so question sets (10 analogy, 10 fill-in, 10 reading). By now, I am 2/3 of the way finished. This contributed greatly to the increase of my verbal score to 750 (from 650) on the practice SAT test.Besides, I also have ""hot words for SAT 1"", and the Barron's guide. This is because one book does not offer enough practices. Getting a couple books is also advantagous because the varying teaching styles makes the task of memorization less monotonous."
2,PRINCESS AND THE KISS: A STORY OF GOD'S GIFT OF PURITY,I GIVE THIS TO GIRLS FROM 6 TO 16. IT'S A SWEET STORY OF KEEPING PURITY FOREMOST IN YOUR MIND AS A GIRL IN THIS AGE OF PROMISCUITY. IT IS ENDEARING AND I HAVE READ IT TO MY GRANDCHILDREN AND GIVEN MANY OF THESE BOOKS AS GIFTS.

1,DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO/DVD,"I was very disappointed with this instructional video. The background is pitch black and the male dancer wears black pants and shoes, so you can barely see what he is doing from the waist down, which is very important to see in order to learn. (Whole point of the video, no?) Each step is only done once or twice, so you'd have to rewind over and over until you get it. Don't buy it! It's a waste of money."
2,"Nice, easy projects for a beginner","I tried to learn shuttle tatting a few years ago, basically just watching videos and tangling strings on my own, I finally got a few stitches to flip, and put my shuttle down and didn't pick it back up until just recently. This time, with a little more patience, and some videos with a little better explanation, I got it, and decided this would be my starting point with pattern books, and I'm not disappointed in the least, it's a great little booklet, and I've been working on working each one of the projects at least once... twice if I really like them, or if there's something I don't get right away. The patterns in this book are balanced just right, not so hard as to be frustrating, and not so easy that I'll be stuck in a boring rut."
1,Cool!,"Dude this kicks! Really fast and loud, dissonant. I've never heard piano sound like this. And its really cheap too. WOW!BUT THERE IS NO UNDERSTANDING OF THE MUSIC. THESE WERE ALL GREAT COMPOSERS, AND THIS PIANIST TREATS THEM LIKE PEOPLE WHO JUST WROTE LOTS OF NOTES THAT WERE HARD TO PLAY. BUY POLLINI OR ASHKENAZY INSTEAD. THIS IS COOL BUT NOT WORTH TEH $7!"
2,Must have for beginning PFC-ers,"Unlike other books on the subject, this book leads you through - step by step building PFC applications. Very easy to read and to understand. Great for beginners."
2,A terrific follow-up to their last album.,"I loved Oasis' first US album, What's The Story Morning Glory?, and this was a wonderful follow-up. The music is crisp, fresh, and has catchy melodies that keep you listening. I love Oasis and I love this CD!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed in this product. Growing up with Care Bears, I was excited to introduce them to my 3 year old daughter. This toy, however, is not worth the money. You have to press really hard to get the figures to stay in the cars and then the cars don't even stay on the ferris wheel as it is spinning. The music is also very, very loud and choppy. Overall, a very annoying and overpriced toy."
2,Gets the job done,"This product works. I have only had it a few months, so I am not sure about its longevity, but it makes splitting wood easier than any other product I have used. I have never needed a wedge or another axe when splitting wood with the Fiskars axe. Not sure of all of the physics behind it, but it splits the wood with the least amount of effort so you can get more wood split."
1,A bad Movie,This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. All there was was boyz. I wanted a movie with boys. If you want to hook up with me my phone number is 762-6605
1,What's All the Fuss?,"kingsley Amis' established himself as a literary celebrity in England with the publication with this short work of comedy, which would continue to occupy a comfortable niche in the academic-farce 'genre' for the duration of the trend. Yet I found Lucky Jim terribly stiff and antiquated; it lacks any of the satirical wit that it must have possessed during time of its publication. We are asked to follow a fairly inept junior professor through a series of contrived situations at a major university amidst a cast of comic-book-esque academic types. I suspect that this brief whimsy will be an object of sociological curiosity rather than a highly regarded work of literature. Kingsley has the ability to reveal the absurdity of a given culture. He does not however, have the ability to make it pulsate with life and mystery the way his son can."
1,Feed them garbage and let them feast,"Without a doubt many may think this travesty to be akin to the ""genius"" of the Public Enemy/Anthrax abortion that spawned the excrement that was to become so-called ""nu-metal,rap metal,metal core, whatever, etc. I for one am not among them. If I could rank this drivel with a negative number I would, but I gave it a 1 star review simply for the 'marketeers', PR people, managers, and especially the vanity of the playas themselves who have the b*lls and the audacity to once again pander to the lowest common denominator of music fan and think that they'd suck-cede. When such obvious and cynically marketed product such as this sells even a single CD it just proves again that if you feed them only garbage the masses will gladly eat! Now choke on it gangstas..."
1,Robert Thurston has better BT novels available,"Freebirth, #4 in the Twilight of the Clans series, really seems to derail from the general plot of the series. There is very little combat in this book, and most of the book is spent on talking. My best suggestion is to skip this book and go straight from The Hunters to Sword and Fire. You won't miss much. I would have to say that this is the only BattleTech novel that I've read that I really didn't like. If you really want a Robert Thurston book, try I am Jade Falcon or the Legend of the Jade Pheonix Trilogy instead."
2,"Long time favorite, but not the complete version","I have been waiting and waiting for this to finally come out. I am thrilled to finally throw out the last of my VHS tapes as it was only sticking around for my Pirates tape, but if you were expecting the rare uncut version with Ruth's Act I pirate scene and Mabel' Sorry Her Lot, you will be disappointed, as I was. I really thought since they were finally putting this together they would make it worth their while and include the full version that is only available via CD with Estelle Parsons plaing Ruth. I guess I'm just annoyed they haven't released the complete version but otherwise still a favorite :)"
1,Very Poor,What a waste of a perfectly good CD. The entire CD consists of basically one song and 30 second snipits of music from different sceens of the movie. I loved the movie and hated the soundtrack.
2,"well researched, plausable suspect for Jack the Ripper",This book gives plausable evidence that James Maybrick is in fact Englands Jack the Ripper. I found the book well researched giving insight in to the time and places when the Ripper roamed. The only shortcoming was that the diaries owner(s) for the past 100 years was not nailed down. The Book was also written in a technical manner making it hard to focus on all the facts given. I find it interesting to note that if this is The Diary of Jack the Ripper why it wasnt a bigger story worldwide at the time of its release?
1,Too long and slow. This story could have been condensed into a 100 page short story.,"I read this book for a book club and it was very hard to get through. The author spends a lot of time describing minute details about everything leading me to believe I would eventually discover the point of all the descriptive writing, but nothing ever came of it. The storyline picks up half way through the book, but it's still just a silly story. Sounds like a chick flick movie that I'd rather see as a movie with a star studded cast. This long book was too slow for me and filled with insignificant details. Cute story, but not for a 400 page book."
2,"Wonderful story coupled with steamy, erotic scenes.","This book was hard to put down. The story was excellent, and the erotic scenes were just as good. Like all of Anne's books, this one was very tastefully done. Well worth it!"
2,WOW,"it took me 2 days to really sit down and listen this album. And I think Brandy gets better every album. It's different, but very sweet and the stuff. Congraduations, Brandy. U are now, in the ""Big Leagues""."
2,Excellent Collection to Inspire Writers,"A college creative writing teacher first introduced me to this book in 1997 and I have loved to visit it over years. Dunn writes in a way that is distinctly personal, humorous, sincere, and sometimes brutally honest. He is a gifted storyteller who is able to weave writing advice effortlessly in with his tales. I would recommend my ""favorite"" chapters, but feel like this is a book best discovered without someone else's prejudices. This book can be read straight through from cover to cover, or the reader can skip around and read based on a chapter heading that catches his/her interest. Pick up this book and you'll want to seek out the rest of Dunn's writing."
2,Great Service,"Awesom job. This was a gift for my dad. It arrived promptly, perfectly and made me seem like a star. Thanks for such great service."
2,Great for the classroom!,These are great bells for a classroom. I bought several sets to use with second graders for a Christmas sing-a-long and it turned out great. They loved them and were very proud to perform their song with the bells. Thank you!
2,Excellent,"This is a great book, one of the two best science books I read (the other is Willard's ""General Topology""). Shankar delivers the correct combination of mathematical rigor and physical intuition. Also, the book covers a great deal of material.Some specific suggestions, especially for someone new to QM:1) Pay special attention to Chapters 5 and 7. They are somewhat more difficult than the other chapters in the first part of the book, but are VERY important.2) One of the book's many advantages is that it's self-contained. But if you're looking for a complement, or rather a different approach, I suggest to also look at the Feynman Lecture Notes, Vol. 3."
2,Clear abd Practical,This is one of the best books on growing a church that I have ever read. It is rooted in Scripture and comes from the pen of a working pastor who cares deeply about the local church.
2,Please Take A Seat,"I'm not a cheapskate, but I needed new seatcovers for my BMW. I didn't want to spend a lot of money for sheepskin, and I wouldn't want dead animal skins on my seats anyway. So I wanted to get something affordable but good quality and classy. This is it. The price was right at $30, and the shipping good also $11 to way out here in Hawaii. The dark gray looks great in my interior, and they make my car look cleaner and newer. It's good quality for the price. Thanks Amazon! You're better than ebay."
1,not impressed,"I got the soft rubber picks for playing my ukulele and I did enjoy the sound that they produced. It sounds like playing with fingers because you get none of the clickity clacking of a pick on the strings. The problem I had with them is the way they disintegrate as you play. They are exactly like using a rubber eraser to strum, and they will coat your lovely instrument in sticky white flecks. It looks like the ukulele has a bad case of dandruff. After afew weeks all you are left with is a little rubber nub that is good for nothing. I switched to felt picks and have been much happier."
2,"Great learning toy, and fun too!!","We got this for our son just before he turned 3 and he really enjoyed it, though he didn't get it figured out for a while. He loved just carrying it around. He's now a little over 3 1/2 and he plays with it constantly, has all the activities figured out and it's really helping him with sounding out his letters, and even spelling words."
2,Love this iron!,"Used this curling iron for the first time yesterday and I have to say that I love it! I curl my hair often and until now I used a Conair Instant Heat curling iron. This iron is so much easier to use, and it really feels like it's smoothing your hair, not gripping or pulling. The 1 1/2 inch size is great too, especially for those with long hair. I didn't use any hairspray so the curls fell out over the course of the day, but my hair just looked like it had been blown dry really well."
2,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!,"This sanitizer is wonderful! I got it because I have four kids who were leaving their toothbrushes anywhere and everywhere in the bathroom. So many of them fell on the floor or other places and had to be replaced sooo many times. After a lot of internet searching, I decided on this product. I like that the toothbrushes hang down so no gunk collects like other sanitizers. I wall mounted my sanitizer and it is very sturdy. The adhesive is strong, and you can put two screws (included) in the wall mounter plate. You may want to keep the cord tied up short if you can, otherwise it drops on your sink. Also, make sure your kids are closing the door gently and not slamming it shut.Since we have been using this sanitizer, I feel much better about our toothbrushes. We haven't been sick and my kids actually put their toothbrushes back in it. Great product. Highly recommended."
2,Inspirational and beautiful,"I bought this CD after hearing the updated version of Amazing Grace, the title and theme song for the movie. WOW - I was so impressed that a classic hymn could be modernized without losing it's impace and simplicity. I had doubts about the rest of the songs, but was soooo wrong - happily!) All the songs on this CD are beautiful - classic hymns, updated beautifully. Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful."
2,Another hit from the ATL,"After I heard the single 'Roll Wit Me' on the radio I knew I had to buy this album. I wasn't disappointed. 'Anywhere' is a nice, mid-tempo song with lyrics that are flirty-sweet but not cheesy. 'Roll Wit Me' is mellow with a smooth background. 'Sumthin on U' is another one of my favorites- it's up beat and has catchy lyrics. Other highlights are 'Made 4 Me', 'Fantastic Fantasy', 'Just Between Us', and 'My Place', although the entire album is well produced. It's unfortunate that Co-Ed didn't get the publicity they deserved, I would love to hear another album from them since they can actually sing! The only shortcoming is that the first half of the album consists of more upbeat songs, and the second half is mostly ballads, with a couple exceptions. I still strongly recommend that you buy this album."
1,This song.....Whatever,"This song is terrible, it's one minute and a half of repetition. How it has got 5 stars from the toehr people I don't know. Do not buy this."
1,first half was great,"the first half of this movie was really great, i wont bother to metion all the memorable scenes it has. but the last half was just pure trash, payne who was such a character throughout the first half just plane ran out of material. and the movie also seemed to shift gears from a comedy to some sort of feel-good adolescent drama near the end. truefully i really loved the first half, but that last half was just so bad it totally ruined a movie with so much potential."
2,Good watch,Watch is quite good. Only problem is its big dial which I think is not much suitable for a person with small wrist.
2,It is an excelent album,"I saw these guys in Puerto Vallerta, and they rocked the house. I really enjoy their music, its good old rock and roll. I now own radiate and listen to it frequently"
2,Season 2 on BBC in January 2012,"These will begin to air on the BBC Starting January 1, 2012. The previews are already available, Icanhazcheezburger has a them on the science fiction site."
2,Twister is about characters.,"Sure most of the relationships and characters are one dimensional, but they're still loads of fun. Sure you know what's coming, but it looks really amazing when it gets there.Twister is an action movie with a little romance and comedy thrown in, but it's really the relationship between the main two characters and the fun dialogue between all that make you want to watch this over and over again.As for realism, who cares, it's an action movie. But to be fair as unbelievable as most of this looks tornados really can do most of the things that are seen.Overall, a fun ride."
1,A SWING AND A MISS!!!!,"Despite their good intentions-----or possibly the record co.'s marketing strategy at the time, this record IS as bad as you may have heard it was. Both of these guys have done worthy work over the course of their careers but this is not some of it. They had a stellar cast of session musicians -and Jerry Garcia said of them and this record,""They could be as good as the Beatles"" Well, Jerry played on this record but these guys gained nothing from the experience. A truely embarrassing piece of work from an era noted for embarrassments."
2,Awesome moisturizer,I like that this doesn't smell. It's not perfumed. One pump is enough for my whole face. I actually had someone at work ask what I was doing different because my skin looked so good.
2,Couldn't put down,I could not put this book down. It had me addicted from the first chapter. It is an emotional book that makes you want to scream and yell at the characters in the story especially the parents. I became attached to Carrie's character so much that immediately after finishing this book I purchased the next book What Happened to My Sister. I recommend reading this book.
1,A deception,I tried hard; very hard but unfortunately I couldn't finish this book.The author is boring and pretentious.Zero star.
2,a startingly original page turner,Bernard Werber's book makes you aware that you don't have to look up to the stars to find a world beyond your wildest dreams. The hero of the story is an ant colony- and you just get involved into interaction of this totally alien world and the humans. The story is fiction- but many of the underlying facts that seem unbelievable are true. I could not put the book down- and it was an incentive to read more nonfiction books on insects. Very original.
2,"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies is a captivating book by an evolutionary biologist, trying to shed light on why certain civilizations fared better than others. The structure of the book has a scientific flavor about it, is explicitly biased towards geographical determinism, but far from providing peremptory arguments on the subject. The examples are thoroughly expanded with a lot of detailed information, inspired by diverse civilizations painted in different times. The reader clearly feels that the book is the result of in depth research."
1,Beware - This bleaches fabric!,"This product's warning label has the following buried about 3/4 of the way in - ""may bleach hair or dyed fabrics"" - this turns out to be quite an understatement. After all of my bathroom towels, sheets, and pillowcases started showing bleach stains, I started going through various bathroom products trying to figure out what was going on. Zapzyt was the culprit. Just dab a bit of this stuff on any fabric, wait a few hours, and it will be white.If you use this stuff at night before going to sleep, you may want to rinse it off before climbing in bed. =]"
1,Bad Measures,"I tried to review these at Macy's where I bought them from after following a link here but they don't allow bad reviews on their site. If it's bad - they time you out and won't let it post. Since I started here I'll review here. I didn't get a chance to check the handle issue. I checked them for accuracy because the 1 cup just didn't look quite right. I was correct. It is off in measure nearly 1/8 of a cup! I checked it against Pyrex, Pampered Chef and another OXO measuring cup. All measured true to each other but were way short of 1 cup when dumping from this cup into them. I measured liquid and I measured dry to check it out. Sorry guys - these are heading back to the store immediately."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I almost always love Brit mysteries, but I guess I got spoiled on ""Morse"" and ""Lewis"" and ""Peter Whimsey."" I could not get ""into"" Inspector Alleyn Mysteries though I really tried. For me, he has very little personality, intensity and pizazz as do the others I mentioned. I am definitely in the minority I know, but just had to mention how disappointed I am with this series. O well -"
1,Slow torture,"This book is by no stretch of the imagination good at what it aims to do...teach accounting. The explanations are lengthy and tend not to explain the concept fully. I have taken previous accounting courses and this text is laughably horrible.Not only that, but the problems at the end of the chapter are absolutely horrendous. These problems are poorly worded and require further explanation from the professor (who sometimes has no clue himself).This book does nothing to prepare me for a future in financial analysis.All in all, I would only recommend this book if a person really wanted to find a reason to commit suicide or simply die of boredom."
1,Too Much Noise,"I have now listened to this disc on various players. Obviously the material and the pianist are great, but unfortunately there was a problem in the recording process and this was not cleaned up via a suppressor in the transfer process. As a result there is too much noise, primarily background air, On this disc."
1,HP printer surprise - no ink,"The package has the black ink cartridge not included. Sort of a trick which I don't care for. Otherwise, the printer in OK."
1,Save your money and time,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen...or tried to see. It was so boring, I was asleep after 30 minutes. The next night, I tried to watch it again, but turned it off after 15 minutes. If you have insomnia, this movie is the cure."
1,Don't buy,The company charges more for these Culligan D-250A filtersbut ships the cheeper non Culligan brand filters.So u may as well just buy the cheeper non Culligan brand filter.In fact after this experience I am not sure I would trust anything on Amazon again.especially since both filters are listed by the same company on Amazon ... so its a bait and switch.
1,an MP3 player with a life of only 3 months,"got my FL100 256 mb last December 2003 from J&R tru Amazon, installation is quite a breeze, I was quite happy with it at first - then last night - arrrg, I added 1 new song to my list and it froze, had to disconnect and connect the usb inorder for it to unfreeze - next was able to add the song and while transferring some song in order - it froze again!! Then it displayed error, so I had to reformat the internal memory - and now the power will not turn on - IT IS DEAD!! Whatever happened Digitalway??? I'll get an IPod next time!!"
1,THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH IT,"this book is not worth it.. the pictures are not really good, not interesting, and by the 5th page you are bored already.. I find no good reason to buy this book as I find the photographers work to be mediocre, leaning to poor work...I am sorry but If you are intersted in photography I would seriously recommend the work of Bravo or other more artistic photographers.."
1,Didn't last. But worked will for a few days.,"Low settings on the heater burned out after only a couple days of use. When it worked it was convenient, but the low setting burned out and the high was too hot."
1,i just don't get the synth,"what inspired rush to abandon their old sound for this? i mean sure the music is technically amazing but in my opinion it just isn't very interesting and is just following what almost every other prog. rock band did in the 80's, turn up the synth and turn down the creativity."
2,Yes album,"Excellent sound quality for a reasonable price. A classic album that I wish was available in DVD audio or SACD, but I guess this is the next best option."
2,Great for travel,"Purchased this watch to wear when I visted Asian countries. I wanted a reliable, inexpensive, light-weight and easy to read watch (nightglo great). A very good watch at a the right price."
2,Good Book!,"This book is an easy read and has lots of common sense advice on how to become a millionaire for the average joe. The only downside I see in this book is trying to count on an average 10% return on the stock market. I don't see that as realistic. But otherwise, an excellent book with great ideas that are easy to implement. - Aimee Elizabeth, Author of Poverty Sucks! How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire."
2,Fantastic,Tried this product twice. It's a great fryer. Would tell everyone to buy one. The DeLonghi D14522DZ is the best I have ever used. Cleans easily.
1,Don't install ground sleeve!,The ground sleeve does not hold the pole secure. We poured 800lb of cement for the base but the pole wiggles in the sleeve because the plastic sleeve does not hold the pole in a secure fashion. We are going to have to fill in the gap between the pole and the sleeve with liquid nails to try and secure the pole. If you get this be to directly insert the pole into the cement - skip the sleeve. The ground sleeve is terrible.
2,"Stunning entertainment exceeded only by ""Traffic""","The 13 episodes of the first season in this terrific 4 disc DVD set provide stunning entertainment. ""Traffic"" is the only recent movie which exceeds this series in ""reach out and grab you"" entertainment appeal; no other recent movie comes close. I savored these episodes, limiting my viewing to one per night.Tony Soprano's mother is a character so fully realized and memorable she will forever be a reference point for future movie mothers. The quality of writing in this series is exceptional. The only episode which disappointed even a little was #10 and that served to bring home the uniformly high quality of the other episodes. Extraordinary. Highest possible recommendation. I cannot wait until the second season episodes appear on DVD as well."
2,Neat folded edges every time.,"This blade fits my old 12"" Fiskars paper trimmer. It's terrific! Now I can make homemade cards that look store bought. It's easy to use and gives a neat folded edge."
1,Wait for a Remaster,"The Mac's most underrated album is still a pleasure to listen to nineteen years later; in fact the songs actually sound less dated and more contemporary than the Rumours-era stuff, aside from ""Gypsy,"" which was on the radio constantly during the early/mid eighties (and is still a sublime piece of work). The problem is that the audio quality on this CD is atrocious--low fidelity, tape hiss, etc. One would do better to get an original vinyl copy, which, believe it or not, is a vast improvement over the transfer that was done here. Let's hope Warner Bros. gets around to restoring this one soon..."
2,Replacement,This was a replacement as the original hadbeen broken since it had been used so oftenand so much.
2,Amazon verified purchase,Love my router. This is the second one for me. Same brand only the other one wasn't variable speed. The variable speed it real nice. I do a lot of wood working and depend on good tools to get a professional product and Porter-Cable Router proves itself again.
1,OUCH!,"This one's a total waste of time. Sorry guys, don't bother - even as infant books go this is bad."
1,Zoe Bell gets 5 stars,"The only thing approaching entertainment and excitment in this film is Zoe Bell. When she is on the hood of that car, I couldn't take my eyes off the action. The rest of the film is boring endless chick talk."
2,TripleHead2Go Work with Windows 7 using Vista 64 sp2 Driver,"I bought the TripleHead2Go a couple of months ago and then purchased a Windows7 laptop. I was surprised to get a email response from Matrox that they would not be supplying a Windows7 driver for the TripleHead2Go analog edition. I then read where someone used the Vista 64 driver with Windows7 setting the compatability mode to Windows Vista SP2. I tried this and it works like a champ using 3 Samsung 24"" monitors giving 1280 x 1024 resolution. Maybe this will help someone else. All in all - still pleased with the TripleHead2Go analog.5/31/2010 Update - Matrox now has Windows 7 Drivers - Way To Go Matrox!"
1,unaffected by this product,"Bought from Amazon, I had high hopes for this product after seeking it for many years. Sorry to say though it had unnoticeable or no effect at all."
1,Stuck!,"I have been using this pan for a couple of weeks now, with mixed results. Brownie bites have been sticking a bit, even if sprayed with Bakers' Secret, but I had better luck with pecan tassies. Unfortunately, today I decided to try mini frittatas. Even after oiling the pan generously, the frittatas stuck so firmly that the pan has been soaking for 4 hours now and the thin egg crusts are still attached and even resist scraping with a spoon.Definitely not worth the hassle. I will have to search for a different pan."
1,Really horrible writing,"Sara Douglass has a somewhat interesting plot here, but her terrible writing makes it almost impossible to follow. While there's been a slight improvement since the horrific Wayfarer Redemption, in which points of view changed within the same paragraphs, the clunking prose and the simpering dialog is still abundant, and the constant taint of amateurish style is never far away.Perhaps it would behoove Ms. Douglass to find a collaborator with whom to write. She could provide her insight and plot ideas, based on whatever scholarship she has attained, to a genuine wordsmith. Maybe then the work would be readable."
1,Shouldn't a CARS game be about racing?,"I purchased this game for my CARS-obsessed 3-year-old son. However, I am very disappointed in it. Instead of being a racing game, it is a game that requires the player to solve ""puzzles"" and perform certain tasks. The only racing aspect of the game that we have been able to unlock is where Lightning McQueen races Chick Hicks (very boring when it is done over and over) and although this entertains my son the first 3-4 times, he becomes very bored with it. The other tasks on the game are okay but get quite boring too. However, we have since purchased CARS Mater-National and HE LOVES IT! Needless to say, this one hasn't been touched since we purchased Mater-National."
1,Avoid this one,"The last Marshall Crenshaw album of the '90s is as nondescript as its title. What happened? After a rock-solid Razor & Tie debut with ""Miracle of Science"" that was as encouraging as could be, Crenshaw produces this mediocre effort. It's as if he decided he was tired of being tuneful. Some noodling, some instrumentals that don't really go anywhere, and few memorable tunes to hang onto. I suppose he was trying something new, which is commendable, but think it through first and come up with strong songs and I'll follow you anywhere, buddy. Not this, though; this went to my local used CD store."
2,Best Tull album ever!!!,"This is probably my favorite Tull album. Another fantastic mix of acoustic folk music sounds and hard rock. My favorite songs here are Moths, The Mouse Police Never Sleep, and the title track."
2,Highly Visible Vest,This vest is highly visible and can be adjusted to fit over my backpack. The blinking LED lights are an added measure of safety. The On/Off switch is somewhat difficult to find and activate. All-in-all a great vest at a great price.
2,Dad digs it!,"I bought this for my dad and he loves it.Not my cup of tea at all, however if he's happy I'm happy!"
2,"""Not For Climbing""","It says right on it ""Not For Climbing"". Its for holding things on your harness or in your purse. It serves that purpose fine, but don't use it for climbing or other stress-weighting activities"
2,Great looking wine rack,"I needed a bamboo-looking wine rack for my kitchen countertop to match all the other bamboo items I have in my kitchen area. This was one of the inexpensive ones that had good ratings, and it does not dissapoint. I have 6 bottles of wine on it and it feels sturdy. I don't think I would want to put the two bottles on the top row sides. Also, this is great because it has an Eastern theme just like its materials!"
1,save your money for a better set,"My husband and I registered for these (at a department store) and now wish we hadn't. The serrated blades make it impossible to slice cleanly through anything, and the blade is too aligned with the handle making it hard to get a good grip. Our old knives are getting more use than these. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone who does even a moderate amount of cooking."
1,Battery Life,"This is a great little vacuum, but the battery life of less than 5 minutes needs to be fixed - perhaps wih a bit larger battery."
1,DO NOT BUY!,This item drains your batteries really fast because it needs so much power to light up the screen stay away from it!
2,The 6 yr old and the 29 year old love it!,"I bought this toy for my sister's boyfriend's six year old ( yeah, I know)- both males loved it- a big hit! The little one cannot manipulate the limbs, etc. without help from an adult, but no one seems to mind because the cool factor of this toy is so high!"
2,This Hitchcock classic isn't for the birds,"I had viewed this film for a class I was taking in college, with no real intention of paying too much attention except for the music (it was a music in film class). Surprisingly I enjoyed this film immensly! The only other Hitchcock film I had seen is 'The Birds', which I enjoyed but I found it kind of predictable. However, 'North by Northwest' is constantly turning you in different directions so you don't really know what to expect next. I havn't bought this DVD yet, but it will soon be added to my collection."
1,poor choice,I bought a pro diver by Invicta and had it for two years. I wore it only as a dress watch. It stopped working and was told it would cost more to repair it than I paid for the watch. Now have an expensive paperweight.
2,Got a replacement fairly fast,The first one I got was obviously used...but I got a replacement pretty quickly.Thanks for the fast service
2,Enhances The Movie Experience As Well As Self-Exploration,"I thought E-Motion Picture Magic was very straightforward and explained well. My movie watching experience has been enhanced tremendously thanks to the teaching in this book. Near the end of the book I had this urge to run and start a movie group.I was very happy that Dr. Wolz did the detailed exercise using a movie I had actually seen. It helped me to follow the exercise better and experience the benefits. The movie index at the back of the book is very useful, especially if you are looking for movies that address specific issues you wish to explore."
2,"Sophmore offering good, but great","I've seen Nichole in concert three times, and I adore her perspective. A liberal, accepting of all, type Christian, her music is mature and refreshing. Her second offering to me, seems a bit rushed. Wide Eyed seems more of a lifetime of delicate, intricate thoughtfulness about the words and music. Each track on Wide Eyed, serves an excellent place in the whole of the CD. Not so with This Mystery. This Mystery, Fool for You, Small Enough, Every Season, and Please Come are in true Nichole fashion. Everything else, though not horrible, feels overproduced and like a filler for the CD. I hope for her upcoming CD, due out in Fall 2002, she maintains the integrity of her gritty, yet delicate sound. Of course, vocally-I could use a bit more vibrato...She's a great person and great in concert. She holds a Bachelor's in Psychology and this is one of the reasons she writes the way she does."
1,Apt Title,"This is a truly horrible book. Every single image in the story is ugly, cruel, disgusting, depressing. There is not one socially redeeming element. The greatest horror is placing us in the mind of a child who was unable to escape the degradation of her life. I cannot figure out what humor some people claim to have found here. A dreadful excuse for a story."
1,haunted,A boring and uninteresting book I managed to plow through to page 105 then just could not take any more. Possibly without the teenage daughter it might have had a chance.If there was a zero on rating it would have got my vote.
1,Classic example of materialism and talentless trash,"Its funny. He ""raps"" about money, girls, cars, drugs..etcand it SELLS!! Yes, it does sell. 50 Cent admitted that his own music sucks, but it sells.yes, thank you MTV supporting kids of america... you made yet another talentless crook into a billionaire.I laughed at you kids when you bought hanson, spice girls, britney spears, limp bizkit...becuase in a few years you'll hate yourself for it =)"
1,Bleh,Obviously the people who gave this five stars have never used an Ipod or iTunes. The software for this devcie is clunky at best. The controls are terrible. The screen is murky and the entire device is cheap and plasticky feeling and looking. Is this really the best iRiver can do?
2,YES!,"After reading Stieg Larson's Millenium series I was stuck hoping for a lawsuit to sort out when the next book was going to rock my world from Sweden. Then along came Henning Mankell and Detective Wallander. The series is top notch story telling. Simple, beautiful and absolutely engaging. Have been reading these in order and love them. Also, have checked out the BBC series and have been impressed with the showa. A+ !"
1,"Damaged, Dirty Products","When I received the items I ordered it was obvious they had been stepped on. Dusty/dirty shoe prints were visible. Both mats were bent, leaving a visible crease. The corners were bent to the point of looking rounded. I cannot use these mats for the reason I purchased them as I will not mount photos in mats that are dirty and bent. Since it cost more for shipping then what I paid for the actual items, it was more cost effective for me to throw them away then ship them back for a refund. What a waste of time and money!"
1,Works great but...,If you have an external grip that extends your battery life already attached to your PSP this will not work with it. So its either this and without your external battery and grip or your external battery and grip with internal speakers/head phones. Other then that nice sound but because it does not work with my external battery grip I never use it. I'd rather have the extra battery power.
2,Biased View of Mormons,"Being a Mormon, I enjoyed the facts listed in the book but did not appreciate the biased comments by the author which to me left a sour taste in my mouth regarding the leaders of the Mormon culture. I'm sure there are other books listing the facts of the Mormon journey without the negative feedback."
2,2 yr old loved it,"I wanted something to help my daughter with her colors and her shapes. Since she loved Barney, I knew that this would be perfect...and I was right.She asks me to read it for her every night, and read again. Now she has memorized parts and pretends to read it to me.It has really helped us with the shapes because it uses name association like Sidney the Square.I recommend this book for parents who want to incorporate active learning with reading time."
2,a must for Zappa fans,"A great group of musicians. Dedicated to Zappa's compositions. Ernie Watts solo on How Would You Like To Have A Head Like This, inspired me to play the sax. Quality musicianship throughout, this will not disappoint."
2,Becoming a star on her own merit,"Don't get this expecting another hole/pumpkins orgy of angst and anger. She actually sings 'listen-able' songs, I was pleasantly surprised when I heard her."
1,This Ty - Jumbles cat is a fire hazard,"I got this toy for my grandchildren a while ago and put it in the dryer with damp laundry to fluff it up for a bit. The cat came out totally singed and smelling very badly of burned fur. Needless to say, I didn't give it to my granddaughter. I complained to the manager at the Ty Customer Service line and he wouldn't have any of it. He said all toys have been tested and are perfectly safe !!!! Well, this one isn't, if it can't be put in the dryer. Another cat ""Aurora Tux Flopsie"" was allright, nothing happened, it was nice and fluffy after being in the bag for 6 months"
2,Fast liner's dream came true,"As a game player in offce politics, you could either fly high or sink deep(odds are against you most of the time-the house always win, while this film showing an exception in a hollywood way)..."
1,Doesn't work,"This product is a good idea but it really didn't work for my couch. Didn't seem to help at all. Not sure if other couches springs are designed different and would be a better fit for this product, but it didn't work for me."
2,"Funk, funk and funk . . . oh, and FUNK","Sly moving the Family Funk more towards James Brown, using a more angular approach than he had been doing combined with interesting drum/bass sounds. Plus the scratch tracks before the metamorph gives us a look at the ""before & after."" BONUS!"
1,Tandem Toe Protector,Really hate the clear plastic ones but I like the cloth ones. will not buy plastic ones again. I do need to get another cloth toe protect. You sold both clear and the cloth ones so pleASE send me an email so I can pour chase the clothe toe protector.
2,THIS CD TOTALLY ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I first heard about this cd when i was looking at the review for another cd. I went out and bought it just to check it out and i havent been able to stop listening to it ever since. The lead singer has an awsome voice. This is one of the few cd's that you can listen to all the way through. My favorite songs were ""Grand Theft Autumn/Where is Your Boy"" and The Pros and Cons of Breathing"". Please buy this cd. you won't be disappointed."
1,Horrible Book!!!,"I'm an IT graduate and am very accustomed to reading technical resources. This book is one of the worst I have seen. The screen caps that are referenced in the text are hardly ever on the same page as the text. Lots of the descriptions about radio buttons are a twist on the descriptions given by the environment. Clumsy book. I don't know what to recommend as replacement, but not worth the $50 I bought it for. I wouldn't even pay $25 for it."
1,"Oh my, what an inexcusable fiasco from universal!","When I received this for Christmas the year of its release, I was unaware of the framing issues. I had to ship parts 2 and 3 back to them for replacements. On top of that, there were warbling sound issues with part 2, and the Michael J. Fox interview ran about 8 chapters before kicking you off and back to the main menu.(This was reported on many websites) Also, the trailers were all full screen, not widescreen. Apparently all of these issues have been fixed in the 2005 re-release. The thing that angers me the most is that since I couldnt return part 1 to universal initially, ive got a disc with the trailer in fullscreen instead of widescreen....ughhhh. I can live with it in fullscreen and I am not gonna exchange the set for a 2005 set because who knows what more crap ill have to go through with Universal. Thanks for nothing......pass this one up until its reissued with new features!!"
2,"And so, it begins...B5 Season sets!","At long last, the regular BABYLON 5 series finds its way to DVD and I, for one, couldn't be happier. J. Michael Straczynski developed an incredible assortment of characters rich with depth, complemented by engrossing story arcs and snappy dialogue.The first season is a solid introduction to the B5 universe, which really doesn't kick into high gear until Sheridan arrives in Season 2. However, a great foundation for the series is established in Season 1, and you certainly can't go wrong with characters like Susan Ivanova, Michael Garibaldi, Kosh, Londo Mollari, G'Kar, and Vir Cotto. Also, Season 1 brings us the wonder that is Zathras and sets up a great time-travel story not fully understood until a later season.So, thanks to everyone involved with bringing us the first B5 DVD set...Now where's Season 2?"
2,One of the best books I ever read!,"This book is about a girl named Beth and she is talking about her worst school year, but it turns out to be her best school year ever. One of the funny parts was when the Herdmans stole a baby and marked up his head with markers and they called it the tattooed baby. Another funny part was when they had Eugene crack walnuts on his forehead and the crowd was yelling ""Go Eugene, Go Eugene!"" and then they yelled, ""Go Hammerhead, Go Hammerhead!"", and he wouldn't stop until all the wlanuts were smashed. When a kid had his head stuck in a bike rack, one of the Herdmans taped his ears to his head. Another part is when a kid named Howard doesn't have his blanket, he will hold his breath until he gets his blanket because that's his favorite blanket. Anybody in third grade on up should read this book. It's one of the best books I ever read."
2,Great Book!,I bought this book to add to my collection of Ellen White's Writing. I love her writings which are very clear and to the point and is in line with the Word of God.
2,"Excellent, obviously inspired by many talents","I disagree that if you like Hate Me you'd be disappointed by other songs on the cd. The songs had similar hate me themes. The melodies seemed inspired by Pink Floyd, Peter Gabriel, Bare Naked Ladies & others, all bands I enjoy. If you buy it for Hate Me I think you'll enjoy all of what this cd offers"
2,Exceptional,"I am as good as Consumer Reports but cheaper. These aregreat; convenient, light weight, durable, effective.Not for in-door use; therefore must be put on - where? -in a cold garage? - and taken off in a cold garage (forexample). Which isn't ideal - if the Yaktrax are wet andcold and iced up.BUT. My best friend could have used a pair recentlywhen he was simply fetching mail. Broke his leg inthree places on an icy path."
2,Wonderful,One Of the best songs of Johns I love it ..I went out and got it right away.John is right up there with George Strait and Olde ones like Jim Reeves.Hes the best and I love him and all his songs
1,The problem with multiple storylines,"The sentences in this book are beautiful, the paragraphs dense and packed with expression, and the chapters long and self-contained...With all this, the novel manages to be an utter failure. There are two major problems. First, the main plot line of the novel, the story being told, is rambling and long-winded, stylistically correct, and fantastically dull. I wanted to give up that part of the book, and only read the more contemporary of the storylines, which moves at a faster clip. The issue is that the more contemporary of the storylines (which is only adequate) is maybe 30% of the novel...when 70% of the novel is boring you to tears, that's bad enough. Second, the characters are forgettable. I would use more damning language, but they're not worth it..just forgettable. There's no defining characteristic, ZERO personality, and no life. So, it's a tremendously well written book, but a complete waste of time."
1,Huge DMB Fan...and this album is by far the worst,"DMB tried to do something new, and it failed. They just tried to rush out this album after the Lillywhite Sessions was leaked, but not released. The album in my opinino has 4 good songs: So Right, Dreams of our Fathers, What You Are, and Everyday. However, it also has many of DMB's worst songs ever (I did it, Angel). Go buy Before These Crowded Streets, that album is sheer perfection."
1,Falls short of expectations,I thought it was pretty decent until I owned for 12 days short of year and the unit just shut off and died while I was playing a video game. Now I have to deal with shipping it back to the manufacturer and waiting an indefinite amount of time for them to ship it back. YES!I should have:A. Bought something else entirely.ORB. Paid the extra money for a product replacement plan knowing this wasn't going to be reliable.LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE.
1,I've seen them live...at my High School!!!,"Yes, believe it or not, Starcastle did a dance gig in my High School(John Vianney H.S., St. Louis, MO) gymnasium back in ~1976 featuring one of the first (former)lead singers of REO Speedwagon. They rocked the house!! Very good band, and very good CD."
2,fun but cheap,i hadn't planned on buy this but amazon had a deal if you got this with another toy. works great until it falls on the table or floor then the shape will deform and will no longer be balanced.
2,Perfect,"we bought this for our 3 year old for when we went on vacation and it was PERFECT! It blew-up easily, the cover was nice and soft...needless to say she loved it!"
1,I found not a single useful bit of information in this book for librettists.,"I wanted to know about structure, song placement, roles of songs, examples of structure, any kind of tips at all.This book was so weirdly conceived - it seemed to be written for people who know nothing about musicals at all and was certainly not helpful as a guide or reference book for writing them.I haven't found any other good books on the subject but this really was useless."
1,SUB PAR,"As you can tell from the unusual cover art, this 1956 session was never issued on LP. The problem was not Franks' flute playing but he is having obvious tonal and technical problems on tenor. Not his usual smooth self. Curtis Fuller and Hank Jones are also in the band.---- If you have Franks' NORTH SOUTH EAST--WESS session be advised that Frank Fosters'- NO COUNT session was recorded at the same session with the same personell Benny Powell, Henry Coker, Kenny Burrell etc."
2,The Best EVER?,"This is simply the best rendition of these two concertos you will ever hear. The recorded sound on this Phillips CD is simply amazing. You can hear the reverberations of the piano strings on some cords, something that I have rarely if ever heard on ANY concerto."
1,OK,This is an OK Book. Much of the stuff you see in this book is available in SDK docs too. There are not many good examples.
2,Wonderful behind-the-scenes in recent political history,"This is a perfect book for those looking to get insights into politics that you won't get from self-serving politician autobiographies or ""insider"" scoop from newspaper reporters turned authors. Ed Rollins' career spans some of the more formative years and races in recent times. His wit and honesty made this book a wonderful, easy read. I will never look at some politicians the same."
1,This product sucks,"Trying to obtain software for this remote is like trying to get the launch codes for the nuclear missles!I have been trying for two days - they promised to send me a link to the download within 2 hours but most definitely within 24 hours...did not happen for either of those timeframes and they do not care when you call them on the telephone. I got bounced from department to department with each one saying, ""gee, I'm sorry I can't help you, but I will transfer you to someone who may be able to""I would never again buy this product and it is only a gnat's hair away from being tossed in the trash in favor of a Harmony Link or something more reasonable to work with!!"
1,TERRIBLE,THIS WAS THE WORST DVD I HAVE EVER SEEN. THEY SHOULD GIVE THIS GARBAGE TO YOU FOR FREE. THE WORST ACTING I HAVE EVER SEEN. NOT FUNNY AT ALL. I'M SORRY I PAID FOR THIS MESS.
1,Awful Awful Awful,"Awful. Not fully compatible with Windows XP. Once a day I need to COMPLETELY Uninstall/Reinstall (both hardware and software). This card is horrible. Support is almost nonexistent. D-Link cards, though a little pricier, are of MUCH MUCH higher quality. Stay away from this trash."
1,My Name is Prozac,"Superb Voice. Excellent Orchestrations. Mediocre songs. Sad to say, this album is dull. If the song selection had been better, the album would have been stellar. A major disappointment."
2,Greek Mythes,I purchased this book for my 10 year old Grandson who is a great Reader. We love sharing this book and reading it together. He knows more than I do about the Greek gods but I am learning.We now have this wonderful book in common. I also love the pictures. Very good choice and the book is in excellent condition.Kathy Willis - Indianapolis
1,shipping took foreever!,"The book arrived in brand new condition, as indicated, however the book took foreever to arrive! The seller was prompt in answering me back about the status of the book but it took too long to arrive."
1,Joe's book suck... even in the real world.,"Joe, tries to show us that the show screwed up his life. The whole book seems to be him whining, and crying because he choose to do something he later regreted. How MTV and The Real World screwed up his life... yet all over the book, and inside it says Joe, 'the guys from MTV's The Real World, he only used that much for marketing. Saying how much his life was turned upside down. He never talks about the positive aspects, only the things that went wrong, which in turn makes him sound like a concieted person. Everyones issues he discusses always goes back to his whiny girlfriend and their problems. I don't suggest this book to my worst enemy. Fan or no fan."
2,Up to 24in wide!,"I have been using this printer for over a year in my office with a 24 inch roll attached to it.I am not able to print correctly over the network, so i always have to print locally. No problems when printing locally though.The printer works great. I use if for CAD printing."
1,water tank has sprung leaks,"I have owned this model for 1 year. I have used it on 2 separate week long trips in my RV. Initially, I was very pleased with the design, it is sanitary and easy to clean, it does not get smelly. However, I just pulled it out to use for the third time and the water tank has sprung 2 leaks right where the latches on either side attach. I am going to try patching it with caulk, but I feel this product should have had considerably more life in it."
1,AVOID!!,"Been planting Begonias, ferns, impatiens, etc. in patio pots for 15+ years with amazing success until this year and this product. All my plants are luckluster with the fewest, puniest blooms Ive ever had. They look sickly and anemic and pathetic. Wasted over $120 worth of annuals with this horrible stuff. Have to rip out all my plants and start over with new plants and use the old version of regular Miracle Gro. Very angry with all the time and money wasted!!"
1,So cute-- I wish we could figure it out!,"This alarm clock is sooo cute, and my 7 year old daughter loves it. However, I find it needs more buttons-- like a simple ""off/on"" button for the alarm. The only way to turn it off is to go through the whole process of pressing the display and setting buttons in the proper sequence so that the alarm icon eventually goes away. These are the same buttons for setting the date, time of day, 24 hour vs 12 hour clock, AM vs. PM, hours, seconds, minutes, alarm, and/or vibration, so we end up having to reset all of it every time we try to use the alarm. For a sleepy kid (and mom), this sequence is impossible. I have the manual sitting next to my bedside to read how it is supposed to work, and have my daughter bring me the ringing clock while it is going off in the morning. This is a poor situation for an alarm clock! It is cute-- but too hard to work it!"
2,Wonderful Christmas music!,"I grew up listening to this at Christmas time. I have the record, but I wish someone would put this on a CD!!! Please! :)"
2,Very interesting story - flawed delivery,"Sadly, this true story of a teenager who achieved some remarkable (and remarkably dangerous) accomplishments in amateur nuclear experimentation is marred by author Ken Silverstein's personal prejudices. Silverstein spends the first six chapters of the book ranting against nuclear energy, the protagonist's social failings, and... the Boy Scouts, of all things. Go figure.The tale is definitely an interesting one, but skim the book up to the middle of chapter 6 and then begin reading in earnest. Most of the reason you bought the book is chapter 7.If your politics lean to the extreme left, add an extra star to my rating."
2,Great follow up album,"The second and unfortunately last album by one of the greatest and most underappreciated bands differs in the overall sound from the previous album in that its less ethereal, more earthy and pop. If you prefer (as I do) the more dreamscape sounds of the first album, then this is only slightly less as good as their debut. It's still light years ahead of most other things out there. And in the first track Julie has written perhaps the most beautiful lyric I've ever heard (""somehow I need to love you more than I need to breathe""). If you appreciate the likes of Sarah and other Lilith artists, get this CD."
2,Reconnect,"This book gives voice to that connection to the earth that so many yearn for, or remember, or even know daily. It is wonderful when such hard won experiences can be shared and given the grace they deserve, accessible to all. Magic though, how Jorrin by subtle turns brings one to a sense of awe for sheep and goats!"
1,An uninteresting story about unlikeable people doing nothing much in the desert.,"This novel centers around a married couple who are supremely selfish and emotionally defective. I guess that makes them ""sophisticated"". Their friend, follows them into the desert where they all complain about how dumpy things are. They then meet a mother and son (?) who are even more horrible then themselves. They travel amongst the natives of the Sahara, but have no great desire to know them, and then they either die, go crazy or are abandoned. End of book."
1,Just when you thought things couldn't possibly get any worse,"...they have. What's next? ""Sounds of the Survivors: Music to Eat Rats By""? Or how about ""Big Brother is Watching You: Hilarious Outtakes from the Hit TV Sensation""? Apocalypse now? Maybe."
2,The world doesn't deserve Evan Dando,"This is one of my favorite albums of the 90's. Great melodic songs with poignant lyrics. If you listen carefully to the songs, the album is basically a love letter from a scared young man with a drug problem. Kudos to Evan Dando for the courage to record such an honest and open album. Is there any lower-self esteem love song than 'Bit Part'? I'm referring to the original CD that doesn't have the gratuitous 'Mrs. Robinson' cover track, and track 5 is honestly titled 'My Drug Buddy', not the antiseptic 'Buddy'."
1,Friends Season 5,"my purchase arrived in good time. case was in good condition. said it was new but the cds didnt play good. some episodes would skip and not play at all, not very happy with item."
1,Very boring,The entire double set is very boring and the songs are all played very tight. The only part I like is the guitar solo on Time but I don't think that it is sufficient reason to get this double album. I'd rather pay twice as much to get a live set from the mid-70s(which I did) then get this again. You'll see the difference.
1,Could of been wonderful,"The heroine desperate efforts to make the hero fall in love with her, is not my idea of a good read. There is enough of that in real life. I like it best when the hero falls in love first, but if both hero & heroine fall in love aronund the same time, I'll take it. But in this book the heroine is inlove from the beginning, and the hero does not fall in love until very late in the story. To me such a story line is a waste of my money and worse my time. I wish there was away of knowing before you purchase a book if the hero was not going to fall in love and/or commit until toward the end."
1,Arrived with broken handle - poorly casted.,"Looking at the reviews below, this product seems to routinely arrive with at least one broken handle. The boxes are not properly shipped, and the casting of the pans themselves appears poor. Returned the one I received (with broken handle) and went back to using a stone."
2,Good for what it was intended for.,"The product came fast from Amazon. The cat door is well made and easy to install. I strongly suggest pulling the target door off it's hinges to do the install if you are installing it in a door.I am using this cat door to provide access through my fence for my cat to get to the side door of my garage where I am using a different cat door to control access to and from the garage to the outside.I have 2 indoor cats allowed into the garage but not outside; one cat that is allowed in the house, garage, or outside; and one only allowed into the garage or outside. I used this in my fence to allow the outdoor cats access to the side of the house and outside garage door without being bothered by my dogs as it lets out into a fenced garden area that the dogs can't get too. At least that's the plan. LOL."
1,Dissapointed in this Blu-Ray version.,"This being one of my favorite movies of all time, I must say I was really dissapointed in what this Blu-Ray version had to offer. Not a single deleted scene. On NBC, Braveheart was aired with added footage. Why was this footage not included in this 2-disc version? Owning the DVD and having seen this movie probaly 10 times, simply having a little sharper picture doesn't justify this purchase. The special features in the original DVD are actually better than the Blu-Ray. If an extended version is ever offered I will be the first to buy it, but I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this one."
2,SUPERB SOLO,"OKAY, SO I'VE BEEN A FOREIGNER FAN SINCE I WAS 14. I'M NOW 35. BUT LOU PROVED ON R.O.N. THAT HE KNOWS HOW TO JAM AND LOVES TO DO IT. I ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS COOL THAT HE USED FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND AN OLD BAND MEMBER (BRUCE TURGON) FROM ""BLACK SHEEP"" DAYS TO JAM WITH. THE TITLE TRACK IS EXCELLENT AND THERE IS NOT A BAD SONG ON THE DISC! LOU'S VOICE IS PRIMO WHICH IS WHY I EMBRACED FOREIGNER TO BEGIN WITH. HIS PIPES ARE PERFECT FOR ROCK & ROLL. NOBODY'S DONE IT BETTER"
2,Excellent Book!,I got this book originally from the library. It is a very good book. It is simple to read and written by a real person. The author makes it fun to change your diet by giving you a story to play with where you have a team of characters that help you and a team that tries to thwart you. It puts a face behind the pitfalls and the strengths that you are confronted with as you change to a healthier life style. It makes it easier for success than I would otherwise have had. It is working for me and I'm not an easy person to change.
2,Scary what if it were you.,INNOCENT MAN: MURDER AND INJUSTICE IN A SMALL TOWNI prefer non-fiction over fiction but I have read several of his books and enjoyed them. With this book you pretty well knew the ending just not how it was going to get there. What made me look the book up was I saw in the paper where Grisham was being sued by the prosecution lawyer. Thrown out so far and after reading the book you have to feel the prosecution really blew this one. That is being kind. You can do a search and find the attorney's web-site with a rebuke of the book.
1,didn't work for dell 700m,I bought one of these modules for my dell 700m. Installed it easily but once every few days my system crashes or I get a blue screen. I contacted kingston and they said that this module hasn't been tested on dell machines and is configured to work on generic computers only! I wouldn't recommend this memory for dell 700m users.
1,Weak Parker,"I have read every Spenser novel, and greatly enjoyed them. This book is a big disappointment. Read it only if you are desperate for a Parker novel."
2,A BLACK AMERICAN CLASSIC,This is an excellent movie. We all have known of a charter like this or actually met this character in our own lives. I love this movie because the people are real. You can feel what is going on and as usual Sheryl Lee Ralph is beautiful and an excellent actress. Sheryl is so underrated. This is a family movie that you will treasure.
2,For the motivated or advanced walker,"This book was fairly easy to read although it can be technical at times. The book is a good second or third step to walking for fitness but tends to leave out the beginning walker and does little to help motivate the couch potato. The book does give good advice on the importance of warming up and cooling down. Overall a good book, but not for beginners."
1,THIS IS A FIVE STARS MINI SERIE,"I purchased the VHS version and was extremely disappointed by the extensive cuts performed on the tape. Where is the Worthy story, he is an integral part of the story....what was left wasnot worth watching. I only watched the tape once, when I received it. Bring the entire story on DVD"
2,a great film!,"""The Bishop's Wife,"" is such an entertaining and heartwarming film, not just for the Holidays but anytime. It deserves all the stars it can get. I'd give it ten stars if I could. It's well worth seeing and Loretta Young, David Bivan and Cary Grant make a wonderful and all star cast."
2,Great book on yoga - Great results,"I've had this book for many, many years and it is one of my favorite books on yoga. Whenever I stop exercising for a while and start to feel stiff all over - I fondly remember this book. And each time anew I am amazed how much more in only 28 days my body becomes flexible. There were times I wished Richard wrote a 365 day exercise plan, because often when I get to the end of the book, instead of continuing the practice, I stop doing the exercises. Then, later on, I return to it and start again from the beginning. In any event, if you want to become more flexible and like to have a wonderful exercise plan to follow, get this book. It's excellent! You, too will be amazed with results."
1,do not buy,"Save your money and buy something else. The sound seems to come through a couple of straws: thin, no bass, no ""presence."" Worst of all, I can't return them. The Koss earbuds with the foam are the best I've come across for the price, even though they can be fussy."
2,Best yet,"Takes forever to load, even on a fast machine. Good/Fast gaphics, but you must have a ""HOT"" video card and the more (and faster) RAM the better."
1,Not the best,"Klean Kanteen makes water tastes metallic to me (like coins, as someone else put it) and the metal clinks against my teeth, which is like nails on a blackboard. It's not very insulating, either; cold water=cold bottle.I was *much* happier with my SIGG bottle. The water is flavorless, thanks to the lining, and it's better insulated. The shape keeps the metal away from your teeth, and the sport top is really innovative and keeps accidental spills to a minimum. It's not noticeably heavier than Klean Kanteen, and it's much nicer to hold."
2,Shows me how to do what I need to do.,"I don't do many of my own truck repairs. I'm not really into that. But when I want to do some basic stuff like change the battery, replace a light bulb or even replace a vandalized outside mirror, this book showed me all I needed to know."
2,A really good gift,"I'm a college senior and my mom gave me this book for Christmas. At first, I was like ""Hey, a fitness book. Gee thanks, MOM!"" But I love this little book. It's helped me enjoy exercise more and get more out of life. It's inspired me. I am actually going to train for a 10k run in the New Year. This book makes a great gift. Thanks mom for getting it for me!!! ;) - Jess."
1,The Trouble with Lemons,"I give the book The Trouble with Lemons two stars because it was a slow-paced book. It was kind of boring and didn't have much adventure in it. It told too much detail in too short of a book. When reading, I couldn't stay focused and lost interest in it. I thought the beginning was good, but after they found the body, it slows down and jumps to a different subject. I think it would be a better book if it had more adventure in it and it went deeper into the mystery of who killed the dead body. One of the reasons that I liked this book was that it was easy to read."
2,Disk change was because. . .,"of the poor quality of the DVD 18s, those notoriously horrid double sided pieces of crap. There have been tons of problems concerning damage to these double sided disks, specifically the Farscape Starburst Editions and the show American Gothic. The change was welcome, simply because I had received one of those screwed up disks, and I would have liked it if they had not been damaged. If your disk is damaged, return it or buff it. Unfortunately, when the 18s get damaged bad enough, they are useless, and they are damaged VERY easily."
1,Minus five stars,"This movie is a genuine setback for the intellectual future of mankind. Somebody in the production team should be slapped, I'm not kidding. I read somewhere that Ford and Pitt tried to distance themselves from this stinker, and I'm not surprised. Shame on them for taking the big Bucks in the first place. A case of two pampered actors adding fuel to a (then) fire that really needed no fuel adding to it, from a safe distance, whilst doing themselves a lot of good in the process. To just say it's confused, etc, is really letting it off the hook. It's awful, but if you're into 'pro Irish/anti British' you'll probably put this right next to the copies of Braveheart and The Patriot you already have on your shelf. If you haven't seen it yet, just borrow it, and don't say 'thankyou' to the lender.Take care,Baby Cromwell"
2,Bought for my FJ,Needed a manual for my Landcruiser as I do my own work on it.Although a good book in itself it could do with a few better illustrations and clearer wording in some of the instructions.
2,BEST FUNDAMENTAL OUTLOOK ON SUBCONSCIOUS MIND OUT THERE,"I would recommend this book TO EVERYONE IN THE WORLD... Even if you have no idea what this book is about- BUY IT NOW!!!I've read several on the subject and while this is a very basic outlook that doesn't go too far in-depth, it is still very informative.If you are the person who needs scientific evidence in order to believe anything, THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU!If the above statement applies to you, I would suggest ""The Cat in the Hat"""
2,Eye-opening and empowering,"I wish I had picked this book up years ago. After getting this in the mail I read the entire thing within two day and all I can say is if you think you could benefit from this book, then you are right! A must read for anyone who had/has an alcoholic parent that affected their childhood.Through this book and seeking therapy, I have made the choice to no longer let my childhood experiences affect me and my ability to seek a meaningful intimate relationship. I have voiced to my sober parent that I will no longer contribute to what has been keeping our family apart for nearly 23 years, and the sentiment is that they wish I had said something much, much sooner.This book will change your life, or at least how you look at it."
2,Things you thought you knew...,"This is not the most well-written book I've ever read, but it's definitely one of the most thought-provoking. Some of the things Cialdini reveals seem like common sense to me, but the rest really surprise me -- not that I am a sociologist. Some of the techniques have also been very helpful in gaining compliance from my kids, who are only 2 and 4. We have an older edition of this book, and I like the layout of that one better -- easier to read. Asthetic aside, this book will raise your level of awareness, even if only a little bit."
2,A Jewel,"This gentle book of poetry is wonderful and would make a good gift for anyone fond of New England and the outdoors, be they child or adult. James Hayford was encouraged by meeting Robert Frost when young, and went on to be an evocative, if unjustly overlooked, poet. The title of the book suggests his grasp of imagery, and skilful rhyme and meter predominate throughout. In the Frost tradition, Hayford's style is not flowery, but simple and direct. In four sections (one devoted to each season, as expertly selected by the book's editors), he celebrates the simple joys of jumping in hay, spotting wildlife, playing in snow, trains in the distance, etc. Gorgeous black and white scratchboard illustrations by Michael McCurdy add to the quiet enjoyment."
1,This saw not as good as the Hitachi C10FSH with Laser.,"Didn't want to review until I used both this and the Hitachi laser dual slider (Hitachi C10FSH 10"" Dual Bevel Slide Compound with Laser) for at least a few months. Both saws are great. However, I give Hitachi the extra endorsement because:1. Hitachi can bevel to the right and left (dual bevel). The Makita can't. If you do trim often, you will appreciate this feature.2. No laser on the Makita. The laser on the Hitachi is dead on. No need to lift, check and recheck. This is a time saver and it is very accurate.3. Slide action on the Hitachi is smoother than the Makita.4. Hitachi has a softer start and is quieter.This is a good saw, but the Hitachi a better saw for an extra $30 which gets you a better saw plus dual bevel and laser.I have been cutting laminate flooring, trim and cabinet faceframes with both for a few months. All my contractors prefer the Hitachi.Good luck shopping!"
2,Another Vampiric hit for Brian Lumley!,He keeps them coming. E-Branch and its followers have their hands full with these old Whamphri and its nonstop action. Its just another addition to an already perfect collection.
2,good but light,"Great light reading for late at night. Some good gems, examples; ""I knew by 10 years old that life would be happier if only I were quite stupid and devoutly religious.."" or, ""Happy work is as gratifying as sex or hard laughter or love or good drugs."" Or about boys, ""I wonder if they will grow up to be adult males who are led by their penises and wallets, or if, at thirty, they will visit sad friends."" And, ""Your looks start to go about the time you start growing up, about the time things are starting to gel.."""
1,BEWARE Cut Version!,"I sold this DVD version of Wayne's Alamo on Ebay after I watched the CUT documentary. And where was the documentary cut at? All the interviews with the Mexican actors, or participants of the film were deleted from it!!!! When I watched it a few years ago, I noticed something wrong with it, and I soon realized the parts where the Mexicans were interviewed were cut out of the documentary! A trip, indeed. This is a piece of crappola, and MGM s/be ashamed of itself....but, knowing its past history, I know it isn't ashamed of itself in this racist cut of a documentary! It just wasn't the same without those Mexican participants somehow! It was lacking spirit because of their slanted cut of those Mexican participants in the film, shame on you MGM!!!"
2,A landmark record,Water & Solutions is an album so far ahead of it's time it's untrue. These guys set the foundation for a generation of emo bands. Coming across like a mixture of Helmet and Quicksand these guys mixed muscular metal with indie-rock. I would highly recommend this album along with Their first album Tin cans with strings to you.
2,not bad,"The kit contains everything you need besides the fish so it is a really great kit. Makes an awesome gift but I reccomend going to a store and purchasing. When it arrived in the mail, the lid on the wasabi container was shattered and the rice bag was torn open and rice was everywhere... luckily it was all contained in a plastic wrapped packaging so the rice was contained in the orginal packaging but it was a gift for my boyfriend so I was disappointed when it arrived and we opened it. We just put the wasabi in one of our own tupperweare container and the loose rice in a ziplock bag."
2,Go Pickers,"One of my favorite shows, like the boys, they bring alot of interesting visits on their picks and they always meet great people!"
1,sad story,"The story was was a quick and easy read (finished it on a sunday afternoon with plenty of time for chores,etc!) but The plot was VERY far fetched, character development flat, and the ending was absurd, manipulative, and in my opinion cheapened the story and made it seem pointless.if you want to read a book, just to feel sad, and not much else, then this is the novel for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for a well written story that you can learn from, then look elsewhere."
2,Another Awesome Black Keys Album,This is another great one by the Black Keys. I have recommended them to so many friends and they have all loved them as much as I do!
1,You Give Video Game adaptation a bad name!!,"Let me begin in saying that even if Amazon creates a minus stars, i wouldn't have givin it to this piece of crap. Hmm, where do i start: zero plot, zero action, zero dialog, zero acting and above all zero directing. I think the director is in a sacred quest to bury the videogames adaptation to movies once and for all. By not buying this DVD and filling the makers pockets, you're doing your self and the world a favor."
2,Hard to contain all the superlatives...,"as of August 2009, this is the best version of the HBO miniseries. No need to offer a review of the series itself - let's just stay to the medium:""Gritty"" video adds to the almost documentary-styled direction. Noteworthy HD audio. The AVS blu-ray tier forum, and Blu-ray . com have this set correctly described in terms of PQ and AQ.If you can get the set for under $50, get it."
1,False advertising at it's worst.,"After read the title, ""Life's Greatest Miracle"", I assumed that this was a documentary about Rush's ""YYZ"", and not about stupid fetuses! Babies arn't miracles, there are literally millions of them everywhere! I was a baby once, and that didn't seem very miraculous. Neil Peart's drum solo on ""YYZ"" off of ""Moving Pictures""? No human could pull that off without divine intervention. That, my friend, is a true miracle!"
2,"AGAIN, ANOTHER JOB WELL DONE MRS. ROBY....","This book was very good, as well as all of Mrs. Roby's other ones. It's nice to see Mr. Curtis Black get a dose of his own medicine. It surely kept me interested, although i do hope this is the end of the Curtis Black sequels. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a lot of drama filled books, but dont forget to read the first two books before this one."
1,Terrible product,"I tried this stick out to compliment my old Namco arcade stick. They shou'dve spent less time with the metal, and put more of the money into developing responsive buttons and a stick that registers motion correctly. None of the extra features matter if the basic design is flawed so deeply. A controller's first and really, only purpose is to enable you to move your character around smoothly onscreen. The Shadowblade fails at this. I've used Ascii sticks, Hori sticks, Mas sticks, and the Shadowblade isn't even close though it shares a similar price range.Shop around. There are way better sticks out there. Especially if you're a fighting game fan, you're just torturing yourself if you buy this mess."
2,"Grab this, your favourite book and a cup of tea","I'm far from being a Jazz specialist, so I'm not going to try to categorise ""Come away with me"". I hear Jazz/Blues (""Cold cold heart"", ""Turn me on"", ""One flight down"", the title track) and Folk/Country (""Lonestar"", ""Shoot the moon""). Norah Jones has a beautiful voice, natural, often sensual, a little bit smoky but not too much. I loved the arrangements, with a lot of piano, acoustic guitar and a soft rhythmic section. I guess some people will find the album too down tempo but I enjoyed it. Both arrangements and vocals are soothing. In a word, it did click with me.The slightly more upbeat and folk ""Feelin' the same way"" and the mesmerising ""I've got to see you again"" would be my favourite picks, but I never skip a track. I would consider purchasing her next recording. If you like Cassandra Wilson, give Norah a try."
1,Not a fun movie!!!,This movie isn't fun and I thought it was interested but nothing. Also they acting were so unsatified. Unfortunately this movie hmm I can say it's not perfect.
1,Not a great read,"As a first grade teacher and the parent of a seven year old, I find this entire series quite horrible! I know that the school in the book is supposed to be wacky, but I dislike characters in children's books that claim to hate school. I hate the overuse of the word ""dumb"" as well as all the bathroom humor. Of course my son loves it for those very same reasons. I just don't think it's necessary to include that stuff in children's literature. There are plenty of great kid's books out there - I'm encouraging my son to read those instead. also, the characters are mean to each other and there's a lot of teasing that goes on - aren't we all working really hard to make sure that stuff doesn't happen to our kids? Give me the Magic Tree House any day!"
2,My family interest,"Affordable, unique, and can better serve the family with the same intensity compared to a regular movie screen without any hassles."
1,"Slow, boring, no passion",The writing was slow and boring. There was no connection between the characters. I just really couldn't bring myself to care. The only reason I would keep this is that it looks like Rufus Sewell is one of the models on the cover.
1,Very poor bang for your buck!!,This item was made in a very cheap way and was very overpriced. It was bought to give as a gift but I changed my mind after the item arrived.
1,"No Laps, Just Be Happy","This is purely for beginners and those afraid of the water. Splashing water on your face, getting your face under water, floating, touching your toes -- basic ""let's play in the water"" games. Only a few of the 39 minutes relates to swimming, amounting to nothing more than a promo for another $50 video. If you or a friend or relative has truly never been in the water before, this might be a 5 star product. It might be just the thing for those who need a lot of hand-holding and reassurance. But don't expect to learn to swim from it, much less learn to swim laps with the big boys. ""Happy Splashing in the Wading Pool"" is more like it."
2,Perfect Tool,"Hi All,I bought this book to start learning programming, and even tough I had no previous experience on it, I can freely say it's really easy learning it with this book. Explanations are really clear and easy to understand. Moreover the author helps - through email - solving some problems you may encounter during the learning process. He's very patient and professional. I advice this book for everyone who wants to start programming from zero like me. Very helpful."
2,Rook Cards,Rook cards great shape except the cards in yellow were very hard to see because the color was to light. Had never seen any like them before.
1,A once-fine series descends to hackwork.,"The early Kay Scarpetta novels are quite good, but by this point Cornwell's just going through the motions. This novel lacks for just about everything. I think it was only inertia which kept me going to its completely unsatisfactory ending."
2,Excellent,"I saw this movie back in the 80's when we first got our cable television. I've always wanted to see it again and am also a big Albert Finney fan. It was exactly as I wanted it, bringing up nostalga. It is not a four star (1 1/2) movie for many more than myself. I was excited to have found it and now own it. Thanks."
2,"Crushing, precise, Polish Death","If you like Polish Death Metal, get this album. It has that mid-range guitar sound that is like a technical buzzsaw ripping your face off; it has the ultra-tight precision drumming that is going to beat you to a pulp; and it has gut-wrenching vocals that brutalize you relentlessly. Creative leads add something extra to this also; Vogg has a really cool style.The reason I didn't give it that 5th star is because I think the lyrical content leaves something to be desired; I wanted something more violent and less philosophical. Maybe philosophical would be good, just more creative than this. Neverltheless, it is hard to find original sounding Death Metal these days, but these guys bring something fresh to the scene."
2,"Comfortable, stylish, easy to wear","This is my first time owning Rockport shoes but I am extremely satisfied. They are comfortable, look great, easy to wear. I'll see how they hold up after 6 months but I love these shoes"
1,don't waste your time,"Really funny if you think poking fun at mental retardation and animal cruelty is amusing. Should have got an ""R"" rating too."
1,Horrible,"This book was just horrible. No plot, no character development, and then there's the stupid fight scenes. I wonder if Jean Rabe could write a worse book."
2,The Resurrection of the Son of God,"As with his other books, this one reviewed the material in the New Testament and matched it with the historic material of the time period. This detailed and insightful material adds to any reader's understand of the period of the first century. I spoke with a friend who is also reading this book. He indicated that his back ground did not make it an easy read. I think this is the case for the book though well written is not an easy read for someone who is not used to reading this type of literature. It is after all a scholarly work and there are always points in the work that are disagreements over technical details and this requires of the reader a knowledge of this area of scholarship. I have in joyed this work for I must admit that it reinforces the understanding of the resurrection I have held for 50 years."
2,a crowd pleaser and an outstanding performance by the ever lovable Aaron Eckhart,"A charming comedy about a loser who finds himself in his struggle to remain himself. Aaron Eckhart is simply irresistible - if you haven't liked him by now, you certainly will after watching this little gem."
1,fibromyalgia for dummies,well i knew the book was going to be used but i was a little disappointed because coffee had been spilled on book and it looked like no attempts were made to clean it up at all
2,Love it!!,I am a paramedic student and researched steths for some time now. Very happy I selected this item. Makes listening to tones easier than other models I have used before. This is def worth the money....
1,I should have read the reviews,"This book is full errors. Examples: Don't use aspirin and warfarin together, all copies of the DEA222 are sent to the DEA after being filed out by a pharmacist. I stopped taking the practice tests after 90 questions because I am afraid this may actually worsen my score due to all the wrong information. I don't think this book was written by a pharmacist."
1,Terrible Tea,"This has to be some of the worst tasting tea I have ever tried. It leaves my tongue with a somewhat raw feeling. The flavors must be all artificial and not natural,and there really isn't much of any flavor that can be tasted. If someone handed you a cup of tea it would be pretty hard to tell the flavor. Don't waste your money on this. You can get much better tea at Walmart that cost a lot less. The box the tea comes in is very cheap, and relly isn't worth anything.Jim"
1,An example of disorganization,You'll spend most of your time waiting for something to happen. There is essentially no connection between the CD-ROM and the text.
1,Very old styled album!,"All of the songs here are from 90's and 80's genre. The vocals are good but there is a little ""filler"" in each song. I was very disaapointed and, I wasted my money."
1,Belongs in the Linux for Dummies line of publishing ...,"With all due respect, this is trully a waste of your time if you are expecting to get info on Fedora Core. Page after page is burned on such trivialities as 'ls', and 'cat' commands; even how to delete a word or a line using an editor. In reality, this book has very little to say anything specific for Fedora. It may have a redeeming value as an intro to Linux for newbies...but flops in this respect as well; newbies will look at the title and continue browsing for other books. You can have mine for free if after reading this you are still considering buying it."
1,Find the Musicl from te Movie,Check out the imixes on itunes.com and type in Girl Next Door for all the great songs from the movie in one playlist.
1,BlueTooth only works on some Phones,"I had one of the older TomToms that I was happy with, Bought this one for the Blue Tooth to use with my Samsung Model Sph-M500, I found out It would Not Work with this Model, after emailing support. They should have made that known before I bought it, And I would bought one that was Compatible.Capt Tom Stone"
1,Not so good...,"I'm guessing it must take a while to work, cause i was using it for a month and nothing happened. It just made my face really DRY...but everyone is different so it might work for someone else."
2,The Other Boleyn Girl,"This is one of the best pieces of historical fiction that I have read. Very hard to put down, the story keeps you wondering what will happen next, even when you know the historical ending.A very enjoyable book to read!"
2,Great classic movie!,Great movie it is one of my absolute favorites. I would recommend to anyone who's a fan of The Duke.
2,Fantastic,The video is great and so is the series. The only thing that could be better is if amazon had episodes past 53
2,Snatch It Up,"Wonderful product! The only way it could be better is if the nylon heads withstood heat to 600 degrees. The locking feature makes it a pleasure to store, and retrieve. Unlike most metal tongs, the nylon heads are gentle on food, and the coated handle relieves hands from heat."
1,"Does not have Zipper, Velcro, or Drawstring.","This is a little better than a plastic trash bag. If you hold it up to the light you can see the small holes at the seams where water can get through, and it did get through. Don’t buy... its complete junk."
2,The elusive basics,"This keyboard gets it all right: understated looks, standard layout and key travel (with no dopey L-shaped enter keys or such atrocities), no silly multimedia buttons (Lenovo does make a keyboard with gobs of them if you're into that sort of thing), comfortable typing, and good build quality."
1,Please don't further fuel these people's narcissism,"You know, my grandmother always taught me that wealth and success were blessings to be appreciated and contemplated in private, and to be grateful for because they are distributed unequally and can disappear at any time. I have to wonder what these people's families taught them, besides the lie that money makes you important and you have this wealth because you are somehow just better than other people. The vulgarity and transparent social ambition of the participants in this book just make the whole exercise in narcissism that much more lame. The bad design, bad attitudes, bad values, and ignorance on display here show a real waste of the doubtless costly education lavished on these children of vanity and greed. They would be pitiable if they weren't so arrogant.And their apartments are mostly just really ugly."
1,"If I could have selected no stars, I would have.","Hi I'm a 15 year old from Hudson, OH. My mom purchased this book as a recommendation from one of her friends. One day I picked it up and started reading it, I was appalled! I have never in my life read anything so juvenile. What a waste of trees. It didn't even take me 2 minutes to finish, I didn't crack a smile once. These two money hungry women must have bashed their ex-husbands past the point of common sense. It makes me want to write my own book, as a matter of fact, I might just recycle this disgrace to paper and write my own."
1,Not that great,"Sleep MD does what it says, in a way. it helps me drop off to sleep. I go to bed around 9-ish, and I take one then. I'm asleep within half an hour, but I always wake up at 3am, and am wide awake and unable to get back to sleep. I had much better luck with melatonin drops I got from my chiropractor that I took 3 times a day than these things. Plus, they were a LOT cheaper. I have a hard time functioning with less than 8 hours of sleep, and while the melatonin drops gave me that, Sleep MD can't even allow me 6."
2,Lord teach us to pray,This book is a call to prayer. It propels you into the place of prayer. You can hardly wait finish the chapters to go and pray. I gave it 4 stars for its length.....wish it was longer
1,No Support From Acer,"I ordered an Acer laptop for my son for Christmas. He opened it yesterday and it wouldn't even boot. I contacted the Acer warranty department (after 20+ minutes on hold). They require that I pack the laptop safely. They require that I mail the laptop to them. They will repair it and return it (they indicated it would take at least 2 weeks). So essentially, I am out the time, effort, and expense of packing and shipping, my son has no present to enjoy for at least two weeks, and I paid new laptop price plus expenses for what will be a refurbished laptop by the time we first get to use it.I told Acer that I did not like their response (I wanted a replacement), and that I would publish my experience in as many places as possible for everyone to see. Their representative did not care. If enough people pass-up Acer they will learn to provide better customer service, or they will go out of business. I hope you will choose another laptop."
2,best fantasy series i have ever read..,"ihave read all the robert jordan series of the wheel of time and i still cant believe how good they really are. this guy is amazing and the world also seems so real to me when i am truly engrossed.i have read other comments and i agree that sometimes these books can drag but i feel it becomes worth it due to the sheer excitement it gives and pleasure seeing elayne,rand and all the other characters unravel and grow.my only prob i have had is that i read all the books from number one to five then i had to have a break due to what i would call a mind block.this break managed to last for two years,until i decided that i would begin the sixth book.i did and really noticed how much i had missed the wheel of time and all the differing things that occured inside.i am now eagerly awating the 8th book with excitement.."
2,"... and if you know what you're doing, it's probably great!","I'm not a techie -- that's an understatement. But I'm basically kinda smart. So I somehow managed to figure out how to set the turntable up, despite some very confusing directions. The last few directions, though, involving the counterweight and grams of pressure required, would probably make sense to someone with a degree from MIT, but was Greek to me -- which probably explains why the thing doesn't really work as well as I think it should. I guess I'll have to hire someone to figure out how to really set it up. Which is not the way things oughta work..."
1,a little disappointed,"I love the TEKKEN series, having worn out TEKKEN 2 and TEKKEN 3...but I'm a bit disappointed by TEKKEN TAG. It looks great...there's no denying that, but the moves are basically the same as the earlier versions. I went through all of Julie Chang's 10-combo moves like I was playing T2. And that's boring. I was also disappointed by it's lack of 3D movement (you still only move back and forth)...I'm spoiled by Namco's SOUL CALIBUR, which has significantly more 3D action. This game is a nice VISUAL overhaul, but control and action-wise, you're still limited to the same old moves with the same old controllers. Too bad."
2,School Daze,"If you can't believe that summer is almost over, jump right back into the school year with this scathingly funny first novel, that reminds you just why we still have those nightmares about school after all these years. The hero Helen Drager is trying to get her daughter Zoe into a good school and her trials and tribulations make for a hysterical reentry into the world of readin writin and rimthitic. Highly recommended."
1,Wellington Fanatic Disses French Egomaniac,"Mr. Schom is a Wellington scholor who has written perhaps the best book on that great British general, the nemesis of Napoleon and the cause of Napoleon's eventual demise. Needless to say, Schom is completely biased against Napoleon's good characteristics, or even his bad characteristics that proved effective tools in his rise to power and domination of the world stage. Read someone else's book about Napoleon, and then do youself a big favor and get the Wellington side of the saga from the redoubtable Mr. Schom-- one of the best history books I ever read, much as his Napoleon was one of the worst."
1,Sony is a screwed up!,"Sony is so paranoid of people stealing music that they've made their minidisk player worthless! I have downloaded sermons that I tried to put on a minidisk to no avail, the mp3's just won't convert or something. Other music I have will download fine. Check out Sony's ATRAC system before you buy this, it is a nightmare transferring content to the MD. The sound however is really good, Sony knows how to split the stereo up to very good effect, but overall I sold this because I couldn't listen to what I wanted to. Check out eBay too, they're going for $50! That tells you something right there when you pay $100 and sell it the next day for $50 on eBay!"
2,"Great, but pricy introduction","Check this out if you're looking for a concise and well-written introduction to the philosophy of art. The author explores why we feel art is so important, what makes 'good' art, and major ideas concerning art as introduced by other philosopher.(...) It's 154-pages, paperback, and has several b&w; photos of paintings referred to in the text."
1,He's interested in only helping one person....himself,"This book is one long,continuous run-on sentence of mindless self promotion by Tyler Hicks. He oversimplifies and broadly brushes with ideas and techniques that are not filled out. In addition, he takes every opportunity imaginable to plug the 50 or so other books,kits,tapes he sells, giving his address nearly EVERY time. I kept reading to find some reedeming value, but alas, could not."
2,it's great but...,"I just got this for my birthday. I seems like a great idea, for those that want an easier way to get into Stevie, but for those that are serious you really need to buy the individual albums. The songs by them selves are amazing, no one can deny, but when placed in the correct spot on their respective albums they just pack so much more. It's exponential!"
1,Nothing but regrets...,"With the release of this title EA has gone from my overall favorite publisher to the only one I no longer support. Whether it's spyware/adware or not doesn't matter, the fact that there was no advance notice about it on the e-tailer sites, EA forums or the outside of the box did not allow me to make an informed purchasing decision. In game advertisement is obviously not a feature that EA was proud enough of to list on the box. I would have given the fun factor of the game four stars if I played it but since I don't it only deserves 1 star. Please send EA the message that we don't want IGA in our games by not buying this game."
1,worst fabric softener ever,"Beware. This product will ruin your clothes. I've tried numerous times, using different settings, and this product leaves a greasy residue, and greasy spots on clothes. As another reviewer noted, some fabrics are more sensitive to this than others, although I think I've figured out what is going on. I've noticed that it does not disperse well in water. Instead, it ends up in small globs, that spread out, sticking onto fabric. I gave this product a shot, and I regret wasting my money, not to mention the ruined clothing.On a side note- many people buy Method products thinking they are using a product that is environmentally sensitive, and free from harmful chemicals. Do your research. This company uses ""green wash"", meaning they pretend to be a natural product, when in reality, they use artificial dyes and ""optical brighteners"", which are anything but natural."
1,Streisand COMPLETELY MISCAST,"""Hello Dolly"" on stage is a terrific musical. I've seen Channing, Mary Martin, Dorothy Lamour, Betsy Palmer and other non-names and the show was GREAT. BUT Streisand was completely wrong for this part, she even admits that she should never have done it.It is no wonder it was a financial and critical failure."
1,Bleh,"Guterson gets some points for basic competence in words and some sense of order to the plot. He loses points for what he failed to do, which was make me care about Hatsue or Ishmael or whether or not Kabuo killed the guy. He succeeded in reducing male/female relationships to their sexual practices, and over describing that which need no description. The book celebrated the mundane by being mundane itself. Unfortunately it will linger in English class for the next few years for no other reason than it touches on American Concentration camps for the Japaneese, that is until another even more tragic, over-worded tome replaces it."
1,Piece of Crap,I bought this radio because my last one that I bought in 6 dollars from walmart was broken from its antena and now it could play channels but there was static most of the time. I was too excited about new radio . I got my radio yesterday and it was biggest disapointment for me. This radio had more static than the broken one I had. none of SW cannel is working they are there just for show. None of these channels is clear enough that you can understand something. I will suggest either get some radio that can only work with AM/FM but have clear sound or spend more money and get something that works
2,"An Exceptional, Exceptional Book!","With ""On Being...The Creator of Your Destiny"", Peggy McColl has placed herself right up there with some of the greatest personal development authors in the world. She has expertly distilled the ""Laws of the Universe"" as they relate to personal and professional success, apparently from years of study and personal application. More importantly, she has compiled that wisdom in a unique and easy-to-follow style that allows anyone else to apply the Laws and Principles as well. This information is exciting to learn. As you read each golden-nugget-filled page, you'll be glad you decided to own this book. Get your highlighter and pen out. You'll take lots of notes, and be all the ""richer"" for it. As usual, with books that I find to be this profound, I recommend utilizing them as a teaching tool for your children and as a gift for friends and loved ones.By the way, I found her ""Beingness Guide"" in the book's Reference section to be especially valuable."
2,Good Series For Muay Thai Starters,"This is a great DVD set for begenning Muay Thai. The first DVD walks you through the basics of punches, including jab drills, jab cross drills, Hook drills, punching drills with weights (so when you take the weight off your super fast and powerful).The second DVD moves on to to upercut drills, kicking and elbow drills. Note that these drills are VERY well laid out showing proper footwork, proper punching/kicking techniques, proper punch/kick technique.DVD 3,4 are advanced drills with bags and partners great for the next level after core training. Anyone interested in my original copy can let me now at [...] as I have recorded the series on my tivo."
2,Excellent Read,"The Darkest Dawn is an excellent read. Typical of Tom Goodrich's style, the book puts you ""in the moment"" with the characters and the characters truly come to life. I just finished reading Team of Rivals by Doris Goodwin, Manhunt by James Swanson and Darkest Dawn by Goodrich. They are all unique and excellent contributions to Lincoln scholarship. Darkest Dawn captures the response to Lincoln's death like no other work I've read. You see how incredibly polarizing the event was and how its timing contributed to incredible anger, anxiety and outrage by both north and south. Top Notch!"
1,Captain We need more Power!,"After reading mostly positive reviews, I bought the Black & Decker Cordless mower about 1 year ago.I've had one season to put it through it's paces.I have a fifth of an acre lot, so even less than the manufacturer's advertised area of grass to cut.I have followed all the instructions, leaving it plugged in when not in use.But nearly every time I use it, it does not get through my yard without pooping out.I'm very disappointed, since it costs so much.Despite the savings of trips to the gas station and the fumeless, quiet cutting, I would not buy it again.Be warned."
1,I returned it,"I couldnt use this well. I couldnt cast this without it tangling and casuing a bundle of line. The reel seemed durable and well built, but I just did not have the patience to figure out how to cast this thing without it tangling."
2,Who needs guitars!,"This album is amazing. The saxaphone mixed with the 2-string slide bass makes for a unique and awesome sound. You may recognize ""Buena"" from a beer commercial or from the ""Sopranos."" The band has also been featured in the movies ""Get Shorty"" ""Nothing to Lose"" ""The Mod Squad"" ""Wild Things"" among others. It's one of those albums you can listen to all the way through and never skip a song.I saw them on the second stage of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View back in 97. The audience loved it!"
2,Makita battery,"Battery arrived fully charged and appears to be as advertised. The true test will be after normal use, if it holds a charge for as long as a new battery should ..."
1,Tasted rancid and the color is yellowish not clear,"I would have given 5 stars if it tasted as before because I actually love this brand of coconut water. However, I hated the new taste of it, it tasted rancid and almost undrinkable. I am so disappointed because I bought 3 boxes of them, they are not expired, but I can't drink them. I'll see if I return them. For some reason the 11 ounce bottles are not good. I also bought the 33 ounce package and they continue to taste great. BUT DO NOT BUY THIS 11 OUNCE CONTAINERS THEY ARE HORRIBLE. IT HAS TO CHANGE IN ORDER FOR ME TO BUY MORE."
1,Disappointing,The majority of these games no one has ever heard of. The infoavailable at purchase time does not list what the games are.Very disapointed!
2,"Mysteries, puzzles and codes for educated people","If you liked Rule of Four and the DaVinci Code, you'll love The Club Dumas."
2,College,"When I was in highschool (two years ago now), I used to do track and basketball. When I left highschool I kept the whole running and excersize up for a year. But now that I have to work, go to school and play on a softball team I don't seem to have the time. I found myself loosing my muscle tones and I just bought this workout. It's by far the best 5 dollars I've spent. I've only done level one but I feel it. I also love that she has it split into two people. Most things I like to go faster and harder. But I watch the slower version for push-ups. It's nice too that she knows exactly when I want to turn it off and she's like you better not!"
2,Ignore the ignorant reviews by spoiled 15 year old brats...,I'm appalled that so many people are giving this season horrible one-star reviews for no good reason. All I personally care about are getting all of the episodes in good quality format. If you people care so much about the stupid commentaries you need to stop caring and get a life. Maybe get laid...
2,Intriging,This movie affirmed other literature and movies I've read and viewed on the topic of energy and healing. This film fell on the heels of another documentary I watched on the importance of nutrition to ones overall health; both worthy of consideration and practice. I recommend this movie.
2,Excellent,It was as much fun reading this to my sons as it was reading to myself thirty years ago. Roads go ever on!
2,Addicted to Korean Drama,"I recently finished watching all 81 episodes of Jumong. Without question, one of the best productions I've ever seen, far superior to anything out of Hollywood. Granted the sub-titles can be awful with the cheeper sets (unless you happen to be fluent in Korean). I would recommend you choose the seller ""Kona & More"" on Amazon if you have the chance. I initally ordered a cheeper set and found the ""english subtiles"" to be anything but English. When I gave ""Kona & More"" a neutral rating they were all over it. They were determaned to make me satisfied. They did. They immediately shipped me a more expensive version with great English subtitles. Once the subtitle issue was settled, I'm sorry I've finished the 81st episode. It's the kind of sadness when you've finished a really great book, or movie."
1,Big Names ... Big Bust ...,"I had the misfortune of seeing this movie in the theatre. I was not sure when, but I would guess shortly into the movie (like 15 minutes) I was ready to leave. There is a lot of violence and shooting, but even that is not well done. It was one of the worst movies I have seen. The action scenes / violent scenes seemed to be not only a bit extreme, and I don't mean that it was too intense as much as out of place and overkill, but the plot was pretty poor as well. It just seemed that they were throwing a bunch of special effects (shootouts and explosions) and some big name actors /actresses at the movie and figuring that would be enough to carry the movie. It didn't work ... add this one to another Kevin Costner flop. Right up there with Waterworld!!"
1,not a Startech as advertised,"This item was purchased because it was advertised to be a Startech - speecific application of a specific Startech USB to DB9 serial function was needed.The device that I received was an off-brand clone with a different chipset. The drivers included did not work, I had to download several different versions from other sources before finding one that actually worked. Had the vendor actually shipped a Startech as was advertised, this driver chase wouldn't have happened.Beware of cheap chinese clones masquerading as the real thing."
2,"Simple, Effective Sharpener","I was concerned by many of the lukewarm and negative reviews, but took a chance based on the reasonable price. Glad I did. This sharpener puts good points on standard pencils with little effort. Simple enough for my kids to operate. I'm sure it's not the finest sharpener money can buy, but it is a good sharpener for a good price."
2,a very good cd,the hit what its like is the best song today that describes the life that many indivduals encounter eery single day
2,Dose not slip out of screw (good for hot work),"If you deal with devices that have a square recess option on the terminals, get this. In the remodeling/service world of electrical work these are a good find. They don't slip like Phillips head and are faster (more controllable) than flat head when working hot."
1,What's up with the Skechers Quality?,"The day I got these, I put them on and pressed down with my thumb on top of the shoe; I wanted to see how much toe-room I had (everyone does that, right?). My thumb created an indent, essentially caved-in part of the toe area that I still cannot get to 'pop out'.I bought these to replace a nearly identical pair of Skechers that I purchased in '04 that lasted 7 years! These ones won't make it through one season. I question whether the Leather Upper is actually leather at all! It feels like shiny cardboard."
1,If you have no imagination you'll love Star Wars!,"I respect the fact that Star Wars is an extreamely popular film. However, after watching it, I felt brainwashed -- no human elements to the film. The special effects just took away from what could have been a good story. The acting is mundane and direction is pretty much the same. I will never like any Star Wars instalments, but today's children are lacking imagination, so it's easy to see why these films are so popular."
1,Not recommended,The magnets aren't very sturdy. Some of the states don't even fit together correctly and the magnets slip out of the book---it would be nice if it had a latch or bag or something to keep them in. I would only buy this if it was less than 5 dollars.
2,"music to dream, laugh, mourn, and sing to","i love this cd, i love OTR - i have never heard a more soulful and angelic voice, or words that spoke to me - and even for me - like the lyrics to these songs. the first time i heard OTR was when a friend took me - i'd never heard their music before. i was entranced."
1,Not worth the money,"Blu-ray of the Extended Versions would be worth the price. As it is, the standard DVD's of the Extended Versions look pretty good upscaled and viewed from my sofa 12 feet away."
2,A Masterpiece,CEREMONY is a rare masterpiece of fiction from one of America's greatest writers. Profoundly moving; exquisitely written.
1,Please don't waste your money!,"I don't think I have ever read a book that left such a bad taste in my mouth. To start, some of the author's descriptions should definately not be read while eating. It is possible to be graphic without being gross, but Morris must not know this! Also, every character in the book is bitter and/or disturbed. The only person I liked was the bad guy - he was the only one not continually complaining! Lastly, the book ends on what should have been a turning point for the most bitter character, but true to her nature, she ruins not only a potentially beautiful moment, but the end of the book as well."
1,wrong product too,"This is the first Barney CD I've ordered, but it's a wrong product too!! The songs on this CD are the same ones on Barney's favorites vol. 2. Very disappointed!!"
2,vellux blanket,"I have always been fond of Vellux blankets.The quality is good,they are lightweight,good for summer and winter.But the current one I purchased is not really as good as the old one I feel.Not as soft."
2,Awesome camera!,"I love this camera! I had a 3.0 megapixel Canon Powershot that I was looking to replace, so I went with this newer Powershot and it takes great pictures. The images are extra sharp and the sound quality on the video mode is superior. It is very easy to use, I use mine every day. I love the anti shake feature the best. It has allowed me to take better pictures than I've ever been capable of. The price is unbeatable too."
1,So disappointed.,"After reading Philippa Gregory's entire line of historical novels surrounding English royalty, I enthusiastically picked up The Wise Women. Not a good move. While Gregory is a masterful story teller, this particular story is twisted and dark and sometimes nauseatingly obscene, and I was very disappointed. Various strings of the story were never even resolved by the end of the story (what happened to the wax dolls?). And I hated the very ending...it did not redeem Alys in my eyes and seemed an impetuous move on her part, not true repentance. Many of Phillipa Gregory's characters have both good and evil qualities (Anne Boleyn), and I love that. No matter their faults, I sympathize with them. But I found nothing in her capricious character Alys I could identify or sympathize with. So sorry I read this."
1,Lasted one year,"After just over a year of using this lock, it no longer stays connected for me. On more than one occassion, I have locked it around the seat on my scooter while riding home and in the middle of the ride it will just pop open. When I went to unlock my scooter yesterday, I didn't need to bother. The lock had openned up on its own and was just laying on the ground next to my scooter. For a lot less money, I could have just gotten a normal bike lock that would do a better job."
1,not very good,"this cd is by far mxpx's worst cd. it has no possibility of being a good punk cd. i know there pop/punk but this is pure pop. if you like a good punk sound get there older stuff, thats good because this is a horrible cd.i just hope their next one is totaly different and a lot better."
1,response to 'Reality Check',"Dr Hagar is not ""out in June 2004."" In fact, he has been appointed for another year (starting in June 2004). Time magazine reported that ""In his private practice, two sources familiar with it say, Hager refuses to prescribe contraceptives to unmarried women."" Do not buy this guy's book. If you must, borrow it from a church."
1,Not a fan of Maxtor,"I have/had a 160 serial ATA 100 drive. Worked great for less than a year. After a bad shut-down (forced by a locked-up computer) I received failure messages on boot-up. I attempted system recovery to no avail. I then turned my computer over to experts who are still trying to accomplish a data recovery process. In talking to them, apparently they receive more failed Maxtor drives than anything else. My recommendation-Go with Western Digital or Seagate. Maxtor...I want my money back!"
2,Some of his best work,"Occasionally uneven collection but contains what is arguably Keaggy's greatest songwriting (his most underrated attribute): Maker of the Universe, Here and Now, Let Everything Else Go, Noah's Song. Maker of the Universe is worth the price of the CD alone. If you like Keaggy's songwriting and his mellow side, this is his best CD Other than the outstanding 2CD collection of his Jesus Freak period -- What a Day/Love Broke Through."
1,"Good songs, bad package.","Great White is a great rock n'roll band and their covers of Zep and others ARE worth checking out, but these tracks are available on two seperate discs already making this release needless, as well as in bad taste with the cover (which Amazon says is not an available image), and questionable. The band, and those who lost their lives in Rhode Island deserve better. There are other questionable releases the band is fighting against, so check out their official website before purchasing anything."
2,"Truly for the creative person, not for ""wannabes""","This book changed my life. I read it when it came out 10 years ago, and I have never quit reading it or giving it to people who I think will benefit from it. You see, this book isn't for people who are thinking about becoming creative -- looking for some prescription for creativity. NO. It is a deep analysis of what happens to you as you create. By raising your consciousness about such issues as tension and resolution (in writing and performing any of the arts) you become more aware of the process of flow, and how it applies to just about everything you do, everything you involve yourself in, and most importantly, everything you create. I was amused when I read his subsequent book, ""Creating,"" because it's obviously a dumbed-down version of ""The Path of Least Resistance."" Do yourself a favor and dive into your processes more clearly and with more joy by understanding them - a la Fritz."
2,Must Have,This pillow is well worth the money. Expecting first child and have history of back problems. Sleep soooo much better with it. Will use after pregnancy. My new best friend!!!!!
1,CONTINUOUS EMASCULATION .....a slight correction please.,"Whoops!So sorry - I meant to call this movie a ""large, calorie filled English TRIFLE"" - there's obviously no such thing as an English Triple [unless it's ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday""].also""Glenda Jackson is one of the most gifted acresses of the 20th Century - no one has [not had] ever reached her zenith"" Apology to Ms. Jackson - she's still # 1.blame it on the tri-focals.Sorry again."
2,Living with three generations of an immigrant family,"From steerage passage across the Atlantic from his native Slovakia, we follow George Kracha to Braddock, Pennsylvania, and share the lives of three generations of his family in the Mon Valley. Bell's narration is direct and graceful and his characters breathe. An integral piece in the American mosaic is presented here. This book will be of especial interest to those of Central European descent or familiarity with steelworking or the Pittsburgh area, but far beyond that it is a moving statement about being human and becoming American."
1,Western Taiji?,Major flaw: the sword is too light and too western looking. Chinese sword is never patterned with an eagle and the Holy mother.
2,required,"The 4gb cruzer is very nice, and perfect for my immediate needs. However, if I need to buy another in the future, I will probably search for one even smaller and without a blinking light on it. But at least the blinking red light lets you know the thing is working. I also immediately upon first use removed the free software loaded onto the stick."
2,My Favorite Book EVER!,"My favorite book ever! Its a completely believable story about life in West Texas early in the 20th century and the hard working, opportunity seeking folks that inhabit that part of the world. Song writer Robert Earl Keene describes the area as the place where settlers heading west just gave up. The inside notes on the book jacket say it best: The characters are not all bad but none of them is all good, including Tyler Aldridge. Big, good-natured, shrewd and given to practical joke...etc...He's the cowboy of the title by the way. The story is narrated retrospectively by an 80 year old woman who lived through the Galveston hurricane as a girl, a tornado as a bride, and a tragedy as a woman. I encourage everyone to enjoy this hilarious and tragic tale by a true Texas author, Katie Breeze"
2,this one makes sense!,"like water for chocolate (named after alfonso arau's movie/laura esquivel's novel como agua para chocolate?) is common's greatest work yet and so far this year's best hip hop album. I hope this time common gets the respect (AND the money!) he earns. that would definetely make sense.thomasps. this album includes fantastic collaborations with d'angelo, mos def, ?estlove, slum village, mc lyte and, most of all, with jill scott, one of the biggest hopes in nu soul (just listen to her single slowly surely). I'm desperately waiting for her album who is jill scott?."
2,The Great has become the Best.....,"In Tenchu 2 you use many Ninja style weapons some that were in the original game, others that are new like flaming arrows. You use stealth to sneak up on your enemy and kill him/her without them knowing what hit them! The game is really bloody for some this might be great for others it might not be all that good. Tenchu 2 comes with a new feature the mission editor, in the mission editor you can create your own levels and place enemies within the levels! It's a great feature that makes an already great game even better. All together the game has 29 levels, 3 playable characters (the two Ninja characters that were in the original game and a new Ninja character),22 weapons, a mission editor, and many hours of fun. For those of you who like games that are based on stealth this is a game you can't pass up!"
2,Dog loves it,We started her on this food a couple years ago. She is 12 and it really brought back some of her sparkle. Her coat and skin are also looking much better.
1,Children's Fears,"I purchased this book specifically because my daughter has sensory issues with exaggerated fears of the dark and monsters. It was a bit helpful in trying to assuage her fears but it really didn't calm her down and had to read the story to her a few times. I was a bit disappointed but my daughter brings up the story when she has her bad days dealing with this type of fear. The drawings in the book didn't really help her and at times had the opposite affect and frightened her.She did respond to the premise that there were other children with the same sort of fears she has of going to sleep and the dark. For my daughter, she thinks she is the only one to have these kinds of issues. I did appreciate that the book was able to make her realize she is not alone with her fears."
1,A Disgrace the Beethoven's Greatness,"Having watched this DVD, I must inform all of you that it is simply a travesty. It starts out in a promising way, seeming to be a biographical documentary, but then deviates to a strange incomprehensible silent drama. The main actor makes Beethoven appear to be an angry buffoon who just throws everything in his apartment in a rage and is constantly breaking and tearing everything. The acting and choreography completely clashes with the musical background, and is also filled up with incorrect/questionable details about Beethoven's life.This ""documentary"" is a total disgrace to Beethoven, who by all accounts was a great man. Bernard Hebert (the writer and director) should be ashamed of himself.Stay away from this terrible series."
2,Extemely Inspirational,"Life delivers some incredible obstacles. This story of 5 different women overcoming these obstacles through motivation and unique experience brought me inspiration and a new, positive perspective about myself. This video truly changed my life."
1,Another bad movie put onto Stephen King,"A sorry sequel to a sorry movie, and another false usage of Stephen King's name, and as a reply to another person who reviewed this movie, the original was NOT! a classic! All 5 of these movies are rip-off's of Stephen Kings good name."
1,My PC doesn't let me see it :(,I don't hate it - can't even view it to see it. Should not have purchased the download version. I'll stick to purchasing dvd instead. I wish I could get a refund.
1,Expensive to fix...,"I received this camera as a Christmas gift last December. I thought it was a decent camera - it was compact and had a lot of great features. My only complaint initially was the lag time between shots. Then over the summer, my cradle quit charging the camera for no appearant reason. Since this was a gift, I did not have the receipt so I could not take advantage of the warranty. Casio is charging around $200 to fix the problem. This seems a little on the high side considering the camera isn't even a year old. I won't be buying any more Casio products nor would I recommend them to anyone."
1,Broken,"This little stapler is a lemon, I used it less than a month and it died. It got stuck with every use and I found myself manually bending the staples often when it did work."
2,thanks!,just what I wanted and shipped very quickly and got here just in time for the holiday season! thanks so much!
1,H*LL NO!,"For the love of God! I guess this can occupy the space next to my VHS set, DVD theatrical set, and DVD extended set.Why don't they just put out a LaserDisc edition to make my collection complete.I want the BR edition more than anything, but I refuse to buy a fourth, and then fifth edition of this trilogy.Stupid jerks! I'm going to go buy ten copies of the Ralph Bakshi LOTR animation just to spite you!"
1,"Great magazine, but don't buy through Amazon",I just ordered this magazine directly from Cross Stitch Gold and paid $29.95 for a 1-year subscription. Why in the world would Amazon charge over three times as much for the same product??
1,"Great, but changed my mind after I had my own twins...Read on...",I'm a first time mom expecting twins and this book was so informational. I'll read it again the closer I get to delivering and I'm sure I'll read it yet again once my twins are here. Practical advice and detailed examples for anyone expecting twins!I would read it at night before bed and I'd giggle from the stories. My husband was actually entertained just watching me read it.
2,1st time review,"I don't write reviews, I read them. However, I felt strongly compelled to give my opinion on this one. This is without a doubt the best book I have ever read. I am rating it entirely on the impression it left me with, the feelings it gave me and how I've spent quite a number of days since contemplating and meditating on the words within. A beautifully written book, highly recommended for all faiths!"
2,BRIGHT!,These are quality lights. Very bright. I keep them on an artificial tree in my living room year round.
2,Best Game Ever,"As an avid gamer with well over 5,000 hours under my belt playing RPGs, I can easily say this is the best game I ever played."
2,Not Just for Babies,"Simplicity can be a wonderful quality. This CD is a welcome addition of classical music with a light and happy touch. My grand-daughter actually listens and when the CD is turned off because I think she is asleep, she will immediately open her eyes and look at me....as if to say ""what did you do that for, Nana?"" She is doing an excellent job of training me and we are both enjoying Mozart together."
1,too much talking; not enough instruction,"I purchased this video hoping it would help me with my coaching of two youth league teams. One 10-11 year olds; the other 12-13 year olds. I've been coaching several years with good success and thought Mr. Wooden's video would heighten my knowledge of the game and game preparation. Frankly, I am dissapointed at the long-on-talk short-on-skills development contained in it. Mr. Wooden goes on for long sections discussing tiresome aspects of the game...and the excessive length makes it useless for kids. It strains my attention span. The drills are one or two-on one; if I do these drills, I have eight other kids standing around bored. Good man, dated video style. p.s. The coach of Duke University (Mike K) has an excellent vido out for teaching kids although I can't find it on Amazon and someone borrowed mine. Help if you know how I can get it."
1,"Like it, but the smell is very strong.","The blanket has very strong plastic smell. I've left it out on the balcony for 4 days, but I can still smell it. Hopefully the smell will eventually go away."
1,Very Disappointing book.,"I was excited to read this book because I enjoy time travel books and have always been impressed with L. Ron Hubbards writing. According to the introduction of the book, Hubbard wrote the story as a screenplay and then Dave Wolverton converted it into a book. Usually, things go the other way and people say ""compared to the book, the movie stunk!"" In this case, unfortunately, the book stunk. I read about 50 pages before I began wondering if it was a pre-teen book. I read 50 more and began wondering if I was wasting my time. I was certainly wasting my time. The characters are preposterously simple and unrealistic. The scenarios they encounter are never set up well and the characters reactions are out of a saturday morning cartoon. The protagonist is a near imbecile and he is by far the most intelligent character in the entire story. Save your time and money, this one misses the mark."
2,Love these Headphones,"These headphones are a great bargain. Good sound quality and nice base. Plus they do a good job of blocking out other sounds. The only problem I have with them is over time the cable seems to deteriorate. But for the price you get a year out of them and then purchase another pair. I have three pairs of them. One I use for yard work, one when I exercise, and one for out and about. One item I really like is they have a shorter cord so if you use a arm band for your IPOD player or put the IPOD in your shirt pocket or chest pocket you have just the right length of cord. Though they give an extension section should you want a longer cord. They are in the ear design so if you don't like something pushed into your ear canal, you may not like these."
1,Video cuts out!,When using this cord the audio and video from any of my devices cuts in and out. When I swap to one of my other HDMI cords (blue rigger) there are never any problems. Spend the extra few bucks get a quality item.
1,Argh!,"What I remember most about this show (which was made in Canada) is that series creator, science fiction writer, Harlan Ellison hated this show so much he had his name taken off and replaced with ""Cordwainer Bird""."
2,Caught Fish,"I tried out these lures at lake Lahonton in Nevada. Supposed to be Wipers in there. For those that don't know, a Wiper is a cross between a Striped Bass and a White Bass. Tried worms last time we went, with no luck. Tried these and hooked and landed several Wipers. I am happy, not too easy getting fish out of that lake."
1,Fun,No spoiler (I hope ) so read with caution - but I was enjoying the book until the last page conclusion - then I realized how much time I had wasted with a shallow unfullfilled character (Amy). She had not developed in any sense in the book even as she desired to improve herself and enrich her life. Disgusted by ending. Such an easy out for the writer - must have had a deadline.
2,The lens that should have been included,"This lens was originally part of the 40D kit. I don't know why, but now the cheaply made, overall useless 28-135 mm lens is the only lens you can find in the kit. You are better off buying the body only then purchasing this lens. Remember that the 40D has a crop factor of 1.6 - meaning that you have to multiply your lens by 1.6 - so a 28-135 is actually a 45-216 mm lens. Nice on the zoom part - awful on the other!This lens is equivalent to a 28-136 mm lens - a perfect overall size. Picture being in a 12x12 foot room. With this lens you can shoot a small group. With the other lens (46mm equiv.) you have to climb a chair and stretch - and miss most of the group anyway. Seriously. I've been there.This lens is well made, focuses fast, and is pretty silent. It's now my primary."
1,Not for engineers,"Maybe it's a good book for the Nascar and other North American race car fans to know how those cars are tunned, but it is not really a Chasss Engineering reference book."
2,Michael Jackson-Thriller,"I love Michael Jackson and now that he is gone, I just had to have some of his music while it is still so popular! Great buy!"
2,Just Wild About Harry and This Book!,"If you like Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch, this may be the best book I have read with Harry in it. Why? Fast-paced, Harry's future is on the line, intense storyline, creative plot twists, fascinating trial scenes with parallel detection and investigation moving forward. There's on the edge of your seat scenes. Liked Harry in it, like his new girlfriend. Everything is done well in this book. Great secondary characters, too. Don't start this book if you have other commitments. Save it for when you can read it in a couple of days. It's fairly riveting. The only drawback for me was detailing of the sex trade--somewhat graphic crime descriptions. But the book is superbly plotted and executed. It will make you want to read another Harry Bosch book when you finish this one. I just ordered THE DROP."
1,No message alert with voice mail,"I haven't had time to appreciate fully all the features others are raving about, because I've been so amazed to discover that there is no visible message alert if you're using your phone company's voice mail. You have to pick up the phones to hear the stutter tone in order to know someone's called. The visible light alert works only if you're using the internal recording machine."
2,Pink Rules Big Time!!!,"The best album i've ever heard, when i told my friends about it they laughed now anytime im at there house there playin it!! The best song's in my opion r ""Just like a pill"" ""family Portrait"" and ""lonely girl"" with the amazing talent of Linda Perry. Pink is just as good Live as she is on CD!! All i can say is BUY IT its great, watch out Madonna Pink's comin!!"
1,Not well engineered-some intrinsic problems,"My experience with this product is as follows:1. The snap on hose connector kept coming off.2.The bag tie that secured the bag to the pail didn't seem to be strong enough. The bag eventually slipped off the pail when under pressure even after adjusting it many times.3. Using this product the blower/vac is connected to a large pail via a relatively short hose, therefore the there is some jostling of the pail. I don't think the product manufacturer took this into account. In my estimation product is a bit flimsy. It must be modified by the user to work properly on a consistent basis."
1,didn't like this item,the keys were to close together and there was no speaker on the base. i returned it.
2,Made in America and it works great,"Gave this to my wife for Christmas and she loves it. We all use it, takes a very high load and it one heavy piece of machinery. I am so glad that it is made in America. We can compete."
2,Awsome!,When I watched this i was laughing all the time! This is diffinitly one of my favorites. If your even thinking about buying then buy. Youll love it!
2,Music,"Music should be there to dispell ignorance and say something about the world we live in. Pop stars are there to look pretty. Pop stars spread ignorance through meaningless emptiness. Public enemy are one of the few voices left in music, speaking politicaly cold as always. Long may they continue. Music with a message. This is the way it should be."
2,The best of country rock & roll,"The middle '70s were captured by the song ""Be Free."" Of all of the music, of all the hype, of all the recollections that have stayed with me, this CD is the pinnacle of what was good and right with those times."
1,Waste of money,This is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons.1. This hub will not work with any USB powered devices. So forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub.2. Extremely slow USB 1.1. This device is NOT USB 2.0 compliant3. It is clunky4. Does not comke with a power adapter
1,A rip off,"DO NOT BUY THIS SET, buy them separately first Semester, second Semester & Extra Class Ova, all three dvds together will be around $31 dollars so you save around $100 dollars"
1,THE BIGGEST LIE EVER TOLD!!!,"The Warren Commission is officially off the hook about their lies on the Kennedy Assassination. 9/11 as told by mainstream sources is the biggest joke and should never be believed. The unrefutable documented facts show that there is something wrong with this report. If people don't take time and dig for the truth it's their own fault. Just don't be the one that falls into that naive batch. In the memory of the over 3000 dead on 9/11 and the countless civilians murdered by bombs in Afghanistan and Irag, along with the brave military who are fighting and dying, we can do better than a disgraceful report like this. Check the websites that are mentioned in some of the reviews here and get educated on the unrefutable documented facts. DAVID GRIFFIN is the name you should stamp on your forehead so check out his books please."
2,very good product,"The two gb Nano is a very good product. It has many features such as an alarm clock, games, and calender. The Nano itself is very easy to use and being a first mp3 owner I really like the portability and wide range of music avalable. The space on my Ipod filled up suprisingly fast so if your music library is large you may want to go with a model with more capacity.You have to download Itunes from the Apple website and it took me several tries on my home PC. The Ipod is geared mostly towerds Mac users so if you have a PC than you will have a little bit of a harder time getting your Ipod going.The only thing I don't like about the Nano is the fact that Apple moved the head phone jack and made the Nano slightly longer than the first generation Nano. These changes made getting a case and other acsessories a lot harder than it should have been. Overall the Nano is a very good product and it is compleatly worth the money."
1,Disappointed,We questioned if these were real uggs ! The were very loose and wide on foot and the fur felt worn as if they were used. We have had many uggs and these were a disappointment for as much as we paid
2,watercolors,We got an art set for our granddaughter and she needed paper for her watercolors. I thought this was a very good price. Thank you
2,Apollo Deck Railing Planter,Great product so far. I bought these along with the rectangular to match. Easy to plant in and easy to move around from railing to railing. They fit perfect on the railing.
2,oem replacement,"Installed new keyboard. Exact replacement for one that died aftera coffee spill. Be careful with liquids around your laptop, Keyboard on a PC is much lesscomplicated to replace."
1,Just Strategies and concepts,"Well, i am not a vb6 professional programmer!That was an error of mine, i had a hope on 'moving to' something that would be more consistent than what i can recall from this book.The full coverage of the new concepts, like XML, are taken very lightly, and terms like '...the propouse of this book was not to cover, deeply, this subject...' are very painfull to me.Well, i have to buy other book..."
1,"Hear 1-2-3-4-5 to 20 a hundred times! Very repetitive, boring, but straight forward","I am not sure how should I rate this item. I was searching for a disc that teaches numbers and counting. This does the job very well. It's simple, straight forward, but super boring. Almost put me to sleep when I was watching it with my 19 month old toddler. You hear ONE, and see the number ""1"", and one object appear. This is repeated with different object 3-4 times. Then it goes to TWO. And you hear the count...One, Two....again with a different object, 3-4 times. By the time you get to 20, you have already heard ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE.......a hundred time.There is no pause in between to ""wake up"" the sleepyhead with songs at all. I have to say it's boring. I wish the maker put some songs to entertain the viewer."
1,Stunk,"Don't get this game it is so boring I tried it and hated it. The controls are so annyoying, you have to press r2 and L2 just to step and you have to hold R1 to turn and ..., I mean its terrible and another bad thing is the view. If your lookin for a game like robotech or mech warriors this is not for you. I mean who needs a game where if you get to close to the robot it steps on u and if you are too far away you can lose it behind a building and could be going backwards and you don't notice. It is so stupid. Please do yourself a favor, don't ever get this game."
1,Unsatisfied,I don't know why but when I purchased it the movie was brand new never open but it kept skipping for some reason and tried in two dvd players...so that ruined the christmas present :/
2,Historical Book,"This book is a complete in depth historical reference of the usage of Black Drink. a Brew Made from the leaves of the Yaupon Holly (Ilex Vomitoria). The book is broken into different sections. Botany of the yaupon holly, native american usage of the plant, prehistoric usage of the plant, usage among the Creek tribe (who commonly used the brew), and non-native usage of the brew and why it isn't used commercially today.I found the book interesting and filled with references of early writers who had first count experiences with the native Americans.The reason why I got the book was because I was wanting to try making tea from the Yaupon holly and wanted to learn more about the plant. The book tells more about how Native Americans used the plant and why they did the things they did with the plant.I am happy that I got the book, but it is a historical reference not a book geared toward people wanting to try Yaupon holly tea :-)"
1,Deceptive Picture,I too got fooled. Thought I was buying a sharpener but got a simple cutter. Too much effort to go through returning it
1,Do not buy!,"All of these negative reviews should tell you something! I wish I had bought this at Amazon, so I could've seen these reviews first. They are all correct. There is NO 3D effect at all. In fact, wearing the glasses is a viewing obstruction. We could see the pictures better without them. Also, I don't know if it was my imagination or my frustration, but it seemed that wearing the glasses actually gave me a headache! This would be a much better product if they didn't bother to try to make the images 3D. I too have been looking for slides that will fit into this projector. It wouldn't be bad with plain 2D images."
1,Not worth $30.00,"These sheets wrinkled terribly after drying, faded and faded unevenly, the worst part were due to the patterned knit they were rough and had little tiny knots all over the surface. They were not worth the $30.00, but on a positive note they came with four pillow cases!"
1,Frustrating crap,"Looking for some zombie action I download this one.I find myself with a shotgun in front of a crowd of zombies.Knowing how slow they are, I run up to the nearest one, almost putting my shotgun in his mouth.I fire. Surprised, I see how the bullets hit everything BEHIND the zombie's head.I try again. Same result.I try again. Same result.I try again. Same result.By now my shotgun shells reach 0.I unistall the game and I wonder what could I have done with the 20 bucks."
1,Terrible noise pickup on microphone,"From my end, the headset works great. It connects easily, the battery lasts a long time, and the sound is excellent. The people I call, however, hate it passionately. It seems to pick up ridiculous amounts of ambient noise, far worse than any wired headset I've ever owned. This is very disappointing for a device in this price range.After a month of trying, I've retired this headset from daily use (to the great relief of the people I call), and plan to find something better."
1,Temp off and Set Up Directions Poor,"I purchased this thermometer for a pork shoulder, I couldn't get it to work. After some time of playing with it, I realized you have to hit both reset buttons on the transmitter and thermometer at the same time (wasn't on the directions). Also, I have two instant thermometers that I tested this with, the Oregon consistently stated the temp was 3-5 degrees higher than my two instants, it may not be that accurate. Roll the dice with this one."
1,DANGEROUS due to poor build quality,"My wife and I used to have one of the ""all metal"" apple slicers made by pampered chef, which work great. We used this for the last 2 months after getting it as a wedding present. Yesterday while slicing an apple the plastic handles snapped right off, slicing my wife's hands and wrists pretty good. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you want to spend an evening in the ER. We had only lightly used the product up to this point."
1,Boring isn't the word for it!,"My 2 year-old daughter received this toy for her 2nd birthday. She was so excited about it and played with it for all of an hour. That was a month and a half ago and Lily hasn't been played with since. She really doesn't do much. She only sings two songs! Really, really boring toy."
2,Great writing instrument!,Hard to find in retail outlets. Older model but absolutely the best bang for your buck. Comfortable and precise. Highly recommended!
1,Not a pretty pattern,"Gibson's first foray into a present-day setting, this book seems intent on demonstrating just how much cyberpunk has become synonymous with our reality. However, somehow he makes present day tech feel futuristic even when its not - it's kind of odd, really. Setting aside the usual stunningly beautiful prose, there's not much of a story here, and what there is doesn't make a lot of sense. I liked the central character, but never really believed in her. In the end, the only real enjoyment came from the writing itself, and the way gibson sinks the reader into the funkiest underbellies of places like London, Tokyo and Moscow. Other than that, not much to offer. I've know for a long time that Gibson has lost his chops, but I do keep coming back for more, don't I? Weird."
1,"The clash is a pop band, not a punk band !!!","It's clear than many of thoses song have been written for radio... The Clash are to Punk what Poison are to Metal !!! You woN,t find real punk music here, only early 80 pop songs... If you are looking for punk, try The Sex Pistols, The Ramones or The Stooges, but not the Clash..."
1,Good Lord!,"A let down considering the potential of the topic - Last Judgement. A basic familirity with Revelations might have helped the author out. As it is, this is just a politically correct screed against all faiths with overblown dialogue, a repellant main character, and boring plot.There are attempts for controversy here that are simple bad taste to even agnostics like me. I wish I had waited for the paperback to show up at Goodwill. On second thought, wish I missed it completely."
1,Not satisfied,"I am a first time mom and registered for this diaper bag. I wanted something I could carry easy. It is very easy to carry, however my daughter is less than 6 months and it is already ripping and falling apart. It also not very big and I had trouble fitting all the items I needed to pack inside. I ended up buying a back-pack from Pottery Barn that I absolutely LOVE!I definately do not recommend this item."
1,Skil 12V Battery Pack,"I bought this battery pack as a replacement for the original and it worked great for about one year, now it won't hold a charge. It was used for occasional home projects"
1,"Original? - Yes, but Fairly Uninteresting!","I don't undertand the hype...and found the musical fairly uninteresting. Now the ""drowsy"" part makes sense."
2,Great Straightaway Rock - This band deserves mass Radio-play,"What a great album. The only disappointment is that clocks in at well under 60 minutes. While the album is not technical, it will move you with it's moody songs and catchy hooks. Even if radio stations don't have the courage to play it, give this album a try. If you like the Goo Goo Dolls and/or Lifehouse, you will spin this disc over and over. Go Revis!"
2,Slide Viewer,"This is exactly what I wanted to replace a very old slide viewer. However, the viewer has only one support (in the middle), and it tends to fall over easily; otherwise, it's great."
2,It's really good!,I love the end part when the owner of the house shows up and they dance and everyone just stares at him. Isn't he cute?
2,Very convenient and enjoyable to use.,"I have had my Kindle for over a month now and believe it is one of the most convenient devices I have ever used. Downloading reading material, books and newspapers, has been a snap.The screen is easy on the eyes and overall I am happy with the device.The battery life is not quite as long as advertised - but still works well enough to spend a day travelling and reading without worrying about power."
1,watch for the battery flap,"Creative normally makes good products, but I didn't even have this player a year and the plastic flap that covers the battery chipped off (even after taking care of it well) resulting in my many problems. At first I thought it was my headphones, but I went through three new sets, and the mp3 player still sends input to the left headphone on and off... The headphones work in other mp3 players just fine.This is a decent player but new ones hold more music for the same amount of money. I'm just sad it didn't even last a year!"
2,"""Abbott & Costello Cartoons"" Who Knew? Salsoul Connection Ol' Skool Rarities!","I don't think anybody in their lives knew that the late duo of Abbott and Costello went into the cartoon market. The team of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera (both of late) went into the venture to give the duo's fans something more to like. Bud Abbott voiced these cartoons himself, although Stan Erwin was the voice of his late partner, but he still put on a convincing show. These are extremely hard-to-find cartoons (why are these not out on DVD?)and this VHS is the only available alternative (try to make sure your VCR doesn't devour it). Will the rest of these classics be out there? The world will never know."
1,PAINFULLY HORRIBLE,"I wish I could find something positive to say about this film, but it would be sinful not to warn others about it. I watched this film with some friends and felt compelled to apologize to them afterword. It's difficult to find the right words to describe how unbelievably bad it is. The acting is atrocious, the photography is horrible, the script is non existent and the ending brings a movie that is already painful to sit through to an excruiatingly, tortuous finish, like a slow painful death. It would be hell to be forced to watch this one again."
2,AWESOME CD!!!!!!!,Unwritten Law is no doubt one of the BEST bands ive ever heard. I went to their concert with blink-182. It was awesome. All of these songs are great and have great rythms and lyrics. You should definately buy thid cd!
2,Such cool art,"The art style in this hsow is simply incredible, it has its own unique flacor that is unlke anything else that I have seen before. It was quite enjoyable, standing alongside other greats in the genre"
1,enough Junie B. Jones,"I have read all of the Junie B. Jones books, both to my own children and to the children who visit my library. After 25 HILARIOUS books, Junie B. Jones' antics in Aloha-ha-ha are no longer funny---just plain annoying! Maybe 25 books would have been a good stopping point."
2,We need a man like this today.,"John F. Kennedy held a dinner in the White House for a group of the brightest minds in the nation at that time. He made this statement: ""This is perhaps the assembly of the most intelligence ever to gather at one time in the White House with the exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.""This book is about a remarkable man who started learning very early in life and never stopped.You may find it interesting that the politicians of his age fought over issuesamong themselves much like they do today (short of dueling it out!).Except for his ambivalent views on slavery, which is pointed out within this book,this voice from the past still could help lead us into the future."
2,Midnight Cafe is on the menu at my house.,Teresa Brewer is sparkling and extremely candid in here expressiveness. There is no contrived angst driving her artistry. Teresa Brewer's vocalizations are Fourth of July sparklers with plenty of swing.
2,The border between rap and jazz.,"The first track, ""Excursions,"" sets the right tone: This hip-hop milestone is a richly captivating voyage along the border between rap and jazz."
1,.,"I felt like these have been opened , I was suspicipus of the seal it looked like it was poorly glued on,I could even see the glue in the cap... and the capsuls were loose with the inner powder spilling everwhere not only that it says it should have 90 capsules I counted them and there were 93 capsules what the hell ??? Did some one open these ? I already accidently taken a capsule !!! anyways Im throwing this away I dont even want a refund which i dought i would even get all i care about right now is safety and these dont feel that safe to me, Im not ordering this kind of stuff online again."
1,Buy New,Rebuilt unit worked OK but rebuilt sprayer leaked badly. By the time I replaced it could have bought a brand new unit.. I will never learn
1,IT WAS GOOD FOR 3 DAYS THEN IT BROKE,OK THIS PAD IS MEDIOCORE I HAD IT FOR 3 DAYS THEN IT STARTED ACTING UP AND IT WOULD ONLY WORK IN THE SECOND CONTROLLER PORT TO MAKE SURE IT WASENT MY PS2 I TESTED IT OUT ON MY FRIENDS PS2 AND IT DID THE SAME THING THE REASON IAM GIVING IT 2 STARS INSTED OF 0 IS BECAUSE FOR THE 3 DAYS IT WORKED IT WAS GREAT
1,A fan from Mexico,"I always buy products from amazon and I never have any complains about any of them. But about this product, I am so disappoint because the lids does'nt fit with the 32 oz. containers. I hope that they fix this problem because is a good way to keep your kitchen organized."
1,WOW THIS SUCKS! NEEDS A 0 STAR RATING!,"My god I am truely speechless after hearing this. It is complete trash, and these guys have no talent whatsoever. All they can do is just swear, talk about getting drunk and high, and having sex with skanky teenagers. It's not even music. I actually kind of enjoyed Blackout because it had some decent songs, but this is a bunch of gangsta rap? Yeah right, it doesn't fly like that. It's not even enjoyable. Oh and if you are a fan of Limp Bizkit, you'll love this music. I actually lost brain cells listening to actual garbage. Ahhh, it's worse than working 9 to 5. Ta-Ting!"
1,I'm a model.....,"And I do my little dance on the catwalk....Hey, go listen to Rye Coalition instead. Better yet, Heroine Sheiks, my trust fund brethren.........."
1,Author's Activist JournoList Participation Totally Discredits the Book,The author's participation in Klein's JournoList where liberal elites clandestinely exchanged ideas to collude how to discredit political opponents shows the entire book to be a polemic lie.
2,Good listing,"Pretty good album it was one of the best of it's kind, ranking up there with `Less that Jake' and `Goldfinger'. Although there are some songs that are repetitive (e.g. Suburban Homesick Blues and Not Again) has some really good songs (e.g. Box and the Bear (Song)). This is not the best ska album but it is Mustard Plugs best. The use of the trumpets and trombones was quite good in Evil doers beware, combined with the vocal making it good listing. It could have be better if they had a couple more punk songs but other than that there is nothing that Mustard plug could have changed. This CD got boring after awhile but I still like it. I recommend this CD to any one who likes Ska or feels that they want something different."
1,Does he think he's clever?,"Jim Moore gives a very average narrative of the quite real achievement accomplished by his wife and himself in making their circumnavigation. What completely destroys the book is the author's puerile humor. Are we supposed to roll around laughing as he repeatedly belittles his wife and refers to her as ""the mate?"" Of course he is ""the skipper"" and emphasises all his successes and ho ho ho all his drinking. I think a class of 12 year olds might be amused. For anyone older I'd just say that if you want to read about a circumnavigation choose any account but this stupid one."
2,Good but short,"Peterson seems to have assimilated the best of (mainly) Jeff Campbell and (some of) Don Aslett's advice. Unlike their videos, when she shows you how to clean, she looks like she really is used to doing it for a living. Campbell tells you to knock your feather duster against your ankle to move the dust to the floor, but when Debi does it, she's a machine. I got the same impression watching her wipe cabinets.She moves a lot faster in this short (:34) video than in their 90 minute videos, and doesn't cover as much. I wish she'd write her own book, as she definitely knows what she's doing. You won't learn everything you need to know about cleaning from this video, but it's a great place to start."
1,A sadly lackluster production,"It is a shame that this seems to be the only widely-distributed video recording of Yeomen of the Guard. In my opinion it was Gilbert and Sullivan's best collaboration, but this production fails to capture its spirit. A crucial element Yeomen's greatness is its balance of humor and pathos, but the humor is completely missing here. Joel Grey, especially, in his drab costume, seems to miss the Point (forgive the pun) entirely. Without seeing his brighter side, I felt no sympathy for him at the end. In fact, all of the actors cover up the humor. I also feel that the choreography is extremely dull. In some places, the chorus walks aimlessly around like zombies. The numerous cuts further detract from this performance, especially in the second act. On the positive side, the singing (with the possible exception of Joel Grey) is generally very good. Nevertheless, if you want to see Yeomen as it was meant to be performed, go see a good live production."
2,Inspiring story,"A great book I read while on summer missions overseas. A must-read for any one who wants to be a missionary, or cares about people."
2,They get the job done,No frills here. Could be a bit stiffer (back end still sags slightly even with new struts and springs). Price was a big factor in purchase so I can't really complain though.
1,dissapointment at it's finest,"After reading the back of the DVD case in suncoast I was kinda looking forward to seeing this, but let me tell you this was really not good at all. The Story is kinda hard to follow and really didn't get me interested at all. The action sequences were not all that good at all. The music was mediocre at best. This is an anime that you should rent and in all honesty never buy. In my opinion it is one of the worst anime's I have ever seen."
1,disappointing,"I have read many of Cassie Edwards books and I can honestly say I was truely disappointed in this one. Where was the passion between Shanna and Bold Wolf. The story line was real hard to follow. It was just not one of her better books. After just reading Catherine Hart's ""Night Flame"" this book didn't even come close to compare."
2,Very Helpful,"I've been able to find the meaning of words I couldn't find in my other Spanish/English Dictionary. Great book, especially the background on the words."
1,Don't buy if you want to watch dvd movies on win xp,"This DVD player works fine with windows 98, but if you're ever thinking about using windows XP, don't buy this one, unless you feel that it's okay never to be able to watch dvd movies on it.So basicly any other dvd player works better than this one."
2,Nice smooth bend,"As with every T, Y, or any other piece it directly abuts. I found that 4"" PVC has a bit greater diameter and I have a mitre saw, so I cut off a LOT of 2 1/2"" lengths and used gorrila tape (great stuff!!) on each of the fittings or Gates to fit. Can't tell you how many rounds to make, as every piece of PVC pipe seems to be a little different, but at least it is consistant for each piece of PVC. For me it was somewhere between a round and a half, to half a round, to get a secure tight fit. These take the abuse well that it takes to get everything tight."
1,Not Good By Any Standard,"I enjoyed Ms. Mendelsohn's previous book, but this was an awful read. At first I thought there was something wrong with me that I wasn't ""getting it"",but soon changed my mind. Usually I can put a book down when it is this bad, but I kept thinking it might redeem itself at some point. It never happened. I agree with the previous reviewer that it should be young adult, but then I certainly wouldn't recommend it to my daughter."
2,beautiful ring,Wore this ring with another band to look like a weddng set but didnt feel the same. Ring is very beautiful thou
1,ughhh,"OMG, I bought this a while ago and I now realize how stupid I was!! The strips hurt soooo bad and I noticed nothing on the strip that it had taken off my face. Blackhead:still there. Dirt and Oil: still there. I can honestly report that this did nothing for me. Please, I'm begging you not to waste your money!!"
1,"Great to look at, but lots of problems","Bought two full sets from Pfaltzgraff, plus some bowls and storage containers in the same pattern. All of our plates and salad bowls have chipped from normal use. We've had to throw out all of the soup bowls we purchased with the sets because they developed cracks right through the middle of them under the glaze.And these are definitely NOT microwave safe. You WILL burn yourself if you handle them without a potholder.Shame, because Pfaltzgraff used to be such a top-notched company. My mother's Yorktowne set (manufactured in the US) is still in perfect condition, and they are well over 20 years old and used frequently. These plates, manufactured in China, are a poor comparison."
1,Open Box/Refurb???,"The product showed up quickly, but I was immediately put off by the condition of the box. It was beat up and had holes punctured in the side, and the lights inside had scuffs and markings on them. It is not working and this seller appears to send open box products and refurbished ones and tries to pass them off as new. Just a warning. I will update the outcome."
2,A must-have for any C++ programmer,"If you do any C++ programming, whether you're a novice or an expert, this book is a definite ""must"" for your library. This book is not specific to any compiler or operating system, so you can use it no matter what your environment is. But what's most important is that it covers every aspect of C++ programming that's even the least-bit complicated. I've been programming C++ for over five years, and EVERY time I've wanted to figure out how to do something in C++, not only was I able to find a clear description, but sample code as well."
2,Finally somebody gets it.,"Finally a set of videos that targets busy Moms that actually works and is something you can stick with. The time commit is stellar, short sweet and to the point. I love these videos and know I can do anything for 20-30 minutes. Equipment needed is minimal and Jillian keeps talking which makes it go much quicker. I will be doing these for a long time!"
1,WHERE IS MY MOVIE DISK!@?,Great Movie but I recieved TWO Special Features Disk and a DVD Movie Disk. Where's my blu-ray Movie Disk!? I still can't believe this $*#^. Read aleast one other that has two special feature disk instead of the movie. My limited edition # 28155/3500. Anyone else get screwed?
1,lost leads,"A book of total lost leads, great starts to intrigue, interesting ideas and insights, teasing insinuations, and no meat to be found. A very disappointing book."
1,Not so great,"This clock worked wonderful for the first couple of months. Then the time started changing sporadically, and not only by a few minutes, I'm talking HOURS. It's now completely unreliable. Not worth the money."
2,Bruce Willis standard,First in the series and best until the last one. Decent plot and good acting for movie with more gun shots than spoken words. If you are into action movies then you will like this one.
2,Social Studies Educators: You Need This Book!,"This most excellent collection of fifty-two key documents in U.S.History from 1785 to 1974 illuminates the themes of social and political interactions that have moved this country. The Civil Rights Mini Unit is especially powerful and includes student data retreival charts, timelines, discussion and debate questions as well as such items as the actual amendments, astonishing photographs of ""Separate But Equal"" schools, etc. The actual coded version of the Zimmerman Telegram is as fascinating as Truman's revisions on the memo to recognize Israel. Great teaching suggestions on analyzing Federalism and students will love Eisenhower's response to Elvis as a Roc'n Roll Hero. This is a winner for active learning."
1,watch something else instead,The blurb and preview captured my attention but the movie was plain boring. There was some good acting here and there but the story is flawed and jumbled and the movie runs out of steam pretty quickly.
2,Great Debut from forgotten pop princess,"I do not know why Martika didn't strike gold with this album. Her signature autobiographical song ""Toy Soldiers"" is beautiful. This former star of the Disney Channel's defunct teen variety show ""Kids Incorporated"" should of been as big as Debbie Gibson. Her vocals are excellent considering the time period of the late 80's and im sure by now she has grown even more. But lots of great artists get lost in the shuffle when more pretty less talented people emerge."
2,BCBG Perfume,"Received product on time and was accurately describe by sender. Very pleased to have received item, also not very happy to know there isn't more of this product to purchased."
2,Love this seller !!!,I've been looking everywhere for these double jewel cases and am thrilled to have found them at this great price... Fast shipping too..... I'm very very happy
1,absolute garbage,one broke in less than a minute... scooping chocolate ganache (nothing hard) the other broke in 15 minutes... definitely don't buy...
2,Provides access to Beowulf,"I am neither a scholar nor a college or high school student. I am, however, a reader and a life long student, and Beowulf is a work that I have struggled with forever.After reading this book I understand that I simply didn't have enough information. Johnston remedies that by walking the reader, step by step, through the meaning of the poem by explicating the back story and the mythology familiar to the original listeners.She opens up the work by placing it in context historically, with chapters on religion, language, and culture, which are just as interesting on their own as they are in relation to the poem. And she does this all with a wonderful style that is accessible, concise, and engaging.So, while I recommend the book for students, I also highly recommend it for those just interested in getting a handle on Beowulf and having a peek at a period so shrouded by the effects of time."
1,disappointing,"I love both cooking and reading blogs, so I thought this book would be a natural fit for me. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy much about it. The writing is so-so, and the author's ""deep thoughts"" that come from her cooking experiences are pretty banal and predictable.I did get a laugh that there are book club questions included at the end - I can't imagine that any book club would select this book - there is just not a lot of substance here. I'd give this one a miss."
1,Ick.,"Pages and pages of ranting about how the word ""woman"" is, in and of itself, oppressive. This is precisely the type of obnoxious hyperfeminism that makes women run screaming in the opposite direction when people suggest they might be feminists. An embarrassment to women who fought for things that actually mattered."
2,Vito Bass or Alto Clarinet Reed Guard Model 2439,"This reed guard does the job perfectly. An elastic strap holds the reed to the guard, so that no damage is done to the reed, unlike the Rico/La Voz reed guards which can pinch and damage the reed. The bass clarinet size 2439 also fits alto clarinet reeds. The guard holds 2 reeds per side--a compact and economical solution to storing reeds with your clarinet."
1,PU,"Most reviewers blasted this film when it came out and for once the critics were right. It's so terrible it has a kind of fascination to it as you watch this assortment of fine actors trying to bring some life to a script of pure claptrap. Perhaps McQueen's judgment was clouded by the onset of his mortal illness when he ok'd it. He couldn't have been feeling very well and his discomfort is palpable. Allegedly and laughably based on the life of bounty-hunter Ralph Thorson, it's an idiotic mix of domestic whinery and crook-catching that should have been played for straight comedy. Then we'd have had a happier finale from this great actor."
1,What happened?,"I have to rate the product according to my experience. I ended up being allergic to the main ingredient in this product. It was way too strong for my skin and I quickly began to start scratching for no apparent reason to me and having weird burning sensations, etc. on my face. I would recommend that you make sure your skin can handle this ingredient before purchasing this product."
2,It works out very good!,"We recently installed Laminate Floor and is looking for a good floor cleaning tool and found this one. After using it, found it very good and convenient. The only shortcoming is that it takes many hours to charge each time."
1,sooo small,the picture of the doll is bigger than the actual thing!!! I thought it was a doll and it was a figurine
2,Best Motivator On the Market,"Author David Leonhardt would hate my negativity.There are a whole lot of how-to-search-for-happiness books out there. So why would you want to read Climb your Stairway to Heaven?My answer, dear readers, is that you won't nod off when you're reading this one. This guy is wholly, totally and completely an upper of the unmedicated kind.The fact that Leonhardt is a speaker shines through on every page. His book includes pop quizzes, exercises, fables, quotes and what he calls ""cave-style cartoons."" Take David's advice and ""throw a parade in your honor by cheering every little success."" That success can start by reading this book.If you're a woman, you will want to pay special attention to the section called ""Shine Like a Diamond."" It's full of anecdotes that will inspire you.This book is also full of wisdom. Not an occasional nugget, but chock full of it.Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of ""This is the Place"""
2,Works perfectly,"The instructions for mounting this set on my Mossberg 500 were very clear, and I mounted them without incident. I can now attach a sling without any difficulty!"
1,"A long, tedious, tiresome read","By volume, this book competes with 'Crime and Punishment' by Dostoevsky. By content, it fails superbly not only in story, but in writing style as well.In a nutshell, the story is about an individual who feels betrayed by fate for his insignificant rank in society and one day decides to punish a man he believes is responsible for this misfortune. In all honesty, this is it. For 700 pages the author introduces mundane dialogs and meaningless characters and finally manages to convince me, no, to force me to ache for the death of the poor man, just so that I can see this book end. I seriously don't recommend this book.If, however, you are determined to spend many, many, many hours reading something from the distant past, try 'The Egyptologist' by Arthur Phillips. It is a much more entertaining novel and will make the time you invest reading it seem a lot more valuable.by Simon Cleveland"
1,Counterfeit???!!!,"I love Cool Water, but what I received was not the Cool Water that I know even though the box said so. My wife informed me the scent was very unappealing although she was a fan of me wearing Cool Water in the past. There was a suspect aroma when opening the bottle that gave off the hint of ammonia. Amazon says they will not accept it as a return under the guise of a ""hazardous substance"". This purchase will definitely impact my future dealings with Amazon."
1,Do not like this at all,I do not know why it says Disney because it is actually not from Disney. The songs are old fashinoned and I thought it was just something esle
2,Excellent Blender,"I have had the blendtec for about 4 months now. Yes, sometimes you have to pulse again to finish a smoothie, but at least I don't have to stand over it and push stuff down with anything. I have over 150 fruit/veggie smoothies made and they are consistently well blended. If it is not blending completely, then you probably don't have enough liquids in there."
1,Remember when Anita *KILLED* the monsters???,"Remember when Anita *KILLED* the monsters rather than slept with them?In this book, we see some of the last gasps of a formerly great series as it cartwheels down the slopes into utter drek. The kick-tail vampire humter we liked in the earlier books has given way to an uber-powerful ""mary sue"" that is as irritating as she is unlikable. Add to that sex thrown in for sex's sake and it becomes bird cage liner.The early books were wonderful. Now we no longer have ""Anita Blake - Vampire Hunter"", but rather Buffy the Vampire Layer (and weres and everything else.....)At least the Merry Gentry books have enough good plot to tie the sex scenes together........"
1,Cheap hand blender - burned out FAST,I bought this for my own kitchen after having a BRAUN for many years. It didn't last more than a few weeks. If I hadn't thrown all the packaging away I would have returned it. I was so mad I threw it into the wastebasket. It was a waste of money. It burned out blending eggs and milk. Go figure. I don't recommend it - there are many other hand blenders that will last a long time.
1,Bad Movie,it was like a huge episode of CSI.....lame. very lame...i fell asleep it was so boring. waste of a blu-ray :\ jason statham and jet-li can do way better than this....
2,I really love these bibs.,I really love these bibs. My daughter used to rip the bib off during the meal. Since I got these bibs she can not rip the bib off anymore. The velcro is so strong and stays in place.I suggest them to everyone I know who has kids.
1,JUNK,"Save your money and don't believe what you see on the tv commercials; this not at all as simple as it appears and once you finally are able to get a button to attach itself to your shirt, which can actually take forever, the buttons fall off soon after; a good old fashioned needle and thread is still the best bet!"
1,Does not fit Senseo!,"I was disappointed to find it does not fit my machine. The pods are very densely packed, I can't say how they would work in another machine but they are hard as a rock, maybe that is normal for the other units."
2,Useful book,"I have just finished reading this book. As a fairly poor reader of Japanese, I found it extremely useful. The stories were enjoyable to read, and I could see myself dipping back into many of them again."
2,Loved It!!,"I really enjoyed this movie because it was so empowering.I am not big but a nice size and I have a daughter that is thick and I found the movie to affirm me and her as well; I have heard some negative stuff about this movie and I find that it wasn't what folks was saying about it; and I am tired about hearing what folks consider beautiful and what isn't. Like folks say, Beauty is skin deep and in the eye of the beholder. One of the things I really love in the movie is when Monique told Tunde that she was a better person for having met him and that she hoped to meet a man just like him; I really liked that."
2,What a wonderful book,"I felt that Upton Sinclair's The Jungle was a hauntingly accurate depiction of the life of a working man in the early twentieth century. The only flaw in the book is the ending. My five year old cousin could have written a better ending. The book receives 5 stars from me until page 329, after which it recieves none at all."
2,Chinese Chicken Soup Bowl,"I do love almost all of Annie Chun's products and this one is no exception. I did find the chicken broth to be a bit weak for my taste, so I added a couple of shakes of Maggi Chicken Bouillon granules. This made for a stronger chicken broth and I liked it so much more."
2,every subject needs a history...,"...and this book gives financial risk management that history. It provides a context to where we are now, and allows the reader to glimpse the future through the pathways of the past. An entertaining read, well written and thoughtful. Bernstein has a number of other books but I found this one his best."
2,Great movie,I love period pieces and this definitely did not disappoint. Knowing this was based on a true story made it even better and more enjoyable...specially the ending. Would recommend this to a friend.
2,"Good, but dump the man, Dixie!","I enjoyed this well written book, but I hope that the character of Dixie's boyfriend is not allowed to turn Dixie into a driveling wimp. Many a good independant heroine has been ruined by a ""concerned"" man."
1,Did not work,I bought this specifcally because it said HD DVD. It was a gift for my mother and she owns a HD dvd player. It not only did not work in the HD DVD but on none of the other 5 DVD players we tried.
1,save your $$$...or just flush it down the toilet.,"I love the Pharcyde, Bizarre Ride is one of the greatest hip hop albums ever, but their new cd is utter garbage. They seemed to have regressed to the point where all they can talk about is weed and getting high. They dont even do it well! The lyrics are ok when Imani is rapping, the other 95% of the time is filled with something I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. Save your money, buy the new Hierogyphics or the Non Prophets, anything but this crap. I want to go to California and personally ask the cyde for my $15 back."
2,Scientific medicine is a new thing,John Hunter was one of the champions who introduced scientific methods to medicine over the opposition of those who valued ideology over evidence. He fought this battle only about 225 years ago when doctors often prescribed bloodletting. John Hunter paid attention to evidence that it was sometimes best to leave gunshot wounds untreated rather than apply the remedies physicians often applied at that time. This book is fascinating and is written very well. I was shocked to learn how primitive medicine was only 225 years ago. Our recent progress under the scientific approach has been astounding. John Hunter's personal story was also a very dramatic rise from poverty to recognition as his nation's leading surgeon and physician.
2,The harvest,Love it! Its fun to read somethings when you've already seen the movie or in this case the episode. Thanks Richie!
2,L.E. Targets,"One thing that this photo does not show is that the target has the vitals areas of the body white lined, and so far your getting these at a better price than you would at a gun shop there also big enough for shotguns."
2,exciting,"If you like the Ninth Doctor, you will enjoy this book. I especially recommend it if you like science fiction and video games which makes it a very interesting combination. It is exciting and funny. It is never boring and makes you want to keep on reading."
2,What a tear jerker!,"This is a very touching story about the love of a mother. No matter the difficulties of motherhood, this parent shows the love to her child through a song. Despite the child's age, the mother continues to rock her baby back and forth and sings him a short, yet meaningful song. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. I think I'll read it forever."
2,Filter,"Fit perfectly, works perfectly. Always a good decision to change these things when the humidifier starts to smell like fish."
2,Love Webkinz!,My daughter loves it. I have 3 girls and they all love playing on Webkinz. Very cute for all ages.
2,Lovely,A very good perfume..and excellent given the cost of it. I love the woody fragrance of it ....amazing. I always keep a bottle of it !!!!!
2,Before dinner snacks,"I looked for a special cheese board and found it at Amazon. This cheese board is perfect for cheese and crackers served together in one serving piece. Easy to serve and easy to clean and store. We use it regularly and add grapes for color. It was so popular I ordered one for my daughter's family, too! It's a great gift item."
1,Unreliable hardware - Look elsewhere,"I have had this drive for just about a year and in that time, it has failed 2 times. Both times they were complete drive failures. I have checked with some friends who had simliar LaCie external devices and they reported that all had eventually failed in the short term. (Yes, I shoul have checked with them first, but I based my inital purchase on the recomendation of another friend whom I really shouldn't have.)I have owned a number of computers and drives in my life and I have never had such a poor experience with a hardware vendor. The drive has always run extremely hot, hotter then any other external drive - and I currently have a Maxtor and an HP Personal Media drive, both 300GB, neither runs this hot. Their customer service in response to having to return these drives has been less then satisfactory.Look towards another vendor for an external drive solution."
2,Exactly what I ordered,The dvd stand was exactly what I ordered. If was in perfect condition. It arrived on time.
1,Not worth the money,"I loved the chair, unfortunately the seat part rips off after about two weeks. I bought two of these, and they both ripped at the same time within two weeks! Very disappointed."
1,workbench?,"Very misleading..it is not a workbench at all. It is just the legs. you still have to buy the wood, cut it and then figure out how to put it together..I am not happy with it"
2,Brilliant show,"Wow, i remember watching a few episodes of this show when it was well into its first season during showtime's free preview weekend and i said to myself ""this is the most awesome show i've ever seen"". Californication also marked senor duchovny's return to the small screen and in my opinion, this is his best work since his days on the x files. plus, the season one dvd set is almost worn out since i've been watching it so much."
1,Party For Your Right To Fight?,"Back in the day, no one took the Beastie's seriously; they were portrayed as brainless frat boys who wished they had been born black. Nowadays people regard them as genius innovators. Frankly I'm inclined to agree with the original assessment"
1,Does not work with Mac,Waste of time and money. Quality ok price excellent for the footage. Previous reviews read that is why I purchased can't believe everything you read even this!
2,Great! But incomplete.,"I enjoyed the soundtrack as much, if not more, than the other reviewers, but I was disappointed that this release did not include the original Japanese version of the Princess Mononoke theme performed by Yoshikazu Mera. Hardcore fans may want to seek an import instead."
2,good buy,i like the hello kitty calendars. they are different every year and come with cool stickers.
2,Maniac Magee,"When I first began reading this book a few years ago, I figured it was going to be just a fun, imaginative fiction book. I found out it was more than that. ""Maniac Magee"" displays friendship where you least expect it, overcoming feats, and being strong against racism. This is a great children's book, one that I have read three or four times."
2,Movie review,This is a classy musical combined with a love story that was well done. Cary Grant is great and the music staged in appealing ways. Do not hesitate to recommend this movie.
1,8/12 HANDLES BROKEN,"I purchased two sets of these knives for x-mas 2002. Within 3 months 6 out of twelve knives had cracks on the handles in the same place, by now 8/12 have cracks in the handles. We wash them in the dishwasher along with our other Wusthof knives and the other more expensive Wusthof knives have never had a problen. Also when washing these in the dishwasher the steak knives get rust stains on them that we have to polish by hand. I have been very dissapointed with the quality of these steak knives and will try to contact the company about the warranty."
2,Great new show,"I think this is a great show. Season 1 was fascinating and had many twists and turns, like most families. If the rest of the seasons are as good this will be one of my all time favourites"
2,A caregiver's must,"Soooooooooo perfect disposal washcloth. The thickness and softness of the bath cloth leaves you feeling euphoric, like you were bathed with cashmere."
1,just bad,"Katt looked like he had no idea what he was gonna say up there, and if id have heard ""this is 20-12 damnit!"" One more time i'd have pulled my hair out. Should have used the one set he used for just about every other set he's ever done. At least it was funny"
1,I Thought People Were Just Complaining To Complain...,"I read through the reviews before purchasing and just figured that the bad reviews were people who had nothing better to do than complain so I bought it. BIG mistake, the gears were not made right so they didn't align and I got about 5 seconds of use out of the spaghetti attachment before it stopped rotating on the very first use. Took it apart and the gears where made out of such a cheep metal that they had started to bend on top of not fitting into each other properly. Needless to say I returned it and will be looking for a better quality pasta maker. If you are thinking of buying this you really shouldn't and even if you think I am just complaining to complain at least save the original packaging because you might need it."
2,Wald Front Basket,The Wald Front Basket was purchased to mont on the knee walker. Great way to carry items around without having to go back and forth retrieving one item at a time while cleaning the house to carrying documents to an outside appointment. Thanks for making my life a lot easier.. LMF
2,THE BEST RUSH COLLECTION,"THIS WAS THE FIRST RUSH CD THAT I HAD BOUGHT AND WAS IMMEDIATELY BLOWN AWAY WITH THE GREATNESS OF THEIR MUSIC.I SUBSEQUENTLY GOT MOST OF THEIR ALBUMS TILL ROLL THE BONES.IF YOU LIKE GOOD CLASSIC ROCK MUSIC,THIS CD IS FOR YOU.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IGNORE THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER WHO LIKES ONLY MTV INSPIRED TEEN POP [..]."
1,No/broken charge status,"In the user's manual it states that when charging it will flash red and when it is complete the blue led light will come on. The Manual also said a typical full charge is around 3 hours. The first time I charged it flashed red on the led for 4 hours, I didn't know if it was fully charged or what. I just tried charging again and kind of forgot about it, but I came back 7 hours later and it was still flashing red.I bought my girlfriend a motorola head setMotorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset [Bulk Packaged] that was much cheaper and has better charge indication. Also it fit on my ear better (although both fit fine) and I like how you can turn on/off the headset by flipping open/closed the boom instead of holding a tiny on/off button.2 stars for the high price, poor charge status indicator, and a worse ui than the motorola."
1,Gleason fans,"Anyone into the Honeymooners might like ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" 's Brad Garrett (the big cop) playing Jackie Gleason in a movie. The movie's called ""Gleason,"" and it wasn't bad. Garrett even manages to hide his 6'7 height well. And the voice is almost dead-on.When I first saw ELR, I noticed Garrett acted like Gleason was an influence, and I was right."
1,Can't get anything to work,I tried several examples from the book and couldn't get any of them to work! Either the book leaves out critical steps or it's just plain bogus information. What a joke!
1,Total Waste of money,These stickers do not glow .... Bought this and realized that it is a total waste of money...What a disappointment for the kidz for whom parents order it.... this should be removed from the list... i think I'm entitled to a full refund...
1,Don't make the same mistake I made,"This is the WORST simulation game ever. Once you lose your money, you never get it back. There is no point in it, since your competition keeps getting richer while you keep getting poorer. I never was able to figure it out.-I haven't played it for 8 months"
1,Spiderman 2 game on PC is for retards!,I bought the Spiderman 2 game on PC because I did not have a PS 2. So I played it and the game is really easy. It's like your doing a kindergarten test and every level you beat you just beat it for one second and your on the other level and your there. I beat the whole game on one day. I figured out how to use the keys by myself just like that. I'm 23 years old and a huge Spiderman fan. I enjoy the movies a lot but when I bought this game I feel dumb for buying it because I figured out how to play it right away. It's a great game if your at the age of 3-12. If your 13 and up and just bought it you will know what your doing right away. If you don't know how to play it at 23 and everyone says it's easy then that means your stupid. Do not waste your time on this stupid game just stick with the PS 2 I never played it on PS 2 before but I heard it was better than the PC but if you have it on PC sell it back and stick with the movies or PS 2.
1,What happened to the sound? (Updated),"Like the other reviewers, I love Ormandy's performance and would give it five stars, were it not compromised by the remastered sound, which has an artificial sounding ""reverb"" I don't recall hearing in past releases. It sabotages this release, and I wouldn't buy it for that reason. Too bad since the original Philadelphia sound was magnificent.Updated 22 December 2011: Since I reviewed that C, I l've listened to the same (presumably) recording on another, 2009 CD release on Sony Classics to compare. I've gone back and forth several times and I'll swear I hear a distinctly better sound on the newer release, compared to this one. Instruments sound more forward and clearer and the former reverb is gone, or is much less. FOR THAT VERSION (Sony B0000027BD) I ENTHUSIASTICALLY GIVE 5 STARS! I'm so happy I can now recommend this version to all my friends! (-:"
1,Needs better tailoring,"Although this cover was clearly designed for my BMW 328, it didn't fit right. The left side was shaped wrong and there was a bulge over the instrument cluster that would not flatten out. The price was right but the tailoring was not."
1,The torture of this reader,"I had high hopes for an enjoyable third installment of Cherijo's adventures as Stardoc. After the third detailed description of her being tortured I had to put the book down. I do not find it entertaining to read about heroines being harmed when it adds nothing to the story. More could have been explored with interspecies dating, friendships and the issue of how dumb is Cherijo when it comes to men. I found the character Cheijo not as entertaining in this book, she is stuck hating her mate, being hurt, hating her man and then at the very end she is happy and well as if this was an insipid romance novel. I recommend the first two books in the series for introducing a likable and strong female character. Skip this one."
1,Disappointed,"Dealing with almost ten years of infertility, I really thought this would be a book I'd breeze right through. Barna tends to speak only to IVF patients as she refers to the Lupron Loonies. What happened to the Clomid Crazies which I'm sure many more infertility patients can relate to? Not all infertility patients can afford IVF or even feel led to go down that road so I found her frequent mentions hurtful. I really did not laugh much. I expected to be laughing so hard I'd have to stop to wipe the tears or hold my sides but it was just a chuckle here and there. I found her wording to be difficult at times as if she was trying too hard for a laugh. Lastly, why is this book so much money? If you understand those of us going through infertility then you would also realize much of our money has gone to ARTs, adoption, HPTs, OPKs, doctor visits, surgery, tests, etc so where's the break? $20 could easily go toward a copay."
2,BFLO Wings and things,"My Boyfriend loves this fryer, He is from Buffalo and craves traditional wings like those made in Buffalo NY. He uses this at least once a week. It is perfect for making small batches of fried goodies.I love the fact that it keeps him from distroying my kitchen when he makes fried foods. It never splatters beyond the unit itself. Great fryer for small batches or when one person likes fried food and the other dosen't."
1,Does not work with blackberry 2.5 mm interface,"After the fact I now see some folks that sell this same product clarify it will not work with a Blackberry-- this amazon listing does not state that. I received it and it is mono (not stereo) unless you insert it only half way into blackberry and wiggle it. So be careful and confirm your particular phone's compatability with a 2.5/3.5 adapter,"
2,The Best Starting Place For Card Magic,"Just like I titled my review this is the BEST place to start card magic. It's a low cost investment to the art and has some seriously amazing routines inside. This will cover things like the double lift, the glide and other basics that are key. Not only does it teach this but has a ""lesson plan"" built into the book. It actually advises following the order, learn the sleight and pick two effects to master from that chapter which is great. A lot of book just say ""have fun"" and don't really have a guideline for how to learn from it. It also has great tips on presentation inside kind of like a Kard Klub intro (DVD by Brad Christian) to get you really blowing minds. Let's face it, it's not about the sleights it's about how well you present the effect. A simple key card effect can really amaze people if you present it as a miracle.Buy the book it's worth having about even if you only read it for kicks and giggles."
2,Wow!! You have got to get this album!,"I just finished listening to this album for the first time. I know it is not helpful if I don't say anything negative about this album, but I don't think there is anything negative to say! Without a doubt this is one of the strongest albums I have ever heard. At times it reminded me of an early Spyro Gyra ""jam session"" album. It is tight with amazing synergies between the musicians and it has the same tremendous energy. I am not sure how to classify this music - bluegrass, jazz - whatever... It is just darn good music!"
1,Short Life + Poor Performance = Bad Value,"I bought this as a desktop PC backup.A year after installing it, power went off one day when I was at my PC. I thought I would have at least 10 minutes of backup based on my PC and monitor wattage, but the UPS gave out in about two minutes, before I had finished up and shut down. Useless.Then, 4 months after the warranty expired, the beeper sounded constantly, and the power led flashed, indicating the battery was in need of replacement.The bottom line - Spent $70 for a UPS that never did its job the one time I needed it and failed just after two years. No more APC UPS for me..."
1,Fussy & unpredictable,"After four months use, I find this monitor gives unpredictable systolic (upper number) readings, largely dependent on how much it's pumped up. It tends to be more repeatable with diastolic (lower) numbers. I can, for example, obtain a reading as high as 140/70 or as low as 106/67, purely by changing my pump-to start pressure. I would recommend another monitor."
2,mr,the waffle maker is fine but it did not have any instructions or receipes.other than that it is great.thanks Bob
2,Exactly what i ordered,looked for cheap batteries and that's what i got. seemed kinda shady but the batteries worked fine! don't be fooled by the picture they're legit!
2,"Bright, Shiny and Easy to Use.",It is a sharp looking toaster. Easy to work and toast most breads very evenly.Reason I say most breads it that I can not use the bagel function. (Burns even at the 3-4 setting)And as each type of bread has a different texture and toast differently this unit does very well at evenly toasting the 5 different types of bread we use. Works well for the long bread also.Works as good or better than some of the much more expensive toaster I have tried.
1,Great Series; Horrible Disc,"Sorry guys, I love Prentender just as much as the rest of you--in fact I have bought all four seasons plus the movies. Unfortunately, the discs are ALL defective. At least in seasons 1 and 2 I could still play them on my computer, but season 3 Disc 1 side 1, last episode (I believe it is ""Someone to Trust"") would not play on either of my DVD players nor my computer. Extremely poor quality. I am not the only one complaining about this either--look at reviews on other seasons."
1,Ends Where It Starts,"Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood, in fact everyone in this movie performs beautifully. I was taken in from the opening shots of the back of Mickey's head, but about two-thirds of the way through the film, I realized that the plot was going nowhere and stopped caring about the character. The script was coming full-circle to where the movie started, and honestly, I'm sick to death of this kind of unfulfilling story writing. I want to see a deadbeat's character switch, even if minutely. I do not want to watch a deadbeat remain a deadbeat for two hours and end up a deadbeat. This plot goes nowhere but back to the beginning, and you would do well to watch Nacho Libre instead (which, incidentally, has an actual plot with a beginning, middle and end, and you will actually have a laugh. At the end of The Wrestler, you'll just want to slit your forehead open with a broken razor blade.)."
2,Great Movie,Loved this movie. Lots of action and kept me interested the whole time. I really enjoyed getting the backstory.
1,Not what I had hoped for - Too Easy,"Ok, I had hoped for a fun way to really work my abs, but this just isn't it. The music is horrible and it's barely a workout. I have done P90X, P90X2 and Insanity (but still I'm far from a pro/ athlete) so going from those to this is a joke - And I was even using this as an add-on workout! It's slow and I didn't feel any real abdominal workout... Maybe it's because I'm used to more strenuous workouts, but this was a joke to me. Also, I didn't enjoy Shaun T. as a trainer on this video - He comes across much differently than he does on the Insanity series. The whole video is cheesy."
2,Nat King Cole is great in any language...,"This CD is absolutly gorgious... Nat King Cole sings exotic songs in spainish, sambas, mambos, and some portuguese brazillian songs too, beautifully arranged by Ralph Charmichael, this music is recommended to all Cole fans, and it is even of interst to jazz collectors for Cole's voice in any language swings even to bossa nova... Highly recommended."
2,Superb!,"One of the best Star Trek Novels I've ever read, and I've read plenty. A very powerful story, and while I don't generally care for the ""Enterprise saves the entire galaxy/universe/quadrant from destruction"" plotline, that's because it's not generally done as plausibly as this. Like the best of the Star Trek stories, this one deals with a serious, debatable philosophical question: the value and morality of the Prime Directive and the conflict between a maverick like Kirk who gets things done regardless versus a by-the-book captain less inclined to bend rules. This question was handled very evenhandledly, the characterization of the other captain was very well done, as was the characterization of the aliens at the center of the story, and the drama involved was truly gripping. If you have any liking for Star Trek at all, this is a must-read; if you don't, you MIGHT still find yourself liking (and respecting) this story."
1,Returned,"This ""case"" is NOT worth the money. It's hard to use the buttons when my Sony Clie is in it. You can't charge your Sony Clie with the case on, so you are constantly taking it in and out of the case. I also didn't like the quality of the case itself. It had a huge company logo on the front as well.I returned mine."
2,Nationalism at its finest!,"I think this is a must read for any Irish lit fan. Published soon after the Act of Union 1800, this book really makes Ireland shine. A Englishman's journey to Ireland is confronted with a rude awakening. Everything he thought (stereotypes) about Ireland turns out to be false (well, the bad stuff anyway). Lady Morgan paints a vivid view of the green Isle, from the harsh reality (and descriptions) of the poor, to the beautiful views. I can see how after only 2yrs (i believe) it went through many editions. Must have slapped the English right in their face. While it might not be the best book you will ever read, if anything about Ireland intrigues you- this book will do wonders."
1,Costly bad quality short life span item,One of the most costly remotes with a very limited lifespan. And it takes a pro (or a geek) to set it up. BOTH of mine started loosing functions after just 3 years of use and got completely non-functional shortly after. I would never go for this product again simply because the price is absurdly high for its poor quality.
2,Good overall Information,"Forcuses a great deal of widows, and financial preparation for death of a partner. A few of the cassettes had real meat on them. Probably the book would have been better, so you can ""edit"" the sections that don't apply to you."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this product for my daughter and her new husband as one of their wedding gifts for their kitchen. They used it without any complaint until the inner plastic bag started tearing. It only lasted about 4 months of occasional use. My son-in-law told me that he had to remove the plastic liner and he still has the outer bag, but of course it is no longer good to store bread in to keep it fresh.I really don't like purchasing a gift for someone, just to find out a few months later that the item was of no good use. A plastic gallon-sized zip-lock bag works better to store the bread in than this product. I think the makers of this bread bag would do their customers a service by taking this product off the shelves and going back to the drawing board. If you are considering the purchase of this item, my best advice is ""don't""."
1,Red letter---- boo,"Any one needing large print doesn't need the difficulty of the red print if this had been pointed out, I would NOT have purchased it. The black print is good. Of course the meat of the new testament is in red. Not a very good color to see, especially for any one needing large print. I would NOT recommend this edition to anyone else. I am making do."
1,Not funny,"Not funny...at least not before page 45, which is where I stopped reading. Dry as dirt. The book is in part about an android's graduate thesis on comedy. Unfortunately, it reads like an android's graduate thesis on comedy.I returned the book to Amazon...the first book I've ever returned anywhere.Want to read something funny? Check out Bob Zmuda's biography of Andy Kaufman. You won't be laughing at every page, but even at its slow points, it's 10x more interesting than ""Road to Mars""."
1,"Interesting, but not very funny","The premise is good, but there was too much repetition. Jerry Seinfeld laughed out loud, I didn't."
1,INDOOR Party String Lights,"Title is very misleading...........SAYS right on the box, for INDOOR USE ONLY!!! I got these for my deck and opened the box to discover they are like christmas lights, only you dont get nearly as many lights as you do on a strand of christams lights?????? May 10 or 11 little balls. For the Price...............THESE ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE ""INDOOR LIGHTS"".....Can we say...""Rip Off""!!"
2,"Great ""New"" Material","Some of the songs on this CD have been out for a year, but I still enjoy ""Do It For Love"" and ""Heartbreak Time"". Of the new songs, I have to say ""Forever For You"" is their strongest song since ""Don't Hold Back Your Love"" on Change of Season CD. Also, ""Getaway Car"" and ""Miss DJ"" are quite unique tunes that are more main stream music than what are expected from Hall & Oates. There are couple of filler songs, but this CD is a big improvement from Marigold Sky CD. In fact, this is easily their best since Big Bam Boom album. Somehow this CD does not sound like 80's music. Rock'n Soul lives on..."
2,A Great Book,My daugher and I just read this book lastnight and we thought it was great!! Any kid that watches Doug will love this story.
2,Important Information if you're thinking Chapter 13,"This book provided a good overview of the Bankruptcy process. Fortunately, I didn't need to file, but at least I was more informed about my decision."
1,Not his finest effort,"Steel skimps on characters and action in favor of a lengthy discourse on clones. Avoid this one, a mere contractual obligation for Steel."
2,"They love it, you'll love it.",Your 5 yr old will stay on your lap for the whole book and ask again tomorrow.
2,I am enlightened!,I had a brother in law who has NPD and this book really helped me and my sister to understand who he really was and how he still bothers her in her mind because he was a very verbally abusive.His mother also has NPD and this book clearly mentions that again and again.He is out of our lives but still exists in our nightmares.Thanks to Dr Vakin for an excellent excellent excellent book and opening us up to this great insight.God bless him!!!!
2,Great little cleaner!,"I received this item today and tried it out. I am very happy with it, its lightweight and cleans very well on linoleum. I have 2 small problems with the unit, 1st the assembly intructions are kind of vague, 2nd it does only come with one rag for the bottom of the unit. I will be cutting up an old towel to make more. Overall, I am very pleased and would recommend this unit."
1,poor quality paper feeder,The fax will not feed paper properly without constant monitoring. It takes multiple pages at once and jams frequently. The machine may be ok for home use but is unsuitable for even a small office.HP Officejet Pro L7580 Color All-in-One Printer/Fax/Scanner/Copier (C8187A#ABA)
2,Data couldn't have said it better,"This book is, quite possibly, one of the best TNG books I have read. For once, Data's lifelong wish of becoming human is fulfilled, and he must go through dramatic changes in his social and physical life to make up for it. He also finds out he is left-handed :)An excellent book for any Star Trek fan, especially for TNG fans."
1,AWFUL!,"i hated this movie! it was dull, and confusing. the graphics were exceptional, but it didn't make up for a poor plot line. IT looked really good in the beginning, but it turned out to be junk."
2,OMD5,"These speakers sound really great, but they need a subwoofer for it, by themselves the lack of bass is really remarkable. The size and the innovative design is what you love most about them. Overall if you are buying these speakers to pair them with a sub then you will get amazing sound, otherwise I recomend the Polk Auidio's RTI4."
1,Useless waste of money,"I bought one of these based on the positive reviews. I now assume they were written by Bench Dog employees. This thing is an utter waste of $10. It does not hold the blade unless you raise it all the way up, wasting time. Even then it does a lousy job of holding the blade. I am back to the tried and true method of a block of wood and being careful not to destroy my knuckles."
1,Should be zero stars!,"Where to begin.... how about poorly filmed, no suspense, characters you can't care about -nothing but people being hacked to death, a spectral presence with a spectral horse and the f word ad infinitum. A couple of the actors try to make something of what they are given but the task is too great. For some incomprehensible reason the Moody Blues singing ""Nights In White Satin"" is playing on televisions in the background while the first two or three murders are being committed. Why couldn't this guy have put some of his unremarkable music on the tv? Don't encourage this guy by wasting your precious time or money on this one. Five stars for the Moody Blues, zero stars for the movie!"
1,X-rated!,I bought this UNRATED movie becasue we love horses and horse stores. I threw it in the garbage after 10 minutes of viewing. Thannk Goid my children were not in the room. It was discusting. Nudity and sex. Its not for families. I'm sick I didn't read the description better.
2,Review of Major Dundee,"The disk arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition.The film, although of course dated, was very interesting and enjoyable. I much prefer Charlton Heston in dynamic roles such as this to in his ""epic"" roles such as Moses in The Ten Commandments. He seemed a real person in this film. Richard Harris is also excellent, as are the supporting cast. All in all I enjoyed the film very much and am glad that I bought it."
1,Unbelievable actions,"This book never really grabbed me and I don't expect to be enthralled by every book written by authors I like, but this one was really hard to believe. * SPOILER * of sorts:Who walks into a strangers house and falls asleep on the couch (besided Goldilocks)? Who has sex with a guy she doesn't know and who just had a gun pointed at her heart? How does the first lady have coffee at a diner, coffee shop, whatever it was without every other customer not noticing and taking pictures...? This whole book left me consistently saying ""Really?"", ""Really?""...Don't bother if you like a book that makes sense."
1,"Good show, but...............","When mamma left, thats when it started to go down the toilet. What made it worst was bringing on those 2 idiots, ""Big Earl"" and his son, ""Little Earl"". As Dee would say, that's just DUMB.I DO PLAN ON BUYING THIS $HITTY SEASON, because there is an episode or 2 that's ok, I guess, but all in all- this 3rd and last season, SUCKED. And I dont know about you all, but Re-run annoyed the f*** out of me!! What made the show work were the women- 1) Mamma, 2) Dee, & 3) Shirley."
2,Kudos (mostly),"I bought this book because I am a former minister who is struggling mightily with issues of faith and doubt. I found it to be refreshing and--in some ways--astounding. Too often, anyone who harbors intellectual doubts or leaves the faith is said to be putting up a ""smoke screen"" to cover some kind of moral failure or rebelliousness. Tucker, however, is exceedingly sympathetic to the doubter and refuses such easy dismissals. Her idea of ""doubting your doubts"" as well as your faith was thought-provoking. However, I would add that I was dismayed by her repeated assertions that she could never leave the faith herself. How could anyone write this book and make such a claim? If there is no possible evidence that would cause one to change their mind, then an honest search seems to be hamstrung at the get-go."
2,GREAT speakers for outside!!!,All I can say is wow! These Yamahas really impress. VERY good sound and nice tight bass as well(for a speaker its size at least). Blows away the cheapo home depot speakers for outdoors. Looks very nice and the hardware that comes to mount them is very nice and sturdy. I had them up in about 40 minutes. I ran 14g wire to them and they took them no problem and sounded great behind our pioneer receiver. I definitley would buy more of these if I needed them! A+++ speakers that cant be beat for the money..
1,Terrible!,"I never write reviews, but I had to in this case. Total Junk! Low receiver rating and a poor excuse for private enterprise... Onkyo sickened me with this product so much that I will never buy from them again..."
2,Range Expander Not Too Bad If You Call Linksys,"After reading all the horrible reviews, I was afraid to buy one of these. However, I have owned 6 Linksys products in the past and found that once you get them up and running they are very good (granted, it could be painful getting them working if you get the wrong tech when you call the 800 number). This range expander got me from 1 or 2 bars to a full 5 bars in a NYC apartment that has thick walls. If you willing to set aside 1 hour to set this up, I think you'll be happy. I'd bypass the including instructions and call Linksys from the get-go to spare you some wasted time."
2,Good textbook for introducing the period.,"An interesting overview of a pivotal period in American History. The rise of America from a new nation to an imperial power. Clearly designed to be used as a textbook and in that it succeeds. The Third edition presents much more material than the first edition. It covers politics, urban life, the closing of the frontier and many other important areas of the last half of the 19th century."
1,Does she ever give up?,"A disapointing EP from Madonna. If AMERICAN LIFE wasn't a big enough flop, she had to release this druge. You get some average remixes and a live track, and a b-side from BEDTIME STORIES titled ""Your Honesty"". Well honestly Madonna honey, this should have stayed in the unreleased pile. You think she could just know when something is a flop and move on, but apparantely not."
2,School's Out and The Camp Song,I heard Daphne and Celeste's version of School's Out before Alice Cooper's. I thought D&C's version was the original. Boy was i wrong! Daphne and Celeste made up their own verses and used the 'real' chorus (Alice Cooper's) as their own. I never thought that that was aloud. I like this song; i think it is very unique.The Camp Song is a great song and anyone who's been to camp will appreciate this. It is also very unique. Sounds like a remake!!I don't have this single but want it so badly. Maybe someone will read this review and feel sorry for me and buy it LOL!
1,Big disappointment. Does NOT keep liquids hot.,"I can't remember giving a product one star before. If you put boiling hot coffee inside, them you might have luke warm coffee at best in one hour. It has disappointed us on two road trips where we thought we would be drinking hot coffee. The older Stanley thermoses worked great but these I believe are made in China and the company really is not trying to satisfy it's customers, according to all of the bad reviews on Google. This one is going back to the store."
1,SELLOUT!,"She went from leading a really good band that created some interesting and likable music...........To this, a pop diva! wow way to go Gwen. Just another example of money triumphing over everything else. And when I say that No Doubt was a good band I mean their early work. Their last album I thought was complete trash!"
2,Love them!!!,"I have never owned Uggs but I would imagine that these are just as good. I am currently in College and these boots are like ""the"" shoes to wear. LOL. From what I have seen some other brands do not fit as well as these do. Plus I really like the tread on the bottom of these..I'm a faller in the winter months and have yet to fall since I have been wearing these boots. Anyway..Good boots..I recommended them to my sister and she loves them too =)"
1,Bad magnet mount and Fragile glass,"I bought this and calibrated it using the salt method and it was way off initially (read around 50% instead of 75%). After getting it calibrated and installing inside the lid of my humidor, I was happy with the product. Then after about a month, I opened the humidor to find that the hygrometer had fallen off of the place I mounted it. The metal disk that that was attached to the back of the hygrometer and holds it to the magnet mount (which I attached to the lid of the humidor) had detached from the hygrometer. When I tried to press it back on to the rear of hygrometer to secure it again, the *evidently very thin* glass on the front shattered.The item would have been fine if the metal disk that holds it to the magnet wouldn't have fallen off so easily. Mounting a hygrometer inside the lid of the humidor is a pretty standard thing to do, so for that use I can't recommend this product."
1,DID NOT COME!!!!,"Ordered this toy for my daughter for Christmas, ordered it four weeks prior to Christmas....and it never came!!!!"
1,"Don't Count On It, Countess","This book is the biggest hodgepodge of melodramatic [garbage} I've ever seen. ""Curious George Goes To The Hospital"" looks like a masterpiece by comparison. Then there's the horrifyingly bad translation, which I can only describe as the work of a deeply disordered mind--Jacinthe Leclerc should either be checked into a mental ward or the Betty Ford Clinic (perhaps both, just to be on the safe side). In short, count yourself lucky if you don't read this one."
1,"TV Land to Go: Big Book of TV lists, TV Lore and TV Bests",This is a terrible book for any TV buff over the age of 6.
2,Dylan's finest work in the 70s. A polished masterpiece.,"This album is one of Dylan's greatest ever and in my opinion his premier work of the 70s. Each song is totally unique and brilliant, both musically and lyrically. I've listened to this album countless times over the past 20 years, yet appreciate it no less now than upon it's release."
1,Doesn't work,I tried my tapes in this adapter and it does not work. I tried a number of tapes. I will probably be returning it. Was looking forward to seeing my kids on video. Sorry
1,The Road To Boredom,"Sadly, this book does not live up to its title. The story is hackneyed,uninspired and not very well thought out. In truth, the story line appears to have been thrown together during a coffee break. The writer, Jabari Asim, seems incapable of making the reader believe in the books characters .... for they appear dull, uninteresting and frankly, boring. This novel has obviously streched Mr Asim's limited capabilities as a writer to the limit ... and it clearly shows. I would not recommend this novel to anyone.I read this book whilst traveling on a long train journey. Next time I travel, I shall fly."
2,A pleasant surprise.,"A reluctant teacher loses her wealthy fiancé' and thus has to return to the job she hates. Desiring breast implants, she pursues the bonus awarded to the teacher whose class has the highest test scores. Along the way she is pursed by a gym teacher, tries to connect with a rich substitute, and finds a rival in a fellow teacher, the funniest and most well-developed character in the film. This is a movie that I found funny and refreshing, in that it is not laced with vulgarities and profanity throughout. This is a movie that provides laughs while not seeking the lowest common denominator. A pleasant surprise."
1,Very Disappointed,"I am very disapppointed with the performance of this electronic game. It was a little pricy to begin with for an electronic hand-held game and seems to be malfunctioning pretty often (I purchased it ""brand new"" about a month ago). I will be in the middle of a game & the system will clear itself completely & erase all of the points I have racked up. Needless to say it is quite frustrating. I replaced the battery on the mechanism, as I thought that may have been the problem, however it continues to malfunction. My suggestion would be to not purchase this item. Sincerely, Very Disappointed."
2,heartwarming and delicious,"I love short stories because I can read them before I go to sleep without losing a story line. After a helping of Chicken Soup for the Unsinkable Soul, I know I will go to sleep with good thoughts and hope and no fear of bad dreams. My favorite story is toward the end of the book, ""Hussy Sunsets"". My thanks go to Jack Canfield, et all for bringing joy and humor to my nightstand."
1,Boring...,SF by numbers.... if I'd wanted a trip through a (frankly unimaginative) jungle I'd have watched The Travel Show. Still...isn't it amusing to see another variation on the Me Tarzan You Jane scenario.
1,Disappointing...,"I had such high hopes for this book but was disappointed. It gives only a broad overview of pet-sitting and is absent of many specific, helpful details. If you are truly looking to start a pet-sitting business, I would pay a little higher price for a more thorough book!"
1,Good Product money wise but not Safe,"I am very much impressed with the quality of the Leather Pouch from my new Treo . I was very happy of the same . However While traveling as it was hooked to my trouser , my Treo fell down twice from this Pouch . As it does not have a Locking Facility , It creates a Problem . It has just a Magnetic flap which is of no use when your Expensive Treo Falls down Twice and has a Lot of Scratches on them . Hence if they would only have a Locking facility on the Flap it would be great."
1,So is this information believable?,"Received this book today. Started reading it in anticipation of my head gasket replacement. Noticed that the diagram for the 6-cylinder firing order doesn't match the text.Not sure if I can trust the rest of the information in this book, if they're not able to proofread it enough to catch this."
2,great books,"Anne McCaffrey is the quintessential writer of fantasy books pertaining to dragons. These books are always wonderful, well written, and perfectly characterized. All of her series are great but the ones that take place on Pern are the best of all."
1,Watch out for back cover!,"I ordered this book as a gift and found it completely unsuitable because of the photo on the backcover. The gift was intended for a father of 2 small children; he certainly would not want a book with a cover photo of a man with a vulgar word written on his forehead and making a vulgar gesture. Neither one of us is a prude, but this is something you don't want around children. I only wish that Amazon could let customers know what the back cover looks like in cases like this. I wasted money and time! I'm sure the inside content would have been interesting, but a coffee table book's cover--back AND front--need to be suitable for public consumption."
2,Fantastic!,"This is an awesome movie, a must watch for anyone tuning into their spiritual journey in this human experience. Much love and peace all... Enjoy!"
2,Great game!,This is a great and the service I received was great had no problems. I recommend this game to everyone.
2,RCA DCM425 DIGITAL CABLE MODEM (For Comcast) Review,The item came exactly as described in brand new condition. Extremely fast shipping and shipping material condition and application was perfect. This little item is saving us hundreds instead of renting a modem from Comcast. Not to mention is was 20$ cheaper than what they were selling one from them for!
1,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!!!!!,"A few months after we bought it it kept getting the ""paper jam"" error. Hp sent another refurbished printer. With a 90 day warranty. THe printer stopped working a few days after the warranty ran out. It wouldn't pull paper in at all. DON'T BUY IT, HORRIBLE QUALITY!!!!!"
1,Not Crichton's best work,"I found the story line had an interesting prospect, the fast and furious world of computer technology, meets the Jungle! Unfortunatly as I read more of the book the more bored I got. One of the few Michael Crichton books that I wouldn't recomend"
2,good book but beginners beware,This is a nice book for those of us who are familiar with Dreamweaver and web application development in general. Beginners may have a difficult time. The projects are decent and the code available for download is complete.
2,The Longest Day,"A wonderful classic, war movie. They don't make movies like this anymore nor do they have great actors like those in this movie. This is why I buy the older movies. Most remakes are horrid and the actors are worse."
1,"Organic it might be, but milk it is not","What sort of milk can sit on the shelf unrefrigerated for months? UHT or ultra-high temperature pasteurization, which enables this long shelf life, is an extremely harmful process to inflict on the fragile proteins of the milk. Broken down proteins are less useful for bodily growth and repair, and may even be regarded as hostile by the immune system. Do your research before buying any UHT milk. Here is a link to a study by the Weston Price foundation: [...]"
2,Good basic light dimmer,"Have this set to my smaller ceiling fan, worth putting it in and installing it, and most importantly it works well. One thing is that if you don't have any previous experience, installing this will be a hassle for you. Just be forewarned."
2,Can anyone answer this question????,"Is The Master Mariner the same as The Master Mariner Running Proud. Their reviews look the same, and I wonder if it's the same book published with different titles. Can someone help me?"
1,not the whole book,i am very very disappointed this is NOT the whole book i want a refund ....they should tell you its an abridged version
1,"""Royal R. Rife, Humanitarian, Betrayed and Persecuted""","I should have guessed by the name that this book was a poor substitute for a worthwhile read. Poor grammer, poor punctuation, poorly researched facts and skipped around without connection. The photos were appreciated, however."
1,The joke is on you...,"If you buy this surreally terrible piece of junk. Make your own version! Get blind drunk off of ripple wine with a friend, blow some herb, and tape the whole thing from the next room. A lot cheaper and probably a lot more artistically accomplished than this thing."
1,9 lbs? More like 3 lbs if you order from KEDcorp!,"There are a few different types of smoke wood listed on amazon with the same picture. I ordered apple and cherry chunks about three weeks ago. I assumed these were from the same company, but beware.. if you buy from KEDcorp you're likely to get ripped off!While this listing is for 9 lbs of wood, I only recieved a small, 3 lb bag in the mail. I contacted the seller, KEDcorp, who said they would look into it. It has now been over a week since that contact, and they have not responded back.There are other sellers here on amazon that you can buy apple wood chunks from, for a significantly better price per pound. I suggest supporting those sellers, who offer a better deal and are not false advertising. I won't be buying from KEDcorp in the future."
2,Zulu,"Endfield's breathless depiction of a rag-tag English force battling an implacable enemy remains one of our very best war films. Baker (who co-produced) was never better, and got his mystified Zulu extras to cooperate only after showing them an old Gene Autry Western, which helped them understand the nature of acting. In one of his final appearances, Jack Hawkins registers as a fanatical priest, and you can almost see the word ""star"" emblazoned on Caine's forehead. Like the heroes it portrays, the stellar ""Zulu"" richly earns a chestful of medals."
2,Just what I was looking for!,"This book is full of many wonderful ideas on how to achieve your own 'white' space. The effect is fresh and romantic, and somehow soothing. The images within are simply elegant. Lovely, and highly recommended!"
2,Excellent Resource,"This is such an excellent resource. As a former teacher and current mother who schools her children at home I have found this book useful. There is an introduction with examples of what has been done in the past and some of the types of students some of the reading methods this author has tried. There are many many resources available within this book. There are charts. There are analysis tools and more. There is a lot of information about some of the types of problems a person having reading difficulties might be having and specific ideas for each problem. For example, reading comprehension is different from oral reading is different from decoding etc. And each problem has it's own solution or set of suggested solutions that might help that specific problem.Well worth the money.Enjoy."
2,foreigner,"Foreigner is one of the best sci-fi books i have ever read it ranks right up there with Tad Williams series Otherland, which is excellent. I liked Foreigner so much because the plot, character development and pace are tightly wrapped, focused and never strays. The dialogue, intrigue and relationship between the Humans and Atevi characters is superb. The alien culture that C.J. Cherryh paints is wonderfully created; reminding one of Japans ancient warrior society and culture a parallel i don't know if was intentional or not but nicely done; demonstrated beautifully in the Atevi leader Tabini who is as Machevellian a character i have ever come across but also likable and juxapositioned most exellently with the human ambassador to the Atevi Bren Cameron. Exellent characters that you get to love and hate almost immediatetly, great intrigue, a smartly written intelligent witty novel.Verne Stewart."
1,Disappointed,This program is very buggy and I wish I did no even purchased and upgrade. Very disappointed
1,Huh? What am I missing?,I gave this lost classic a listen after tons of great reviews and boy was I disappointed. I just don't get it. It sounds like the ramblings or a schizophrenic. If I wanted that I would listen to Wesley Willis. I fail to see any genius in the material and I couldn't bear to listen for long. Unless you are fan of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys.... stay away. Unless you like to be tortured by music.
2,A Big Buzz,"""The Fly"" is one of the best written sci-fi stories ever told concerning the dangers of humankind's inherent impatience daring to play 'God'. Both movie adaptions of the story (starring David Hedison in 1958 and Jeff Goldblum in 1986) are well done. The first had a more Shakespearian slant as far as tragedy, since the protagonist had a long and loving marriage and a son he doted on. However, it lacked in the science application of melding two entities on a genetic level. The second, in my opinion, nailed the science of a gradual mutation of those entities, but it lacked the tragedy of the first, since the wife and son were now replaced by a girlfriend, which muted the tragedy effect. If someone could combine the best aspects of both adaptions, they'd have themselves one hell of a movie."
2,Awesome baby books!,"Colors, ABC's, counting, and animal sounds!These are amazing books, but so are pretty much all of the Boyton books! All my kids loved them!"
1,Poor Quality Rack,My wife and I received this as a wedding gift.The rack look nice and the spices seem to be of decent quality but the quality of the spice rack leaves much to be desired. The containers seem to be made of glass or a thick acrylic but the lids are made of cheap looking and feeling plastic. They also do not close well.The rack itself is also made of cheap feeling plastic and the spice containers fall off the racks occasionally.If I would have bought this I would return it. Look elsewhere
2,Great way to pass time,"Just reading the description, I wasn't sure this was meant for the PPC, but I took a chance and bought anyway. Turns out it works for both Palm and Pocket PC. It is great fun, and with the rebate, it is a great price. My only complaint is that the difficulty between easy and medium is a pretty big jump."
1,Skinned Deep Review,"This Horror movie stinks!!! It's nothing more then a cheesy Texas Chainsaw Massacre ripoff. The cast is bland & forgettable. The acting is fifth-rate. The dialogue is lame and weak at best. While it doesn't shy away from the blood & gore,most of the killings are pointless. The plot makes little to no sense. The only cool factor in this ripoff is Warwick Davis aka The Leprechaun but he fails to help the film in the long run. The most annoying part of the film is the end credits becuase instead of music,we get 4 minutes of a girl screaming ""NO NO"" over & over again. I give this movie a 1 out of 10."
2,Good read,Good story and characters the story gets better as it goes. Recommend this book to your friends.I would watch the movie.
1,Simply a waste!,"Ok, I wanted to get this album since I absolutely love 80's music! And since this was on sale, I jumped to get it! UNFORTUNATELY, there's a problem with it... NONE OF THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS ARE PLAYING THE SONGS! On the bottom of the album it says simply ""The Countdown Singers"". And plus, these remakes are in no way better than the originals, take ""Bad"" by legend Michael Jackson. ""The Countdown Singers"" have it all wrong.My suggestion? Don't waste your money on this, get an album with the original people doing their own music. True fans of such classics like ""Every Breath You Take"" or ""Addicted to Love"" would probably not appreciate the lower quality of these remakes."
1,Stop the broken record,"This books is no different from any other book written by McQuaig. This means that the private sector is always bad, and if only the right (read socialist) people were running the government we would have a utopia. Mcquaig would do some good if she thought through the implications of her own arguments, if she did she would realize that her main point is that wealth creation is bad and that a world where we were all equally living in poverty rather would be superior to one in which wealth inequality exists."
2,Really pleased,"We are extremely pleased with our nifty T-Fal tea kettle. We owned another brand which expired after we picked it up without turning off the contact switch. The contact on the new kettle is a simpler concept (though I wouldn't recommend disengaging it from its base before it is switched off either).Also the other brand had open coils that gathered ugly lime deposit which ended up in the coffee..uggg. Our T-Fal has coils tidily sealed by a stainless steel disc. A little vinegar and water cleans it off just fine.Love the temp control. Lots of times you might not want or need boiling water.Every feature exudes ""quality"".How great is it to get very quick hot water plus be able to carry your tea kettle any where without the constraint of an electric cord? This is a winner!"
2,Bruder Toy Man,My children have a few Bruder construction toys and they are all very well made. Although they are a little expensive they do last and take a great deal of abuse before they break. A small part on another toy broke and Bruder customer service was fantastic. They sent out the part at no cost and it was received quickly. You get what you pay for. The detail on the toys is also first rate. The toys will last a long time and can be used by other children (or grandchildren) when they get older.
1,Lightrelief Not Found,Light Relief Light TherapyLight Relief Infrared Pain Relief DeviceExtra Large Pad for Light Relief TherapyHave extensive use I found NO benefit from this device. I did give it a try. Another product sold using a movie star testamonial.
2,Happy gut,"Probio has kept me healthy even through antibiotics. I like that it has no allergens, as well. Small capsules are easy to take. Overall, I'm very happy with this product."
1,I'm not too sure about it.... Might just not be right for me.,"This book was recommended to me by my economics teacher. He seemed fairly optimistic about it, so I decided to read it for myself. He said it would help me recognize who I am, and help me identify and relate to others, but I honestly had a hard time keeping my interest up. It became too difficult to try to read more than three pages at a time, and I finally just gave up. I did not finish this book, but it was a bit too much of a boring read for me."
2,Nora at her best!,"I want these men!!! Nora Roberts has a talent for developing characters with depth and passion. The personalities that evolve are as real as the struggles they face, and handle. Wow!! Couldn't put it down until the end."
2,A Riot of a Book!,"One of McCarthy's hilarious travelogues about the world and the places he's been. In this tale, McCarthy searches for his history and namesakes spread far across the globe. He is specifically going after the supposed head of the McCarthy clan, and finds some very interesting characters along the way.McCarthy's sharp eye for detail makes the book go along well enough, but it becomes a howl when he describes just about everything in a style worthy of Monty Python.Things I have learned about the world through this book:1. I will never go to Tangier. Ever.2. Montserrat is a lovely place to visit, even though half the island was laid waste by a volcano and is now an ""Exclusion Zone.""3. Dublin should never be visited when England and Ireland play in rugby, or in any other sport for that matter.4. Butte, Montana should never be visited in winter.5. Alaska should be toured on roads that are covered in asphalt.A glorious look at the world and of us...!"
2,bill cosby millennium collection,"funny stuff but old so I have heard it before but Cosby is funny, i enjoyed it, and would recommend it."
1,"Good rice, but unreliable product: Keep your receipt!","I agree with most of the other reviews in that the rice is good when it gets cooked. However, this product is unreliable. The ""Cook"" button frequently pops up to ""Warm"" before the rice has finished cooking. Also, if you leave the rice on the ""Warm"" option for more than an hour or so, the rice on the bottom will burn. I cook rice appx twice a week and have had this machine for nearly 5 months - it just stopped working the other day with no obvious cause. I called the warranty hotline number and was informed that the problem is usually with the detachable power cord. Luckily I still have the receipt and this happened within the 1-yr warranty period, so they will replace it for me."
1,Bad buy,"In the last five years, Sony leads the industry in customer complaints and this product is in line with Sony's poor performance. The distortion level is so acute that it's impossible to enjoy a cassette, the CD does only slightly better. One wonders how anybody who likes music could be satisfied with this product. However, it is good for listening to news, and talk radio. The AM and FM reception is really good. But this one's not for anyone who likes music, even a child will be unhappy with it. Plus, the buttons are so poorly made that they fall off if you aren't careful."
1,"Good product, wrong size","The quality of this tarp is good, but the width was not as stated. I was able to add tie downs to my carport to compensate for the extra foot in width so I could get it tight across the frame work, but I could have done that with any local tarp purchased too."
1,sbv's have been discredited for false information,"it's rather sad that people have so much active hate for a guy who was a soldier. Kerry seems like a man who wants to make America good for Americans. He didn't deserve the ugly treatment from hostile men who weren't even on his boat. It's a shame when people are comfortable with forecfully hating a military man just because he doesn't share the same party politics. You don't have to want him for president, but to blindly believe lies and rage against a military person is sad. Will you line up at airports and ridicule men returning from Iraq who aren't Republicans? Disgraceful."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This is a terrible, horrible, mangled pile of plastic and metal that no person should ever touch. I hooked up 4 different component devices and every one looked awful. The picture was distorted and cut off, it jumped by about 20-30 pixels like it was vibrating, and the picture was in BLACK AND WHITE for two of them. However, since I used the 3 fiber-optic digital sound inputs instead of the RCA jacks, those actually transferred the sound signal. Whooo. This thing is very cheaply made and simply does not do what it should. Even the remote is a flimsy piece of garbage.I am completely dumbfounded as to how this product was actually designed, manufactured, and shipped to stores with these problems. Did NO ONE test it? This kind of lazy, careless craftmanship has taught me NEVER to buy anything made by Intec again. Please don't learn from your own mistake, learn from mine and don't buy this piece of garbage."
2,For the fans.,"This isn,t for all of you out there. Parents if your child is a fan of yu-gi-oh then sure a geat gift. I myself am a fan yeah yeah I know the dubbed over and clean cut is disappointing to the manga fans but its corporate america so there looking for an easier market. So enjoy what you can there are still some moment,s I quite enjoy Peagus and his presuite of his lost love with his twisted wit. And Kaibe and Yugis relationship reminds me of Vegeta and Gokus from Dragon Ball Z."
2,Most excellent,"I have this Cd and it is very good.. It's a very punky type of music and if you like to skank or mosh like me it's Tons O' fun..if you like LTJ ,rancid, NoFx or 88 fingers louie or that type of music you'll enjoy this cd"
1,honda repair manual,"this manual is not as well written as with the Haynes manuals, so it was rather useless as a repair manual, my recommendation is to always find a Haynes manual, too bad Chilton bought out Haynes, this particular manual is junk, don't buy it, I have 4 repair manuals for my 1988 Honda Accord LXi, I use all 4, but the best is the Shop Manual, second best is a Haynes manual, and the Chilton manuals are no good, especially for in depth work."
2,worth watching from start to finish,"saw this about 9 times on tvloved it more and more every timeshocking powerful action moviewith small bits of humorlike when Mason Storm gets down on his knees to look like he's playing fair with the robbers in the storeand he still kicks their ass regardless even while on his kneesnow that's funny and powerful. Lebrock is lusciously pretty and very talented. if you like Seagal see Marked for Death, Exit Wounds. and other great titles. I got this on dvd 2 days ago. it's worth the thrills, laughs and excitement every watchsee this movieif you like Kelly Lebrock, then see Weird Science. good and interesting movie"
1,Uncomfortable!,"I work retail and spend a minimum of 6 hours on my feet daily. By the end of a shift wearing these shoes my feet were killing me. They look nice and I like the thick soles. However, if you do a lot of walking, you will definitely find yourself regretting this purchase as I did."
2,Another Travis?,They remind me big time of the band Travis (whom I LOVE) but I really enjoyed this record. If you like music where you can just sit back and get into these cool and relaxed tunes then you'll dig this CD.
1,This KB is a P.O.S. Expected better from Saitek,"The only thing this KB has going for it is, it lights up.Even that is not great, the lighting is uneven and not nearly as bright as I would like it.This KB made for the gaming community, where Mountain Dew, Fat Tire Ale, Captain Morgan Private Stock Rum, Cheeto's, Pizza, and any other ungodly type of vice you can imagine are only inches away....DO NOT SPILL ANYTHING on this p.o.s. it is NOT made for a gamers environment, and if your careful and manage not to spill on it, FORGET ABOUT L.A.N. Parties, you can not guarantee safety in that social environment.My opinion, its an overpriced beer magnet, that can not withstand the environmental conditions for which it was marketed.Get something else."
2,Works pretty good,This gizmo works pretty good for simple hole drilling in round stock. It is a bit flimzy and not for precise holes.
2,Wild Man is in my Top Ten -- Unbelievable !!,"Wow, I didn't think Ms. Warren could ever top ""The Front Runner"". But then comes ""The Wild Man"". Truly an amazing book, neck-and-neck with Mary Renault's ""The Persian Boy"". The best words to describe this book are in her book itself, so get it and read it. And don't make the mistake of passing over the Author's Prologue -- this little bit at the beginning of the book sets the stage for the entire novel."
1,No more Marsden on Kindle for me.,"This is an excellent book for young adults, certainly the equal of the first volume in Marsden's series.Do not, however, think that the Kindle edition is the same as either the hardback or paperback edition. The quality control on the Kindle edition is appalling, there are so many spelling errors it is hard to believe it had even the most cursory of edits. If this is the quality that Amazon is prepared to sell on the Kindle then ebooks will never become popular.Buy the paperback, but not the Kindle edition."
1,Lame acupressure video,Very amateur video. Poor technique examples. Pointless. Waste of time and money.
2,the book you want,"If you're looking for one cookbook to help you prepare healthy meals for your baby, toddler or young child, this is the book! It has lots of meals, combinations of foods, easy directions and great pictures. Even if you have a picky eater, there are so many ideas in this little book that hopefully at least a few will work for you...."
1,Skylink AD-433S Emergency Dialer,Instructions are marginal; fortunately I am technical enough to read. Big problem for me is that it will not dial over my VOIP line but that was never stated in product specs (that I could find). I don't know whether it is design relatd or defective dialer. I use Vonage system. Do not recommend purchase.
2,Very good story....++++,...saw it years ago when i was a kid...and still i enjoyed seeing it again...great story line....Recommend to any war movie buff....
2,"If made right, it's a perfect drink...","I mix a scoop of Perfect Food with a banana and orange juice with ice in the blender everyday.. it tastes good, it gives you solid veggie and fruit servings, and it wakes you up a little as well... pricey but worth it if you are serious about your health..."
1,"It was many things, but scary, it wasn't.","I will give it 2 starts just because it obviously interested enough people to make not one, but two movie versions. I am not surprised at all, however, that especially the second movie is very different from the story told in this book. This book certianly is not scary and is not really even about a haunted house. It seems to be more of a psychological thriller, but not even a very good one. THe last couple of chapters are completely disjointed from the rest and they make no sense whatsowever, and the end is a tru disappointment, as many questions are left unanswered. I think the book tried to make Hill House one of the characters, but it miserably failed. I really feel like I wasted time on this book. I can't believe how it can be considered a haunted-house classic, when the house itself does not do much at all."
2,hell yeah!!!,"This album is great. I think it will be a classic. I was wondering myself, where has B.G. been? this album answers that question. i cant wait for some more music to drop from chopper city records."
1,oops,"I was really disapointed with this CD. I bought it because I really liked the first song and expected more songs to be like it, I was wrong."
2,dream house,Got here in good time and looked to be in good shape. Can;t wait to watch it again. Such a good movie. You should give this one a try!
1,Amazon isn't aware of OS compatibility,This software was listed as being compatible with Linux. It isn't. I have ordered other software for Linux that was actually specified as operating only with Windows. Apparently nobody understands software and as a result I have a couple programs purchased from Amazon that totally unusable. I will never purchase software from Amazon.com
1,And they say Bratz aren't realistic.,"There is no way a hot tub, and a drink bar could fit in that tiny limo. And they copied the Bratz dolls again. They have a limo now, and they copied the drink bar and hot toub from the Bratz bus. My Scene dolls aren't that realistic either. They become models, Go to Miami and Jamacia and Hollywood. And they get to be in a movie. That stuff is definatly not realistic. That could never happen to a real girl. My Scene dolls suck and Bratz rule."
1,The author must be a Demacrat,"I would rate this book a zero star! This book is very biased and politically timed to try to tear this country apart. Very, much the same way the Ku Klux Klan worked there propaganda. Kitty Kelly? you have any Klan members in your family closet????Kitty Kelley, you should do a book on yourself. Point that high powered reporting at your life. The Bush Family have earned all they have gotten. What, would you do, if your father was President? Or if your son? If you have a son.I doubt your book, will help the other party. But, you will make money and have made it, already. Thats the bottom line. Your are in it for the money. LOL Its funny, you slam the rich, but while your doing the slamming. You my dear are making money!!!!!alot of it, being Number 1 on Amozon.com.But, Tabloids are Number 1 at Walmart too."
1,Piece of Junk,"Installed this on a new build and immediately the fan started spinning loudly and to think this unit is supposed to keep things quietly. The following day, the system would not boot up at all due to a Thermal Control Module (TCM) that went bad overnight. I tried calling CoolIt Systems technical support line and someone is supposedly calling me back. Well, I been waiting for over a week now and still no return call. Will try again."
2,Pyrex Accents 4-Piece Bakeware Set,This is a very nice baking set .I would buy them again. They are nice and heavy and have the grip handles to help you carry the dish. Real nice.
2,Amazing!,"I had to read Alas, Babylon for an English class. I thought that it was going to be another boring Sci-Fi book which I could never understand. But Alas, Babylon hooks you at the begining till the very end! I absolutely loved this book! This weekend, the class was just suspose to read Chapters 1 and 2, but I could not put it down!!Alas, Babylon really makes you think about the Cold War, espiecally if you did not live during that time.This is an amazing book that I think anyone could enjoy!"
1,Too Predictable,"This is the first novel I've read by this author, and it might be the last. I've had this book in my collection for awhile, so I finally decided to pick it up. However it might have been better off continuing to collect dust.I found it hard to stick with it in the beginning and there were a few instances when I back tracked a few pages, wondering if I had missed something, for when I read into some action I was like, 'Whoa, where did this come from.' The characters were too flat and all over the place with their actions and opinions/beliefs. As in my headline, the plot was also too predictable and there was only one instance where I was taken by surprise; read this near garbage of a novel if you want to know what that is (about 2/3's the way through).I will likely be wary of this author in the future. Hopefully something out there in her collection of 20 books can redeem her somewhat."
1,Trite Pretense in Action,"I liked Tarantino's Natural Born Killers and Pulp Fiction.I rented this because it starred Uma Thurman and I love samurai movies.Too bad this and part 2 are PRETENTIOUS trash. As I watched some scenes unfold, I was actually embarassed for Quentin."
1,not user friendly,It's complicated to use this LCD monitor/tv. It's TV tuner to receive channels is very bad and it's instruction to correct the situation is non-existence.
1,thumbs down,"I've docked this book a star for its awkward, unprofessional prose and another star for its frequent mangling of musical matter. For that matter, it doesn't seem to know who or what it's for. Its tone is patronizing. It contains no original thought or substance. If you are content with abbreviated, non-contextual (and therefore, in my opinion, virtually meaningless) explanations, you'll be happier with a pocket music dictionary Prefer music books written--with the television set off--by practicing musicians.(By the way, it appears that this book has not been edited. Among its typographical errors appears this curiosity: ""quartal"" is misspelled as ""cuartal"" throughout. Hmm...well, ""cuartel""--with an ""e""--is Spanish for ""quarter""....)"
2,Mariah & Aretha were outstanding,"This is one of the best mixture of diva power. In order, the best performers were Mariah Carey, Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion, Gloria Estafan, and Shania Twain. The best songs were My All, Make It Happen, and Chain Of Fools (which was the best) This album is worth buying.PS: whoever wrote the review who said Mariah's voice was fading away, and Celine had a 5 octave voice, was lieing"
2,bright candles shines,I have read many books before. I thought this one is a very very good book. It keeps you entertained and has a lot of suspense from beginning to the end. It never gets real slow in parts unlike some books. The book is very realistic and is a historical fiction book. The only thing that I have against it is the details lag and it sometimes skips a month or two between chapters. I do however recommend this book to read. It is very interesting to read.
1,Garbage,"This is probably one of the worst things I have every gotten.I was trying to improve signal strength and it appear and the antenna would be helpful. The signal strength of this thing is pitiful. I had better signal with a cheap usb adapter than with this. Plus setup is difficult. When you get it set up there is no way to save your selection as to whether to have their software or windows manage the connection. Every time you do anything with your connection there is a pop up which asks you if you want Netgear or Windows to manage your connection. This thing is going back. By the way, I bought it through a brick and mortar store but I want to warn anyone on Amazon who was thinking of buying this. The name Rangemax is a joke."
1,Absolutely Horrible Book - No Story Line,"This is the absolute worse book of the series. It is like one long bad weekend of bed hopping. LKH has forgotten to tell a story along with her belt notching for bed partners. Anita doesn't know what she is doing half the time, and what has LKH done to Richard? The only thing remaining from previous books is Jean Claude's obsession with putting together the perfect outfit. This book is a waste of money, go to the library, borrow it or just skip it. Not worth the time. Maybe LKH needs a little bed time, then maybe she could write about Anita again with some substance and, je ne sais quoi, purpose."
1,Watch out Mac G5 owners ....,"I just got a Mac G5 with 2 GB of RAM and was looking forward to using this product. I would have to agree that from the book most of the clipart contained in this set is cartoonish, but my worst complaint is that I just couldn't install it. On install all you'll get is a window stating you don't have enough RAM and fail to continue.Nova Development software support wasn't any help either. They were VERY familiar with the problem and the tech made it clear that a fix would NOT be coming out anytime in the near future. He immediately gave me the phone # to call and get a refund ... and I'll use it."
1,Made for a man... :(,"Created for long manly fingers, which I do not have, I have small girly hands and although I did keep it since I desperately needed it I found myself re-adjusting the set up over and over, I just never got comfortable with it. The programing is insane, I tried to figure it out but just could not. When they mean this item is adjustable they mean ONLY the thumb pad is, kinda deceiving since it looks like you could also adjust the base and make it shorter, not so. the 4 top keys are too far for me to reach and the little joystick gets in the way more than anything. Also after 3 months of use the keys are really starting to look worn but have remain kinda hard to push. Keys 20/21 are a total mystery to me. I will say if you are good with programming keypads, if you have long fingers and you play very hard it should be right for you."
2,I actually enjoyed it.,"I was really suprised to see the negative reviews. I am currently enjoying the album. It's different from the old stuff but it is still great. I actually like the ""Filler Song"" Given Up, it's rather catchy. But to each there own I guess."
1,not happy,"this came to me beat up, the package looked like it was open and very dirty. not satisfied.i thought the item was new, it wasnt it looked like someone returned. then you sold it to me."
2,The best of the bunch,"I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I've read the gamut of parent self-help books and found this one to be the most uplifting and practical. I deal with a difficult 86 year old, narcissistic mother who has had many recent illnesses and crises. Barbara and Grace's book gave me the insight and advice needed for me to get past my anger and confusion and start setting limits for my mother while providing her support. It helped me enormously. After reading the book, I also found myself needing care management services for my mom. I'm lucky to be living in the Washington, DC area and was able to use the author's care management services when my mother had emergency surgery and needed 24 hour home help. Barbara is as wonderfully empathetic in person as she is in her book. She helped in both understanding and helping me manage my mother as my mother moved through her latest crisis. I don't think I couldn't managed easily without her help."
2,Forget the white wedding dress!,"I loved this book! Having my two best friends planning ""traditional"" weddings at the same time, I was wondering... isn't there anything else out there? It's ""Anti-Bride Guide"" to the rescue. It's a great book filled with tons of ideas for a great wedding. Tha authors offer all kinds of practical information for the bride to be. They also manage to keep you laughing through out the book. Not only that, but it felt great to know that I was not alone in my quest for a nontraditional wedding. I immediately showed this book to my boyfriend=)(He thought I was crazy for not wanting a white wedding dress)"
2,Awesome!,"This book is the best book I have read in a long time. It is a very difficutlt read because of subject matter, but the book is riviting. I loved it. I have since read a few other books of this author and I highly recommend you check them out as well."
2,Great book,"I received this book as a gift, and subsequently purchased for a friend. The advice is practical, and the book isn't preachy. My 15mo old routinely uses 10 basic signs (milk, eat, pain, sleep, etc.), and I think our lives are much better for it. Instead of crying or shouting, she can ask for what she wants. I can't compare to other books, because I haven't read any, but sign language has been a very positive thing for our family, and we were successful using the advice in this book."
2,A tinker toy type collectible card game.,"If you have an interest in pirates, collectible card games or shipbuilding, you'll want to pick up a booster pack or two of this game.Each booster comes with 2 ships, 9 coins and 2-3 crew cards. This box set comes with 7 ships plus coins and crew cards. It's entirely possible to play with 1 booster pack, but once you get hooked you'll want more.Each 'card' has parts that can be punched out and that slide fairly easily together to build 3D ships. My only complaint is with how easy it is to break some of the pieces. Make sure you grip tightly the very bottom of sails when trying to install them. Thankfully some super glue works wonders with broken sails.I highly recommend the game as its fun to build and collect all the little ships and the game is simple and fun to play as well."
2,Very glad I purchased this,"I thought long and hard about whether or not I wanted to pay for something that should already be included with my video iPod. I have to say that if it had been more expensive, I probably wouldn't have purchased it. Bottom line...I love the fact that I can listen to the radio on my iPod video. I haven't had a single problem and I use it every single day. If you really miss the radio but can't live without your iPod, you won't be sorry buying this. I would recommend it."
2,Better than my old alarm,"Similar to the old Kidde alarm we had, but this one seems easier to operate. The great thing was it fits on the same frame as the old one, saving me work."
2,"A great read for readers hungry for facts, not speculation","This volume is a cornerstone of any Titanic collection. Those who wish to explore the innumerable 'what ifs' of the disaster will be better off elsewhere, but there isn't a more dispassionate, detailed and vivid recounting of the Titanic's construction, voyage and demise. Crammed with facts, the text is brought alive by page after page of very evocative pictures. The authors tell the story very straight and avoid much of the lurid speculation common to others, but for a great read that puts you right on the great liner, this book serves well."
1,Sister Lovers/CD Hater,"""Third/Sister Lovers"" by Big Star is, quite possibly, the worst cd I have ever heard. There is not one song worth listening to. I played the cd twice (figuring it couldn't be as bad as I suspected after the first listen) and it was worse the second time around. It sounds like something a bad high school band would have recorded in their basement. While I was a fan of Alex Chilton and the Box Tops, with the exception of the song September Gurls, Big Star seems to be a product of myth and the hype machine. Other than the aforementioned September Gurls, Big Star didn't have one song on their three albums that would have been an AM radio hit. It's no wonder that a major recording studio didn't pick them up. The band sounds as if they are stoned throughout the recording. It's disjointed, poorly mixed and the songs are horrible. George Martin himself couldn't have done anything with these tunes. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this dreck. What more can I say."
2,Problems with these speakers fixed,I'm no audiophile but the sound coming out of these is just fine for me. They look really sweet too.It's really really important you take a very close look at the connectors for the two tiny satellite speakers.The plastic surrounding the 3.5mm jack on one is square and the other is triangular and they ONLY fit in the correct recepticle on the back of the subwoofer. If you put them in the wrong recepticle and in the wrong rotation then they won't push all the way in and you will have no sound.I've just spent an hour thinking mine were bust and I suspect every other one of the problems on here are the same thing.Good luck guys!
2,Lou Holts.. Greatest speaker of my life time,"Lou Holts speaks from the heart, speaks the truth and makes a believer out of everyone. I have seen im in person and read/listen to some of his books. This man is a true inspiration for all man kind."
1,dumb,"I liked the idea of this movie how it was about Idaho and the way the wolves came here 20 years ago, but the movie itself is dumb. Im glad I didn't pay for it. it was free on prime."
2,This is the best rap cd that I have ever heard!,"I love this cd! My favorite song is ""Jigga my Nigga"" by Jay-Z. Jay-Z is a great rapper. Eve isn't too bad either."
2,High Quality,"Very well made vest. Rugged, loaded with pockets. Can carry a lot of gear comfortably and you don't look like to much of a weirdo if you wear it in town. One thing I will point out that I wish someone else had noted before I bought this vest is that it is very short. Stops right at the waistline so if you are looking for a vest to conceal a hip holster this isn't the one but you could easily carry inside one of the many pockets. I am still happy with my purchase."
1,"Not erotic, not art","In this film one of the characters is described by his mother as a shallow fashion-seeker, which effectively sums up this entire film. There is an attempt to be visually artistic,and a pretentious attempt to integrate the story into the framework of a reknown Japanese classic work of erotic literature, but nothing saves this film from sinking under its own weight. The acting is wooden and unconvincing throughout. The scattered story-line is an alarming descent into the degrading sexual exploitation of a mentally unbalanced and confused young woman . The editing is sloppy with scenes actually out of order which you might not notice at first, since, as there is no discernable point to the story, the film dissolves into a set of obscure, disassociated and self-conscious scenes of joyless sex. You can have more fun doing your taxes than watching this film."
1,Don't waste your time.,"When I want to read a history book then I will pick up a history book to read. If I want to read a romance book then that is what I will pick up to read. This is a history book in the disguise of a romance book-and not a very good one at that. It is very diconnected, very hard to get through. I was very dissapointed."
2,Definately a must buy,"Originally heard this album on MP3, heard 2 songs and bought the damn thing. It has a groove u can't describe with words. Yes i agree with one of the other reviwers that the drummer is good, but the Best ever? please. I can name 10 off the top of my head who far outclass. Charlie Benante for 1. Anyway...this album reminds me of Deftones - Adrenaline with the groove, vocally i like the way he can go from melodic to down-right scary in a heartbeat.Get it"
1,Family Film? No WAY!!!,"I bought this based on other reviews saying what a great family film this is. Hah! The language is foul. The early scenes have teens having beer parties ect. The rotten language is all through this film. The animals are so obviously phony that you'll laugh yourself silly. The acting is awful. The plot is boring. If you're looking for a beautiful outdoor wilderness film,I advise that you keep on looking...elsewhere.A Concerned Christian Mom"
2,Love the series - but disappointed from the length,"I saw this series when I was 17 yrs. I tried to search for it via internet, was happy to find it here, but got disappointed from the length which cut so many good parts!This DVD shows the basic/important events ... wish if it include longer parts of the engagement."
2,"A great ""who done it"" and ""who's next?"" !","This Father Koestler murder is a great read! Not only does the mystery itself keep you hopping, the anecdotes about the church and its very human population provide an interesting backdrop for the action that all of Kienzle's books share. I strongly recommend it (but don't be too disappointed if you don't figure out the puzzle ahead of the famous father)!!"
1,Turd-tastic,"If you actually think that this is an intelligent, well-made, non-gimmick-laden film with real insights into drug addiction about actual flesh and blood characters that you can empathize with, you are an idiot.Up there with Dancer in the Dark in the running for most outrageuosly over-rated and pretentiously God-awful movie EVER.Masochists may get a kick out of it..."
1,The only Dagliesh book I do not like,"I am a huge fan of PD James and Adam Dagliesh, but this book just did not work for me. The characters were unappealing, the plot was unbelievable. I normally love mysteries that are slow-paced and build to a climax, and normally you can count on PD James for this type of mystery, but not this time. The book was boring, by the end I found myself wishing I hadn't wasted my time. It was so disappointing."
1,Trashy - but cute and fun trashy,"Johnnie Cochran meets ET. A dime store novel that is fun and light, if not kind of dumb. If you can suspend belief and just take it for worth, you'll like it. If you want deep and real, go elsewhere. If you can believe that if aliens come to this planet the biggest problems we'll have is a murder trail and if Oprah or Barbra Walters will interview them, then go for it. I like Sawyer and I admit, I like this cheesy book.AND - HEY AMAZON - GET A HALF STAR ON THESE RATING. I really want to give this 2 1/2 stars."
2,Pullin,"This CD has incredible energy. Good music, good dancing and great fun listening. I've given this CD to many of my friends."
1,counterfeit?,"the batteries barely held a charge. One to three photos per charge. Took to an authorized Nokon repair center. They checked my camera, charger, and the batteries. I was told that these were extremely close counterfeits."
1,"A Little Background Music, Please","The goal of this cassette is to assist pregnancy and childbirth with relaxation techniques and guided mental imagery.Relaxing it is not. The sound quality is poor, doing nothing to diminish the pops, hisses, and breathing inherent in recording the human voice. There is no background music to help with this either. I found both the pitch and inflection of the speaker's voice to be extremely unnerving and annoying. Several times, the speaker becomes VERY loud and screechy, ruining any hope of relaxation and jolting the listener into a heightened state of tension. This is not the recommended way to end a self-hypnotic state.With a professional speaker, a good sound mixer, and a little music, I think the guided imagery would be very helpful and I intend to use it in conjunction with other tapes I will be listening to. However, I can't see myself packing this particular cassette off to labor and delivery."
1,Too Much Like Work,"If I want to read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century, then I read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century. This boring, pretentious, rambling, self-involved, pontificating mess passes itself off as fiction, but it reads like one of those junior-high assignments where students are told to imagine themselves living in another time or place. How on earth it could have received a National Book Award is a mystery, even considering the spotty reputation of the award. One or two times I began to feel swept up in the narrative (I appreciated Bogdan's journal entries, his unrequited pining for lovely young boys), but quickly enough that narrative flow was dammed by another lengthy, boring letter or monologue. I would refer those who want to read a masterful book about an eastern European artist coming to America in the nineteenth century to read Josef Skvorecky's 'Dvorak in Love'. Now there's a book!"
1,Waste of Money,It wasn't too expensive and it was as dull as a butterknife. I could not shave with it. I tried to sharpen it but it didn't work. There was no one in my area that knows how to sharpen them and I didn't want to pay $70 for a hone since I was fearful it still wouldn't work. It was a total loss.
1,Don't buy this book!,"Last year for Calc AB, I relied mostly on my notes nd managed to get a 4. This year my teacher was horrible nd I actually tried to use this book to review BC material nd I could not understand it. I think I got a 3 or 4. The questions are way too difficult. Also, you can tell this book wont help you when you look to the explanation to understand a question and it gives a one sentence answer which means nothing. I used barrons for my SAT I math and got a 790. Most of its books are good, but this one surely isnt. You're better off with the Arco, CliffsAP, or even Princeton review. anything but Barrons!"
2,Little People! Big Fun!!!,"This is a Christmas gift for my 5 month old son, so far it looks so much fun, I love all the Fisher-Price little people. I know know my 2 year old is going to play with this more. Overall it is a beautiful toy."
1,Boring - Couldn't follow at all,"I dislike this book. I couldn't even finish it. I guess the plot was ok. I just could not follow the book at all. he only thing I got out of the 4.5 chapters that I read was that the main character is a gold digger and she has ""a friend"" that wants to be more than friends but he doesn't make enough money for her. Andddddddd ... She was dating a married man without knowing he was married."
2,Spill proof indeed,"I absolutely tested this product with cold water by swishing it back and forth and slowly turning it upside down. No leaks! I did notice however after washing it, it caught water under the metal exterior and the water would trickle out for some time. That shouldn't count though. As long as I never ruin another purse or laptop by tipping over the thermos, I am satisfied."
1,STOP TRYING TO HIDE PETER GABRIEL'S ERA !!!!!!!,"Who the hell is behind this fraud?. First was that pointless and unforgivable 3 CD collection, filled with mostly Collins POP-GENESIS era, and just the 3rd disc (excellent but totally incomplete, missing statements as Dancing With The Moonlit Knith, Get'Em Out By Friday, Watcher Of The Skies, The Return of the Giant Hogweed, The Fountain of Salmacis, In The Cage, Seven Stonres, Looking For Someone, etc).Now this insult for the long-time fans. A complete excrement. Even it's offensive for both our memory and Gabriel's. Stop praising the crappy 80s era and release a DVD of the Peter Gabriel's era AT LAST !!!. It's not secret at all that there're several films from 1972 onwards, Brussels 1972, NBC studios ""Midnight Special"" 1973, the famous Shepperton 1973 concert, University Sports Arena 1974, ORTF TV Studios 1974, The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway 1975 DVD, etc.Peter Gabriel was the genius of Genesis. PERIOD.We REALLY need a DVD from Gabriel's era instead."
2,A good overview.,"I read this book, along with Entsminger's Tao of Objects, when I needed to gain a good ""technical lay person's"" understanding of object-oriented technology. Though I've since done some rudimentary programming to hammer home the key concepts, I recommend both books."
2,A Great Diamond Mystery,"Lovesey's latest Peter Diamond mystery is, not surprisingly, good. Diamond, still recovering from his wife's death is brought in to investigate the murder of a Bath woman. As the woman was involved in the investigation of a serial killing, Diamond is gradually roped into that as well, bringing both cases to conclusion.What I liked a lot about the novel and the series is the ongoing character development we see from book to book. Ingeborg, the journalist turned policewoman we met in a previous novel is a fresh new addition, together with Hen--Diamon's counterpart from the beach town where one of the murders occured. I will strongly recommend this book to fans of police procedural series."
2,Good Southern Rock,"If you like Southern Rock, you'd like this one. It has some great new songs that any fan of the genre would like. Special guest Charlie Daniels on the song ""Gypsy Trail""."
1,"Primitive, rough, malleable, and cheap","Bends quite easily, and has rough edges. It even arrived bent, and I had to bend it back with my hands to (approximately) straight.The GreatNeck 11059 Aluminum Rafter Angle Square may be low cost, but that's all it's worth."
1,"Good build-up, Bad let-down!","The first half of the movie builds up a great story. The Jackal is a hired assassin who is paid millions of dollars to assassinate a well-known personality in the USA. He is able to go undetected all over North America using aliases, disguises and stolen identities. He has a carefully crafted plan that involves an automatic firing weapon controlled remotely via a laptop. Bruce Willis plays a very believable villain.However, the ending was so bad that the whole plot blows up like a poorly made B-movie! Unfortunately, it makes the two hours not worth watching!"
2,Into The Wilderness,Into the Wilderness by Sara Donati love the series but when I checked the price at the time I read the sample the price was $$4.49 Now it is listed at $10.14 Also Dawn on a Distant Shore was listed at $6.39 now is $$10.14. The entire series is now quite a bit more money than when I first checked it out. Anyone know why or who can give me some answers. Ihave read the first two books & they are excellent.
1,New WaterPic Flosser tips,Ours were also in the strips of 15 and they are not the same quality as the earlier product pictured. These bend too easily and are not even good for a single flossing. Bring back the old tips in the 30 pack.
1,Rookie mistakes from veteran authors,"Fans of the authors' other books or of the original tale will be very disappointed by this story. It seems to me that these authors made a huge rookie mistake: assuming that the reader knows everything about the universe their story takes place in.There's no transition from the original story, no background information, and the plot just dives in with no real cohesive feel of the setting, characters, or events that occur. I recognized terms and names from the original, but it all lacked definition. Even the characters seemed flat and undeveloped.They may have been living, breathing, dissecting minutiae, and agonizing over the story for weeks together, but we haven't been let in on any of it.Oh well, even top-notch authors are allowed a stinker once in a while."
1,Bo-ring!,"This movie was really...stupid. I guess if you really like softcore porn, this would be perfect, since that's what it is. But keep in mind, it doesn't show ""anything""; it's like watching naked people make out, and that's it. It was fun to watch and laugh at with my friends, with the bad acting and all."
2,Fingersmith,"What a wonderful book! If you like Victorian novels that twist and turn with wonderful prose, you will love this book. It is reminiscent of a Dickens novel with lots of plot twists, memorable characters, and atmospheric writing so vivid you will be looking for a scarf to protect yourself from the foggy London weather! Sarah Waters is one of the best of the new writers, and I've enjoyed all of her books. If you need an escape for a few hours, buy this riveting book and learn about the underworld of London in Victorian times."
1,Returned Unit,Speed was terrible. No matter how much I tried to reconfigure the settings I couldn't get to function properly. Returned router within 2 weeks.
2,"Good solid, INXS album","Not sure if I would rate it the best or not. Most of their albums in this period are of similar caliber in my opinion, all great. This one does have my favorite song by them though. Love Is (What I Say) is one of my favorite songs of all time. So powerful...RIP Michael"
1,Wish it was better,We have been using this car seat for 6 weeks now and I wish I hadn't picked it out because of its name. It's not very comfy for him. I always have trouble opening the canopy without it comming off the back. The straps don't pull out easily and I always have a hard time with my sons arms. I don't have trouble getting it out/in the base. It's very light weight.
1,A Weighty Achievement!!,This book is a well rounded collection of Rush's comments on a vast number of topics. The enormous girth of the man's intellect is evident as he expounds upon various heavy issues such as the economy and the environment. A steady diet of Rush's writings will enlarge one in may ways.
1,Not a good read,This book will leave you confused about RF design if you are new to it. However if you are quite familiar with the RF design you probably don't need this book. Then who is this book for I wonder? There are no mathematical details not are their enough intuitive details.
2,Breeze to the top,"I searched for a high chair for a long time.......... a long long time. This one by far was overall the best one.Here is what I looked for:1) Easy adjustments of height of the chair AND the chair back2) Sturdiness of the high chair3) Durability of the seat cushionThe Breeze was the best in all these areas.The chair back is easily to adjust, I believe it has 4 settings.The height was easy to adjust as well.The chair is a bit heavy, approx 26 lbs, but I was okay with this cause I wanted a high chair that will last a few years as the kid grows.The seat cushion is by far the best feature. It is removable from the high chair itself, so we can throw it in the wash.Overall, I am very satisfied."
1,How did this junk get published?,"First, let me answer my own question--he wrote for David Letterman and Letterman endorses the book on its cover which guarantees at least some sales. What it doesn't guarantee is that the book is well written, funny, or the least bit entertaining. It isn't even marginally any of these things. The Ringer is a few one liners pieced together into a novel consisting of poorly conceived, completely unrealistic, exaggerated characters with nothing interesting to say. ""College Boy"" carrying around ""Bagzilla"" avoiding conflict with ""the Dirt King"" while ""Uncle Mort"" plays golf in the hospital. Ridiculous, unfunny drivel that amounts to a torturous, unfunny read."
1,Sharing the Misery,"I picked up ""1185 Park Avenue"" looking forward to insight on growing up Jewish on Park Avenue in the 1940's/1950's. Instead I found myself drawn into Anne Roiphe's remarkably dysfunctional family, where no individual escapes unscathed from this hellish home. I found the memoir to have no redeeming message or purpose, except to let Ms. Roiphe express her rancour at her unfortunate circumstances. What bothers me most is that in becoming so engaged in the sadness and anger of her family story, these negative vibes served to make me upset too. Another triumph of evil over redemption."
2,One of the Best Ever,"This is the way a children's book should be. The artwork is lush, the story heart breaking, and the concept and central theme is enough to touch an adult perspective as stronly as a child's view. The tale is simple: A swan falls in love with a touring boat carved in the shape of a swan, and refuses to give up on his unrequited love no matter what the consequences. The ending will leave even adults with a sense of the wonder and the sense of loss that true emotions reveal. This story revolves around what love really is, and how much we would be willing to give up for it."
2,Windflame Candles,"We love the candles, we light them on Christmas eve for our gone relatives. AWESOME,but could only buy three therefore had to pay shipping. Still an Awesome product and will purchase again!!!!!"
1,Ugh...,"This is really a horrible dvd...its a whole bunch of clips that leave you hanging.... you dont know whats going on the whole time, and its 19 3 or 4 minute tracks of different misc. video clips. most of these are choppy and at horrible angles....it should be titled ""The Real World You Didnt Want To See"" Its really pointless. Plus all the nudity is still blocked...for those who were anxious to know...."
2,Gunsmoke-50th,"I really like this DVD set purchased from Amazon. It was delivered in a hurry and the picture quality is very good. The set also has some very good extras including an interview with ""Miss Kitty""."
2,worth its weight in gold,"i've used a wireless mouse for several years now and when my old one (a pretty basic microsoft model) finally died, i saw this one and read the reviews and took the plunge. i absolutely love it. i am a digital photographer and spend most of my waking hours at the computer in photoshop. the accuracy of this mouse truly is remarkable! i use it on a wooden desk that has been sanded ultra-smooth and the mouse does not miss a beat (or drift like my other one). the rechargable base was also a primary factor in the buying decision as i am tired of buying batteries. finally, this thing is really comfortable, allowing my whole hand to rest on it and not the table. and it really glides smoothly over the surface of the tabletop. i haven't found anything to complain about..."
2,Makes pulse diagnosis easy for anybody,I Realy enjoyed this book. It makes pulse diagnosis acceessible to anybody even without a lot of experience. Very clear and sharp distinctions are made between the different pulses. The writer shares his experience which realy helps.
2,Versatile as possible,"I put this switch into a 1976 Fender Strat. It fit perfectly even though the switch is considerably wider than the original. Wired it up and it works flawlessly. Action is a bit stiff, but hasn't had much use yet.This is a 4-pole 5-throw (position) switch that can access nearly all of the wiring positions possible on your guitar. Here are two wiring examples. For two humbuckers, connect lead #1 to hot, lead #4 to ground then leads #2 and #3 to the poles (repeat for the other pickup). This provides a simple way of getting any in-phase combination of humbucking or parallel from all four coils. For three single coils, wire lead #1 of the neck pickup to hot and lead #2 of the bridge pickup to ground. Connect the other four wires to the poles of this switch and get nearly any combination of parallel and humbucking you desire."
2,no problems with XP,"I've had only positive experiences with my 1440, and while running under XP. I just downloaded the latest driver from the Brother website and didn't seem to have any problem. Yes, when you switch to 300dpi or toner save mode, the resolution is not the best, but given the overall quality of the printer, its ease of operation and the price (otherwise known as bang for the buck), I have to give it five stars. The HL 1440 is especially a good option if you're sick of paying more for printer cartridges on inkjets than on the actual printer."
2,AT LAST!!!!!,"I held by breath for eight years and finally I can exhale. I consider this CD to be a platinum effort by Sade and a welcome relief from other disappointing R&B offerings out there. This CD rocks with sparse albeit deep lyrics, jammin' beats and the raw sensuality that is Sade. BUY THIS CD! You will not regret it."
2,Easy Reading for English Class,"I am a junior in AP English, and for class we had to choose a non-fiction or auto/biographical book from a list our teacher had supplied. I chose this book because of an essay we had read by Ms. Walker in class. I loved it! It was very witty, yet I learned about the black culture and black artists. I actually enjoyed reading a book for class, and recommend this book for anyone who is interested in reading and learning!"
2,THIS CD RULES!!!,"this cd is so awesome. me and my friends love it.i think they all are really h-o-t-t hot. A.J. is da bomb. i love all the songs on this cd and normally that doesn't happen. well, i would tell everyone go get this one or there new one. thanxs.."
1,Buyer Beware,"Beware! although the information on the sale site clearly states that the product is great for campfires when I received the popper there was a large type sticker on the box stating ""For Decoration Only - Not For Actual Use"".I will be returning this item."
1,Commercial Line???,"When I read a product with ""commercial"" or ""contractor"" I think its more powerful then the normal homeowners equivalent of the same brand. This product was worse then the normal homeowners kind I had to buy from Target after this didn't clear my drain. I saw slight improvement and thats why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Don't pay extra for this product."
2,Great Game,"It's a great game if your looking for a game with great graphics and entertaining gameplay. Fun game to play over and over again. Great for kids, mario and luigi fans, and anybody who wants a fun E rated game."
2,Testament of durability.,"I haven't worn a watch in years. I wanted to purchase something to go with my business casual dress that would not be too overpowering and still be nice. I had been eyeing this watch for awhile and finally decided to splurge.The watch seemed to be a bit too flashy for me when wearing blue jeans and t shirts, but that ok with me. The latch seemed to be a little bit tricky at first. Once I read the users manual and figured out how to use it I was ok.The reason for writing this article was for its durability. I took it on vacation but didn't want to wear it through security checkpoints. I decided I would stick it in a sock and just check the bag. Once I did this and got home I decided I would wash all of my laundry. Of course I forgot and left the watch in the sock. It goes through the washer and dryer, comes out still ticking. No scratches or anything. I'm impressed!"
1,Durable but Poor Longevity,"We purchased this about a year ago. It's connected to a Yamaha DGX 520 keyboard. The keyboard and pedal get moved about once every two weeks at most.The sustain pedal just stopped working. At first we thought it was the keyboard, but the keyboard checks out fine. Then I read more reviews on Guitar Center about the pedal and discovered it's a known issue.It still looks great and held up well, but what good is it if the components don't work.They need to work on this.So if you want one that will last more than a year look into something else."
2,Correction,"There is a small error in the description of the movie. The movie was made in former Czechoslovakia, so it would probably be best to call it a Czechoslovak movie. Moreover neither the director nor the actors are Czech, and the story takes place in Slovakia. This is a tragic story from the period of the first independent Slovak state and confiscation of Jewish property by Arians. Jozef Kroner (died 1998) was a leading Slovak actor. This is important to mention, because otherwise the historical setting is completely misplaced."
1,saw has small arbor,"This saw comes with a 5/8"" arbor to mount the blade. It is almost impossible to find replacement blades. Most 12"" mitre saws use a 1"" arbor to mount the blades. I sent the saw back without even using it due to the blade issue."
1,Vidal's invention,"This work was my introduction to Vidal and, frankly, I was not impressed. While somewhat well researched, much of it is Vidal's personal opinion and sounds oddly like a more hardcore Republican Party revisionist take on the Constitution and the founding fathers than one might imagine from someone allied with the Democrats. His arrogance on the subject makes it almost laughable. Vidal's writing style is choppy and disjointed in places. The whole work is entirely unsatisfying."
2,Great Aerator! Good Price! Sturdy!,I ordered this from Amazon since my local Home Depot didn't have it in stock. I followed other reviewers advise and pre-watered lawn but only for about 30 min. since there was some rain fall the day before. Very easy to use and sturdy. My husband and I had no problems aerating the lawn. This is a definite must have before you apply weed & feed.
2,A Page Turner,"I was excited to read the sequel to Sugar since I enjoyed that book thoroughly. This Bitter Earth kept my interest all the way to the end. However, I felt like there should have been a few more pages to tie up a loose end; the loose end being Mercy. A good read!"
2,I have read them all,Robert Crais has never written a bad book.HIS Crais') BEST is HOSTAGE but I have enjoyed Elvis Costello and his sometimes partner Joe Pike.I am anxously awaiting The Forgotten due soon
2,website issue,Just to resolve the website issue...when you access premierpress.com you get shunted to thompson course ware. If you go under graphic design titles the book is there with all the relevant images in a downloadable format...you don't even have to buy the book! Judging by the high quality of some of the images the book is probably pretty good (haven't read it) and you can get it now for a few bucks at auction websites as everyone had moved on to Pshop CS
1,A disappointing book,"This was not the best book about itas. It was not even a so-so book. It was badly written and the themes seemed randomly pasted together. I think the author tried to give an account of itas from the beginning of creation according to yoruba peoples until the present time. However, the book had too many digressions. It was also hard to read because simple things like spelling, punctuation, and complete words and sentences were often not correctly used. There was also a lot of misinformation about basic themes in itas. If the author wants to make up his own fiction that's ok. But he shouldn't pass this book off as something definitive on itas because it is not. After reading this, I don't think I would gamble on an Oba Ecun book again."
2,Great for junior high to college girls,"The book provides refreshing quips from a vast variety of successful ""women"" of all ages. The contemporary advice and anecdotes entertain throughout this easy-reading book. The stories are touching,heartwarming, and useful to everyday life and motivation."
1,LP [is bad]!,I don't know how this boy band got signed right out of High School. These guys are the Kriss Kross of the new Millenium. They have commercialized the last strong genre of rock. These [guys] are sellouts so if you still buy clearasil and eminem you'll love this piece of schlock.
1,"Vacuum, what vacuum?","I would never recommend this item to anyone. I won't return it to the vender because I don't think that is fair to them, so I will just take a loss.1. It does not pick up an ant or a spider, virtually nothing gets sucked up. You have to hold/trap the bugs for a long time and then maybe it will pick it up.2. It was a poor choice to create this with rechargeable batteries. It is a big charging stand that you will never want to look at in your house. It would be much better if someone made one that was battery operated.3. The creator seemed to think that people need to shock the bug and kill it. Well, I wouldn't care if it just sucked up the bugs and trapped them till they died. What do I care, bugs have no feelings, let them suffer. Adding that function is probably why it needs so much battery power.Save your money and don't make the mistake I made."
1,you really need some carbs...,"This is the unrevised version of Atkins, and it is still too heavy on protein to be a safe sustainable diet. Interesting to have on the bookshelf, but I found it unusable. Has lots of recipe cards and a fold out carb counter and a little book and suggestions for daily food plans based on certain carb levels.As a nurse, I say, unsustainable, way too high in fat and protein, seen plenty of people sick and on the verge of collapse from not eating as the book suggests and chowing down on steak and eggs and sausages and more eggs and wondering why they get dizzy and palpitations and they lose 5kg of water and go off the diet within two weeks and gain 6kg.Try the Zone. It may look complicated, but the key to modern day fat loss is insulin regulation (insulin is a fat storage hormone and it blocks fat releasing hormones), and high protein diets mess with your insulin levels as well as high sugar diets do."
1,Broadly-stated rules,"This is a book of platitudes. Short essays lightly describe the author's observations, and end (in most cases) with a bumper-sticker-esque proverb. Sometimes these text-bites are a summary of the essay, sometimes they're a logical stretch (the first chapter, for example).There are a few insightful truths here, though. There's a good section on sacrifice in the Relationships section. Customers sacrifice a great deal to do business with you. So you're obligated to return the sacrifice even more.A good, though unstated, assumption here is that every business would do better to think of itself as a service.Ironically, one of the best sentences in the book (in the Branding section) is a reasonable critique of this book: ""...like most rules, the dying-brand rule is stated too broadly, and thus misleads us."""
1,won't turn off!,"I had bought an earlier version of this model which worked perfectly for 10 years until the on button stopped working. I had been so pleased with that microwave that I bought this one without even checking the reviews. After 9 months the microwave stopped turning off after the timer bell rang. The cancel button doesn't work do I have to unplug it. I am trying to reach the nearest service center which is 20 minutes away, but they don't pick up their phone. Skip this one."
1,Discriminating gamer.,"This unit has been in my hands for two weeks, and already I'm having serious issues with it.First, either the controller can't send precise signals or the sensor isn't discrimination enough. Every so often, pressing one button will activate the function of a different button. (e.g. I'll press button 6 and button 2 will activate instead)Second, the right analog stick won't stay zeroed. I started out fine, but went south over time. It is now nearly unusable."
1,Dont bye Amazon products,"Never received the product, accoring to amazon it was delivered a week ago. It was actually delivered to Amazon not me! Not even a phone call. I will never buy another thing from them."
2,"Pirouline Rolled Wafers, sooo good.","Pirouline Rolled Wafers: Gave as presents and all that received raved about them, I knew they would as I really liked the taste, texture and simpleness of such a good treat."
1,Do not cancel noise.,"I bought these on a whim before a trip to Europe, hoping to get a little piece and quiet on the plane. All those people who paid $200 or more for the Bose noise canceling headphones always looked happy, so I figured I would attempt happiness on the cheap.Wow, did I waste my money. These headphones DO NOT cancel plane noise. Turning the noise canceling on made no discernable difference. To make matters worse, there is no way to disconnect the earbuds from the noise canceling unit, so I cannot use these while I work out -- unless I want to wear a neck strap while I'm jogging. Run, don't walk, away from these."
2,Its a good game,"Well 1st off I expected it to have more levels. In frontline it had 19 levels. In rising sun it only has 10 levels. Though they are levels are longer, rising sun is not worth $50. I would say more like $40. I would strongly recommend renting it 1st"
2,Fun and useful,"This book is excellent for anyone who has the Latte-Whip. I bought it just for making capucinnos, but it has recipes for everything from lemon butter to tomato sauce and even a few home-made cosmetics. I usually hate cooking, but this helps me make all kinds of new food in minutes.Some of the 'shakes' are a bit ambitious, not nearly as good as what a blender makes, but there's plenty of delicious and very original coffee, cocktail and mocktail recipes. Certainly worth the purchase."
2,Me and a Guy Named Elvis,"This is the book I've been waiting for! Jerry makes the reader a ""fly on the wall"" in the life of Elvis Presley. His compassion comes through in a very real, down-to-earth way which is refreshing. I appreciate his candor when he disloses stories about Elvis which were less appealing because this reflects a three dimensional person -- not concentrating just on the negative or on the positive. I appreciate his friendship with Elvis and it was profoundly apparent in his narrative that it was mutual. This is shown in many instances where Elvis continued inviting him to return to him full time.I love it! It was compelling and kept me reading well past my bedtime most nights. Bravo, Jerry!!Deni in Houston"
2,Beyond The Shackles,"Gripping, passionate, moving - a story of courage and hope when life presented none of the above."
2,"In one word, AMAZING!","I've tried different shapeware before, and nothing has ever worked. I got this on a recommendation and I'm now in love!I have a 30 inch waist, and ""tummy"" problems, when I put this on, my stomach was instantly flatter and I lost 2 inches on my waist! I couldn't believe it! I got the size Medium, so if you're about my size, Medium would be good for you! A large would have been to big. I'm tempted to try a Small though.I also can't believe how comfortable it is, it literally feels like you aren't wearing anything! I thought I wouldn't be able to breath, or bend over, but I can do both very easily! It doesn't ride up when I bend over either.And, as a bonus, I noticed it really felt like it was supporting my back. I have back problems, so I'm all for extra support for my back!I love this and will probably be buying more!"
2,What a magnificent way to teach children about loss!,"I work as a therapist, and I think this is a great book to help to ""normalize"" (as much as possible) the process of losing a pet. I think this book can also serve as a springboard for children and parents to talk openly about loss. Robie Harris' book is a hit!"
1,FREEZES! DO NOT BUY,"I bought this player because of the space and all of the features that you get with the price. However, right out of the box the mp3 player froze on the third song. It also freezes when ever I shuffel foward through the songs quickly. When it freezes I have to actually take out the battery and put it back in to restart the player. This is a huge hassle in the middle of a workout. Yes, this is one of the cheapest 1 gig mp3 players on the market.... but I unfortunatly found out that you get what you pay for. I am returning this to Amazon after one day of use and buying a better, more expensive player."
2,All of the Sissi movies,"I saw all Sissi's movies 40 years ago, I will like to have it in Inglish or Spanish on DVD. Is it possible or not?"
2,Good resource,"Bought this as a resource for our annual Haiti trips. While it's not a primary volume, it contains alot of good information that could be useful in many situations. Every rural family probably ought to have a copy."
1,History for the WWF generation,"I bought this book ... and I had few expectations of greatness; good thing, because this book is simply a rehash of old facts, put in a blender on frappe and extruded into a clumsy glop.... This is just about the worst book on the San Francisco earthquake and fire I have ever read. I can only recommend it as a starting point--go to any book cited in the bibliography for a more accurate, clearly written account. On the other hand, if you are only really interested in second-hand accounts of lost loved ones, vivid depictions of deaths, and hysterical accounts of rat migrations, this will serve admirably."
1,TERK TECHNOLOGY AF 9330 AM/FM ANTENNA TOWER,"I HAVE AN OLDER MODEL OF THIS SAME STYLE OF ANTENNA THAT HAS ALWAYS WORKED GREAT. I BOUGHT THE TERK TECHNOLOGY AF 9330 AM/FM ANTENNA TOWER THINKING IT WOULD WORK THE SAME, IT DOES NOT RECIEVE STATIONS VERY GOOD."
2,What You See Is What You Get,"If all your jobs can be done with the attachments in the advertisement you are good to go.Every item Shown in the AD works really well. I purchased the VAC. thinking i would buy some attachments for cleaning computers and blinds later,NOT going to happen. The hose end is flat and all brush attachments are round, so you are limited to jobs you are able to perform."
2,Superb title for Mars Images and Advanced Image Processing,This book explores the fundamentals of image processing as applied to satellite photography. The author also details the processing of the images of constructed features on the surface of the planet Mars. Mr. Carlotto was able to demonstrate in very easy terms the methods used to illuminate these breathtaking images. I eagerly await any book from this author on the latest set of images taken in 1998.
1,Really boring to read and confusing!,"The only reason i bought this and read it was for my English class. It is full of random short stories that are just really confusing and BORING to read. Sure, it may have meaning and all that, but it does NOT appeal to teens. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
2,Dark and Delightful,"O.K., so here's the plan. Start with Mieville's ""Un Lun Dun"". Then move on to Gaiman's ""Neverwhere"". Then advance to Simon R. Green's Nightside books, (say, ""Something From the Nightside"").That way you can have a lot of fun with how cleverly Mieville lays his alternate London right over the top of ""real"" London. Enjoy the zest and unruly imagination of a deeply original writer.Then compare with the almost stately, restrained elegance of Gaiman's approach to alternate-London. Gaiman's imagination is just boundless, and every page is infused with his great sense of place, and his deft touch. Sure the book is ""dark"", but only in a thrilling sense, not the world weary, or ironic, or hopeless style of many current writers.For a change-up go to the Nightside of London, with the noirish, tongue-in-cheek, and much more fantastical Green.Really, what a trifecta."
2,rayjoy@ipa.net,"I like many of the readers was a little dissapointed In the Title. I expected much more sniping stories,but I will not knock the book because of a misleading title. It was an outstanding book on the daily life of a grunt in Nam whether he be Army or Marine. Roadrunner6 Out"
2,Great Series!!,"I have all three seasons of ""Deadwood"" and love it. This is a very well written and acted series. I wish HBO would have finished the series. It was left hanging at the end of the third season. Still, well worth watching."
2,Magnifying the issue,"This magnifying lamp was a gift. It arrived in a decent interval of time after the order was placed. Unfortunately, the display box was placed inside a shipping carton without benefit of any material to cushion the product resulting in the fluorescent bulb being broken. A replacement was not so easy to find due to the specific color of the original bulb (which is one reason this model was choosen). Although the retailer would not refund the cost of the replacement bulb, they did refund the cost of the shipping and were prompt and communicative during the post purchase negotiations. I would purchase from this vendor again but probably not items that are breakable."
1,Lame Book - Waste of Money!!,"What a rip off. A 1st grader would be upset with this lazy, primer. Don't waste your cash. Anyone who has ever had a basic medical term, A&P; or hematology class could have written this. Did not learn anything to help with test. I bought it based on earlier good reviews. The author's relatives must have written them.Kathryn A. Kalanick ""Phlebotomy Technician Specialist: Certification Exam Review"" (also on Amazon) includes an excellent CD with study and test questions based on ASCP, AMT and NCA topics. The book is very good. Detailed review sections, with illustrations tests. Made a high score with this book. (I'm not related to anyone connected with this book!)Phlebotomy Technician Specialist: Certification Exam Review (Phlebotomy Technician Specialist Certification Exam Review)"
2,Good Info,"This book offered a lot of helpful information about detoxification through fasting. It gave me step by step, what to do to cleanse my body through fasting. However, I had read more than half of the book before I actually got any usable information. For such a small book, I thought it would be packed with info and how-to's on detoxification, but it constantly tells you to buy her other book ""How to Feel Great All The Time"". If you do lots of research on holistic health as I do, there is a lot of general information about eating healthy and such in this book, which I already know a lot about. If you know nothing about holistic health, this book will be an eye-opener."
1,A Victoria's Secret catalog would be more enticing...,"I read reviews from other people on the stuff they sell on Amazon, but wanted to give it a shot.I mean come on man! Gimme a break. Agree that the camera, clarity & quality of the DVD was good. But Peach needs to bitch-slapped back to where the belong, making freaking documentaries!! Totally uninteresting video of some women dancing. I fast fwd-ed the DVD and was done in less than 4 mins. That's it, I'm not watching this crap anymore...DO NOT BUY such DVD's on Amazon unless you believe is sadomasochism & want to punish yourself for spending money!"
1,Poor treatment of important topic,"Stephen Brookfield writes 254 pages on one of the most important topic in our world and basically says nothing useful. His style is very ""touchy / feely, and he writes very superfluous statements that provide little, if any enlightenment to the reader. On his primary topic on how to teach critical thinking I found no practical application. This book reminds me of a college student's attempt to write intelligently on an important topic, but it was way over his head."
1,"not just appalling, but boring too","Repetitive and trivializing are the words, unilluminating (and unhummable) the music -- together they reduce these 3 real people to cartoon characters as cardboard as any from an early Verdi opera! Hugely disappointing, especially coming from the Houston Opera. Avoid at all costs -- especially your own! Ugh."
1,Dave isn't Atlanis,"If you were a fan of Dave's work up until Everyday, you're not alone. Dave's ""sellout-tinnybopping-TLR"" album is his worst yet, Hardly having and resemblance to the Dave Matthews Band which used more instruments than Dave's electric guitar and the Glen Ballard lyrics that could have been made in a studio ""Anyday"". If you want a real Dave CD find a way to go the scraped Lillywhite Sessions... That's the 5 star album."
1,Worthless--DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"This product failed twice on me. My computer stopped recognizing it within a month of purchase. Verbatim sent me another. This one worked long enough to be out of warranty and then stopped being recognized by my computer or any computer. I tried various things to format it, etc. Nothing worked. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Fantastic,"If you love Hunter S. Thompson, this movie is a must!!! Great watch, especially if your fond of Fear & Loathing!! Hard to find except online!!!"
1,Not a definite favorite,"I don't like the fact that somebody can take a horror movie and turn it into a joke!I couldn't even get through this movie once.I just don't like films that express monsters as four-legged dog creatures.The Relic is a story about a ritual gone wrong when some foolish explorer actually drinks this weird concoction from a tribe of Indians.Mysteriously enough,the liquid turns him into a beastly creature that lives in the sewers under a mansion.Don't get this movie!"
1,not as great as the other reviewers stated,"This case is an okay choice as far as quality goes. I have a large Sephora train case that is higher quality than this one. It is worth paying an extra $30.00 for the Sephora case and get a case with better quality. I don't believe this case has a swivel handle as advertised, if it does than the one I got doesn't work. In addition, the trays in the top are plastic(not the greatest quality plastic either) with a flimsy metal type attachment that lifts the trays. The dividers, in the lower trays and compartments, are hard to adjust. There is a lot of room in the bottom compartment but it is hard to get to because of the way the trays are constructed. This is a gift for a person who does not have one at all so I think it will do, but if I was buying it for me I would return it. I did get delivery really fast, that's a plus."
1,roll top bread box,"For a bread box that was almost $50, I am very disappointed in how light it is in weight. To me, it is flimsy, and even with 2 loaves of bread in it, it slides around on the counter. It is very pretty, I will say that. But I expect more for my $50 and from Brabantia. I am sorry to return it, after spending hours doing research and reading reviews.....maybe there isn't a bread box out there that is the quality I expect."
2,VTM - Redemption - Superior to Bloodlines,"Played both, as far as ""adult"" games go; Redemption is far superior for it's storyline, characters, and - despite being earlier in graphics development - it has much more interesting settings. As an addict to VTM games, I was very happy to see Bloodlines released; nonetheless, turning it into a clone of every other ""war game"", adding a few vulgar terms, then severely limiting character development and disciplines did not work. The ""godlike"" werewolf was not interesting for any vampire fan, and humans - even ghouls - running backwards in the dark, faster than any vampire can move, while firing weapons (And hitting the target) gets too silly. Flaws in middle english grammar, and the concept of ""average"" medieval europeans being able to read or write is not as silly as much that is in Bloodlines. As an adult game, both are too censored, but Bloodlines has no excuse."

2,Awesome Hair Dryer,"I have been using the hair dryer for almost a month. It works great and has nice features like the cool air blast and the night light. To me, it is a lot quieter than my old dryer, and mounting it on the wall only took a few minutes. The night light is perfect for the size of bathroom it is in. If the motor lasts longer than 3 mos. (which is all my Jerdon dryer lasted,) this is an excellent product!!!!"
1,Not as advertised,"This product is advertised to have a ""crystal clear"" view.Not even close.Also, the software packaged with it, is not supported by ATI.For technical support, be sure to dial the new 800 number.When I bought it, they only had a toll number so I used my cell phone. I received a charge on my next bill for a 75 minute call to Canada for $45.00.Beware of this product and any other TV tuner ATI offers. The concept makes sense, but they have not perfected it yet.It would have been cheaper for me to get a color TV with a built in DVD player.Paul"
1,Pulled my hair out,"Even when new, the DVD player would freeze and stutter step on some prerecorded DVDs. It was my first DVD player, so I wrote it off as scratched/marred discs (we rent most of ours). Then as the warranty expired, it would spaz on virtually every disc. The kids would be hysterical as Dash froze in his unIncredible escape. When ejected, the disc was a hot pancake! I then bought another CHEAP DVD player which has worked great on all DVDs for a year.MORAL OF THE TALE. Steer clear of this model - YUCK"
1,"Not good for ""standing up"" while they go!","This box didn't work well for my cat who, strangely enough, likes to remaining fairly upright while he pees. The problem is that there is no interior wall - the little entrance stair leads into the box but the cat doesn't really have to step around a corner. Hence, my big boy proceeded to go right over the staircase edge (while in the box), and the urine drained right down the stairs. Very luckily for me, there was sort of a catchment-effect at the bottom and most of the urine remained pooled up on the last stair, but it was a very close call and some did leak over.If your cat reliably squats way down this may well be good, but know how your cat goes before you buy!"
2,If you love Clay aiken you will Love this CD,Out of all the songs on this album there were only twosongs that Ididn't thing were appropriate for his voice. some of the songs he got to do what he does best and that was to hit the high notes. Very well done was happy to see it at amazon and bought it immediately. Hopefully his next album will be just as good.
1,Good service,"The seller was great in this transaction, but the book itself lacked in the content.If you really want to find out some of the ""meat and potatoes"" about freemasonry, get your hands on a copy of ""The Morals and Dogma of the Scottish Rite""; it will let you know about a lot of the garbage that goes on within the PHILOSPHY of the cult."
1,Not for Spike the Dinosaur,"I typed in ""Spike the Dinosaur Battery Charger"" on Amazon's search, and this charger popped up. It is not the charger that fits the battery that Spike came with...unfortunately I did not find this out until it came to the house. The company that sells it doesn't refund shipping. The charger was $6 and the shipping was $6.09. Amazon customer service answer: Mail back to the company, get my 6 bucks back, then call customer service again to get a Amazon credit for the $6.09. So I would be out the cost to mail back to the company, cost of gas to go to post office, and the time to wait in line to mail it back. Product will end up in a land-fill.Not very happy about this, but at least it is only 12 bucks. Venting here has made me feel better about it."
1,"Man approaches 50, frets interminably about it, who cares?","Keep turning the pages, you think, it might get better, there might somewhere be one original scene, thought or character, some insight about that big number that eventually looms up for all of us who live long enough. But forget it, not this time, not here, as divorced Doug frets endlessly -- about his ex-wife remarrying, about his children, about his sports writing job under the new management of the sports daily where he works, about his sex life, about his incompatibility with anyone else's musical tastes, about his aging parents. Ho hum, I'm 50 and I need my sleep. This one won't keep me from it."
1,"OK, you're right. So What?","The Florida vote count was certified with Mr. Bush winning by a paper thin margin. Mr. Gore's supporters immediately began a campaign to discredit the ballots, the Florida Secretary of State, and the intelligence of the Florida voters in selected counties. The first judicial outrage was perpetrated by the Florida Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court only became involved when it was obvious that the Florida court was determined to hand the election to Mr. Gore. Yes, the U.S. Court had no business ruling on a state issue but neither did the Forida court. Given the close tally, there should have been a statewide recount, including absentee ballots. As it turns out, Gore would have lost the very re-count scenarios his cry-baby supporters were demanding. I sincerely hope Mr. Gore is the Democratic nominee in 2004, 2008 and 2012."
1,Condition was not good.,Book came on time but the condition of the book was not good. The cover was almost separate from the book. I had to glue the whole book. Not very happy :(
2,great bag so far,"I received this bag in August and have used it everyday for daycare since October. (It is now April) Thought it was about time I wrote some reviews for the items I received and was surprised at all the bad reviews this bag has had. All I can say is that I love it: it fits tons of stuff, very easy access to all pockets, nice little extras. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of five is indeed the front pocket could be a little bigger (for the bottles), but that is it."
2,free spirit and incisive intellect,"I loved this book. If a man had written it, everyone would be praising it....it's very funny, and very sad, and the voice is quite unique. Ahead of its time."
2,"Best love story I've read, possibly ever","This is a wonderful love story, one filled with passion, romance and just the right ammount of conflict.Once you start reading this you will be drawn in and not want to put down the book until you've finished.I encourage you to read the next three books in this series, but Twilight is strong enough to be read as a stand alone novel if you don't want to get in too far. Be forewarned - once you get past chapter one in New Moon you won't be able to stop."
2,Essential Idioms in English,"It has been rated with 5 stars for the following reasons:It is very easy to get familiarized with the idioms. The step-by-step approach is very convenient and it facilitates the learning process.With respect to the previous edition more friendly and pleasant to read.A very well edited book.Although the content remains substantially the same, we find outstanding improvements."
2,Well worth it...,The beginning was a little slow but soon it starts to come together. This was a movie I brought my wife to so she could watch a movie without all the action I usually subject her to. I ended up loving this movie and would see it again.
2,Dorrie and the witches imp,"the book was in good condition, but there were a few things that were not told when i bought it. it was a library book and had page ripped in the front. i was aware it was not a collectors book so it was not in perfect condition but i would have liked to know those thing before purchace. overall, i am happy to have found it."
1,Comfortable But Falling Apart,"The first pair of these slippers I received as a gift and they lasted for a year of daily wearing. They were very comfortable and good for light outdoor use. The second pair I bought off Amazon and I have worn them for less than a month. The thread has unraveled, separating the sole from the slipper on both slippers. I do like the style and comfort of the slipper but am really disappointed in the quality."
2,"Words To Live By, Quote, And Laugh about","""Quotable Saints"" is a book containing a collections of sayings from many Saints, Blesseds, and Venerables, both famous and obscure. Organized into 30 topics, they provide the reader with entertaining reading, leavened by quotes which are insightful, edifying, and, in some cases, humorous. Some quotes will help you see life differently, others will spice your speech and writing, and some will just make you laugh. I enjoyed reading ""Quotable Saints"" and am confident that you will also."
2,This product works wonders.,Cosamin DS was recommended to me by a friend. I had knee problems and it hurt me to walk up steps. I couldn't believe after taking this product for a week my knee pain went away and I can walk up steps with out pain. I have recommended Cosamin DS to several people since. Wonderful product.
1,Good Concept - Too Bad They Leak,"This is a nice, sturdy glass bottle, with a spring clasp and a wire hanger. The problem is, the tube has a ball bearing type stopper that leaks when you invert the bottle into the cage drinking position. Apparently, there is a manufacturing defect. Perhaps the tube is at the wrong angle to allow the stopper to prevent leaking. When in the fully upright position, the entire contents will eventually leak out, a drop at a time. That is not acceptable. I bought two and both had the same problem, so I returned them. It is a very nice design; it is a shame this problem exists."
2,Chuck: The Complete Second Season,"I love Chuck, if you're looking for a great, new, funny show, then check out Chuck. It gets better and better with every season."
2,This was a gift,"My toddler and 4 year old both love this story! It is simple and fun. Of course, like all Boynton books it rhymes!"
1,Disjointed collection of documents and PK photographs,"Considering the author was an officer and probably one of the better soldiers in the SSTK division this book is a huge disapointment. Ullrich's book consists of nothing more than a collection of maps, documents, and Propaganda Kompanie photographs that do little to explain history of probably one of the most remarkable and controversial divisions of the Waffen-SS. Karl Ullrich was with the division during its most critical engagements but provides the reader with no useful information or insite into the fighting qualities, organization or personalities of the 3 SS Panzer Division.I would recommend this book if you are only interested in pictures of SS men and SS equipment. As a historical document it leaves much to be desired."
1,"Algebra, an Incremental Approach",I think this book is really is bad. It makes Algebra even more complicated then it really is. The font is not that exhilarating. The reading level is for adults. The book itself is very long. If you just started Algebra this book is not for you. And anyway it mixes Algebra 1 and 2. My recommendation is don't read. If there were a choice of giving this book 0 stars I would have picked.
2,Perfect,I upgraded the memory on an old Compaq from 2-256M sticks to 2-1G sticks. I've had no problems with the memory. PNY has always been a dependable brand for me.
1,The Rule of BORE,"This novel made me carsick, with all its needless jerking and twisting, poorly timed leaps and ""surprises."" And worst of all, at the end of this long grueling ride, you find you haven't arrived anywhere worthwhile after all. Uggh. If you're into sophomoric college social scenes, puerile musings, two-dimensional characters, shameless name-dropping, and vapid plots-- or if you want to know if that one guy REALLY DID GO TO PRINCETON-- read this book. Otherwise, you'd probably have more fun pulling out your teeth with rusty pliers.The only thing worse than reading The Rule of Four was having to see the two self-important bombastic pseudointellectual ""authors"" on the dust jacket. ""Hey, did we mention we're Ivy Leaguers?!"""
1,jane austen meets david lynch...,"from what i've seen so far, about 20 minutes....think jane austen meets david lynch, or something equally as strange....not a fan."
2,Want a fun mystery? Start with book one!,"In my opinion, the ""Hannah Swensen Mysteries"" should definately be read in order! To me, the whole series is like one big book of friends. If you pick up this book, which is the sixth in the series, and read it before you have read the previous stories, you probably will be disappointed. Every book I read, I love Hannah, Lisa, Norman, and Moshe more! Is Hannah perfect? No! But, who is? So, if you are interested, start with book one.Yes, this book is different from the first five. But, I liked that it had a different flare. This is not my favorite in the series but I wouldn't have missed it! Don't compare this series to others! This is the type of mystery where you lean back, kick off your shoes, grab a bon bon, and enjoy a fun and entertaining story. I love the development of the characters, the funny situations, the mysteries, and the conclusions. These are definately not boring or tedious. They are light and fun."
1,Cheap Plastic Wheel,This is very cheaply built plastic reel which is very weak and not worth the price and the product quality is poor at best.
2,Cheese Board Marble,"This cheese board is great. It is not real heavy and doesn""t take up much room. Fits nicely on a small table or a small island leaving room for other things."
2,Grey's Anatomy - Season Two,"You've got to absolutely love the wonderul humor on this program, and be absolutely moved by the drama. This show is so well written and acted, that I can not believe my luck! There's not much on t.v. anymore that's really worth 30 to 60 minutes of your time, but Grey's Anatomy, by far, IS. I don't really laugh much anymore, and I don't really cry much anymore, but guaranteed I'll be doing one or both on every single episode! And I just love the cliffhangers they leave us, I am such a huge fan. I hope this program will stand the test of time and continue to ""WOW"" us again and again. And oh what I wouldn't give to spend just one hour with ""Dr. McDreamy""... hee-hee! :) Cheers!"
2,Invaluable - but flawed,"A history of Trinidad and Tobago by its ""father"" is clearly invaluable as a primary document, and also as a lead to other primary documents he quotes. Readers should be aware, though, of the context in which it was written - hastily, without thorough editing, and obviously from a position of relative bias given his role in Trinidad's independence movement. Nonetheless, essential reading for anyone interested in learning about or researching Trinidad & Tobago."
2,Quality Framing nailer.,"Ive forgotten what I paid for my Nailer around $200. It works well.the depth adjuster sometimes finds its way moved. It takes 21deg plastic collated nails which might be more expensive than the paper.. I with all my air tools use air tool oil a few drops with each load of new nails in air inlet, I also spraymy loaded nails with silicon spray, I very rarely have a jam. I had all kinds ofJams with my Bostich roofing nailer before spraying the nails with silicon.all in all its a nice nailer no regrets.."
2,A powerful woman's jewel,"You wouldn't guess at the power of this book from it's size. As finely written as the complicated, intricately tatted lace fancywork Laverne's mother tatted into bleached sugar sacks, ""still whole after fifty years."" Stories as gripping and gritty as anything Hemingway ever wrote, featuring hailstorms that break every window in the house, treacherous horses, dogs, and rattlesnakes, and scandalous cowboys. Frequent flashes of wise, deep humor, understated and droll, that catches you unawares and leaves you laughing out loud. This was a woman worthy of the name. Would make a terrific movie."
1,DISPLEASED WITH PRODUCT,"THE INSTRUCTIONS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPLIED BY PALM TO ENABLE ME TO TRANSFER MY DATA FROM A PALM IIIc TO THE CURRENT PRODUCT LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED. I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS AS PER THE INTERNET AND COULD NOT ACHIEVE THE TRANSFER OF DATA. IN ADDITION, THERE IS NO TELEPHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO GET HELP. AS FAR AS I AM CONSERNED, THE PRODUCT IS A DUD AND NOT WORTH ANY ADDITIONAL TIME ON MY PART TRYING TO GET IT TO ACHIEVE WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR. AS OF RIGHT NOW IT IS OF NO USE TO ME."
2,Good...,"I think this was good... that is mostly all I can say because I really enjoyed the wheel of time series and if I had not been caught up in the story from all the book that proceeded this one I would not have enjoyed this as much... still, it is very interesting conclusion to the wheel of time (for now) and the last few chapters were worth crawling through the rest of it."
2,review...,"i picked up this cd on a whim. i was in the soundtrack section, eliza dushku was on the cover, what can i say?? turns out it is really good! its loud rock/soft metal-type music. i usually like music like phish and ani difranco but as i was listening to the soul survivors soundtrack on the way home from the bookstore, i got so into it! i was 'dancing' in the car and attempting to sing along. i definetely recommend this cd to rock fans, even non-rock fans. it was definetely a good buy."
2,Crunchy Treat,"I give these to my shar-pei instead of rawhide and he enjoys them a lot. They are dehydrated cow tails, so there are little crunchy bones inside of them. If your dog tends to gobble up things quickly or if you have a smaller type dog, I would probably opt for something else. I have had no problems giving them to my dogs (I also have a Doberman) who chew them slowly though. I like these because they do not contain four, corn, or other junk typical dog treats have."
2,great books for the people who think math is fun,"Not a professional mathematician, I feel this book is challenging enough to be interesting, but not beyond what I can follow. The book is beautifully printed and bound, making it even more enjoyable to read."
1,Don't Buy This - Not worth the headaches!,"Perhaps because FoxNews owns a piece of Susteen Corp., well, DataPilot, when used to put new address entries into your cell phone, does something very sneaky. It embeds a RESET for each address and tells phone the ringer is the FoxNews ringer! If your phone has internet and no foxnews ringer, each person calling that is in your addr book causes the phone to search fox web site for a ringer. Cust Serv and Tech Supp UNRESPONSIVE after 60 days of trying! You get stuck having to edit EVERY addr entry on phone, resetting ringer to normal and deleting foxnews logo as default image for EVERY entry! ALSO, contrary to their ads, be VERY careful... MOST new phones do NOT allow you to connect to internet via datapilot on laptop. Sprint, Cingular and others now blocking this but DataPilot keeps advertising this capability."
2,Ellen unplugged and at her best.,Ellen does a fanastic job making and writing her own stories jokes and words in this book. She encourages you not to always take things so seriously and gives you a major laugh. WARNING: Only read while on firm surface- you might fall off of it laughing.
2,nutritious & filling for my child,"My child has been a lover of Chicken Pot Pie soup since she was 2 years old. She's probably had 3 cans per week over the last 4 years. A full can is just the right serving size for her and it has a nice variety of vegetables. Unfortunately she's not fond of chicken in general, so I give it to her minus the chicken. I'm disappointed that I can't find it in local stores anymore."
1,Money down the drain,"NOT happy with this one - my three year old son and I tried to make the imprint of his hands in the gel mold this evening and it was nothing but a HUGE mess. Instructions tell you to immediately put their hands/feet in the gel mold so it can form around their hand. Sounded simple enough except for the fact that we sat there waiting and waiting with NO drying. I can't blame my son, he got impatient with it and started sliding his hand and crinkling his fingers and all we had left was a slimy hand and a few dried pieces of gel in the mold. I think that if we had waited for the gel to dry more it would have been better but you only have one chance to get it right and if you follow the directions it will be botched.One Mothers Day present down the drain. Sadly - it was the only one, I am VERY disappointed in this product."
2,Wild and Whirry,"Kinky and splendid low-budget nonsense. I got this out of the library with no expectations and was very pleasantly surprised. Shannon Whirry is no Meryl Streep when it comes to acting, but she has a certain heroically unpretentious style... Watching her coolly and woodenly dispatching bad guys is just about the most fun you can have on a Friday night after the pubs have shut! Just don't approach this movie expecting to be challenged. Lots of nudity, sneering grade-Z acting, cheesy synth soundtrack and an utterly ridiclous script: Dangerous Prey is the business."
1,muddy reading,"The notation can be hard to follow if you don't have a grasp or natural incline for statistical regression. Steps are hard to come by in some problems because too many steps are skipped for a beginner. It is almost necessary to have at least a basic statistics background before reading this.Even though I had a background and had read ahead, I had to depend on my professor to truly understand the material at all. If your professor has an accent or goes quite fast, and if you don't have classmates you can work with, using this book alone will be more than painful.I would suggest a supplement such as ""Using Econometrics: A Practical Guide (4th Edition should suffice) [Hardcover] by Studenmund"" if you are just beginning to learn about regression."
2,Power of roots reggae,"Im new to Alpha Blondy. I don't understand the language, but the music is serious roots. This is a great reggae cd, if you are looking some roots. I love the RAI or the middle eastern, African sound. Those last three tracks could really rock a party."
1,More thought should have gone into this one,"This is a fun idea, but once the baby starts to crawl after the monkey and touches it, the monkey falls over and is unable to get back up. You would have thought the manufacturers would have tested this on toddlers before hand!"
1,the format was wrong from what was advertised. very disappointed,I was very disappointed as the format was 4:3 instead being in its original widescreen format. The Amazon description was doe widescreen and I reported the error a few times.
2,Just like they said...,"For the money, this is a great buy!Pros: The description doesn't list all the accessories like: 2 sets of headphones w/2 headphone jacks in the side, remote, mounting bag, cables to connect to tv, cassette adapter, lighter and power plug. The outside of the player seems rubbery like it could take a fall off a table and not break instantly. Nice picture, easy to use and it played our DVD+R's & CD's.Cons: The battery only lasts around 3 hours. That is not enough for our 5 hour flight to California but I bought 2 and switched to the other. Luckily my kids would share. Also, I found the same model in a mall in California for $79...I almost bought another one! Another small dissapointment is that you can't hook them together to show one movie on two screens.Very happy with the first 2 weeks!"
2,fantastic high quality toy,I purchased the Melissa and Doug folding stable for my daughter on her 8th birthday although I had reservations because the age range for it says 3-8. I was concerned she would grow out of it too fast even though she had insisted she wanted a stable for her set of horses. I needn't have worried; she absolutely adores it and plays with it a lot. Even if she loses interest in a year or two it is such high quality workmanship and such beautiful wood that I consider it a collector's item and to be kept for future generations. For anyone with a horse lover in the family this is the stable to get. Even the fencing that comes with it is exquisitely made!
2,Thumpin cans,"These are the best headphones I have ever owned. I don't buy $250 types but these are great. They are of good quality,portable and sound fantastic!"
1,STARFORCE PROTECTION,"This game is really outdated. Outdated graphics, Outdated cars and Outdated physics, Besides the fact that it has Starforce Protection... After trying this game and having to wipe my HDD to get rid of the Starforce crap, I will never buy one again that uses that protection and NO I'm not trying to steal games or make bunches of copies, my game was brand new and Starforce messed up Windows XP so bad I had to wipe my drive and start all over again from scratch!.Other than the Starforce junk, I found the game to be mediocre at best with very poor graphics, compared to modern games. It does not work well with anything other than a steering wheel (for realism I mean) and I won't go that expense for just a game. All in all, I'm really dissapointed in this game... So much for the good reviews..."
2,Again I have the movie/book/and tape series...use them in class,"The first time I read this I knew this was perfect for teacher, coaches, counselors the whole smear...never a better book written except maybe the bible/or Vince Lombardi's Run To Daylight."
1,Poor Authoring,"I have to say I bought the first one and found it really funny, the titles got a bit annoying, but I found the dvd itself very well put together and slick. Unfortunately the same can't be said for this one, I found it very poorly put together, black gaps between everything and have had 2 copies and still find they stick at the same points on a number of dvd players. Shame they didn't stick to the original format as the episodes are very funny, but it spoils the enjoyment of watching them."
2,Very eye-opening and interesting documentary! Highly recommended!,"This documentary was done quite tastefully and informatively. Taking a look at how life is on the other side of the world, where there are no Starbuck's at each corner, and you have to make and find your food, can definitely be refreshing and eye-opening from the every day American life.This documentary demonstrates how hard life can be and how much that we should appreciate the opportunities and lifestyles afforded to us in the U.S.Great documentary to show friends, families, classes, and anyone interested on a new take of life and/or Indian culture.Great job Jeanne Yu!"
1,This is okayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,The songs wre okay but the song that I did not like the most was Ride the lighting. It didnot even sound close to the origanal.
1,A Load of B.S.,"This book is completely untrue, unreliable, and, above all, unbiblical.For one, Jesus Christ did begin to perform miracles until he was thirty years of age (when he began his ministry). Even then, he only healed to show others that he was the Christ. He did not spend his childhood healing little birdies with broken wings. That is an absurdity.And two, Jesus did not know Judas as a child. If he did, he was definitely not possessed by SATAN! Preposterous! Judas was possessed by Satan only for a brief time; when he partook of the Last Supper sacreligiously. John 13:27 of the New Testament states clearly, ""As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.""This book is a load. To take this book of lies as truth would be stupid."
1,Made my pups sick,"I followed the directions, giving them 1/2 dose to start. I sprinkled it over their food and within 10 minutes they both threw-up.Don't waste your money. My one pup NEVER throws up."
2,The truth about professional dancing,"I used to do Ballet and Tap for almost ten years, while my expirence wasn't nearly as demanding or professional as portrayed in this film, it had the same ""rules."" Ballet truely is the hardest sport to learn, its demands on the body are inhumane, but the end result is beautiful. This movie gave outsiders a rare glimpse into the lives of professional dancers. It is so important to have the perfect body and do the steps perfectly that it can be too hard. A lot of the acting felt fake and forced, mainly the ones who were actually professional dancers. This film is great and gives people the real meaning of discpline."
2,Essential,Read this years ago during my career as a print journalist. Reading this may result in you never believing any news story involving stats or science. That was its effect on me.
1,complete garbage - don't get burned!,"Yes, this product deserves zero stars. It's too bad that's not offered as an option.Toshiba has perfected the art of engineering a product that will only last a few weeks beyond the expiration of its warranty. How that saves them money I don't know, but I assume they've found the cheapest parts available.This thing will read absolutely nothing that's put into it, and I bought it brand new about a hundred days ago. Its warranty is good for 90 days.Needless to say, I will NEVER buy a Toshiba product again. All I got out of this experience is that knowledge and the chance to pass it on to others. Learn from my lesson!"
2,amazing,i love the turbo blow dryer its the best the price is totally woth buying :-D it works wonders :-)
1,Warning: Defective CD!,"Please be aware that this is a defective cd. It is a new type of cd that Universal Music Group is releasing that they claim is ""copy-proof."" The truth of the matter is, which they proudly admit to, it will not play in ANY computer cd-rom, dvd player, or even some cd players. If you're like me, and use your dvd player as your cd player at home, it simply won't work."
1,"Wood's novels get dopier and dopier-shallow,shallow.shallow","I have read every one of Wood's books, starting with his first, ""Chiefs"" which was good. But he has gone downhill ever since. I now read them only to satisfy myself that he is getting worse with each outing. His characters are cardboard and his dialogue and plots are pathetic. What happened to this novelist? The loose ends in his plots are never picked up, and in one page he covers territory and decisions that other writers would spend chapters developing, with some depth. His favorite lines seem to be ""good idea"" or ""I agree"", so that further development of the theme becomes unnecessary. In his latest book, for example, in one page, his heroine goes from being a major in the service to agreeing to become a police chief without asking one question about her new job from a person she met just a minute ago--PURE WOODS!!!"
2,"Hilarious ""Mom-tries-to-get-peace-from-kids"" tale","Has a plot that EVERY mother will know all too well. Mrs. Elephant futilely tries to relax in the bath; this is impossible with her three active kids. Illustrations are colorful and funny, so is the story. Great gift for ages 3-5 years; older siblings will enjoy listening to it as well."
1,misleading description of the product,"I had no idea that I needed a desk with this. I had the MyFirstLeapPad but it wasn't sufficient. Nowhere in the description did it state I needed the desk for this. I am disappointed. Hopefully by the time you are reading this, the description of the item has become more descriptive adding this."
2,Unique Christmas music,"My son-in-law is a not a big fan of Christmas music, however he does love Jethro Tull as do I. We ordered this for him and he really really likes it. It is very good, with a good mix of music."
2,Good read,"Suspenseful, enjoyable read. Not what I would consider to be typical Ken Follett, but a look back at America when..."
2,Garmin nuvi 670 review,"I've had a Garmin Quest for many years and have used it throughout the U.S. and Europe on many trips. I bought the Nuvi 670 for my other cars. It has improved antenna sensitivity to work better in a city environment, pre-loaded U.S. and European maps, clearer and enhanced voice instructions as well as blue tooth and other features make this a really enjoyable and useful product."
1,Don't wast your money on this item.,"I bought two of them for Christmas gifts and they both did not work. The box said not to return to the store, but to call their 800#, which you can't get through to speak to a representative. Seems I may be stuck with 2 of these defective units. Save your money."
1,Not a Clancy alternative,"I am constantly on the hunt for a writer that will fill in the gap left behind when clancy decided to write jaw-dislodgingly boring books, and Poyer's not it. I am halfway through China sea now and I have to force myself to keep going. Other reviewers have complimented him for his ""poetic"" writing, and compared to some of the semi-illiterates seen in this genre, they have a point. But this heroic effort to use beautiful imagery is constantly punctured, as when the main character, Dan Lenson, is at the railing at the end of the day. The sun hanged ""like a blood-filled condom"" over the sea.......Dostojevsky he's not.Anyway, to sum it up, it's mildly boring but there's worse to be had.C."
1,lasts maybe 3 days,"At first i was excited to have my own shock pen. I tricked my friends pretty good,but the batteries died after 3 days of use, and eventually the pen just fell apart."
2,The Stair Case,"I found this eight-part series intriguing. As the story unfolds, mainly through the eyes of the accused, author Michael Peterson and his defense team, the more fascinating it becomes. Did his wife fall down the stairs or did he kill her? As more and more information is uncovered, fact really does seem stranger than fiction. I couldn't wait for each episode on TV."
2,I'll tell you what you want what you really really want..,"To see pictures of Geri topless or with very little clothing on.. At least that is why my ex bought this video! This video is about Geri and her ""glamour/fashion"" modeling before her career as a Spice Girl. There are interviews on the video with people Geri previously worked with and many positive things are said about her. The cover makes it look like a really trashy video, but it isn't that bad. I would have enjoyed it more if the cover hadn't made the video out to look so distasteful, but that is what sells.I recently gave the tape to a friend of mine who loves the Spice Girls but her boyfriend cannot stand them! This video they actually watched together! ;)If you are a *gigantic* Spice Girls - Ginger fan, you will want this for your collection, however it is *NOT* for young viewers with the semi-nude content. No other Spice Girls are featured in this video."
2,once a mouse,I thought that this was a good book beacause it really is good for little kids. It is a easy book to read with very detailed pictures describing what is happening. If you are looking for a good book to read to a little kid this would be a good one. I would reccomend this book to people of all ages.
1,It is confusing,"Some of the guys said ""It worked perfectly"" and the others said ""Did not work"". I bought the product; it did not work at all. No audio output. I tried all the scenarios; change the cables, unplug one source, activate the two sources together,... you name it and still no audio. For the guys who got the product working, it would be nice to till us how. Otherwise, I would assume that the product is defected and the manufacturer should come back with a solution."
1,Don't buy this,We ordered this for my son's birthday. Two boxes arrived separately from different shipping companies. There were hundreds of pieces including the nuts and bolts and there were no instructions.
1,Keep looking for a gluten-free granola.,"I paid $5 or $6 for a single bag at the store and am less than pleased with this product. I find it incredibly crunchy in an almost painful way, but it's not stale. The taste is also slightly bitter and, just like another commenter mentioned, there is hardly a trace of berry anything to be seen in this bag. I would really find a different granola if I were you and save the money for something you won't regret."
1,"Great looking, until they corrode!","I fell for all the hype on the package from the Intermatic/Malibu company. They advertise such a fine product, being manufactured out of ""metal"" (as opposed to ""cheap"" plastic) and offer you a great warranty, but when you read the small print, they don't warrant the finish. Mine came out of the box looking beautiful. Installed them this spring (March), it's now July, they are all corroded. The finish is terrible. It's understandable that there will be water spots from sprinklers, but the metal is actually corroding and the clear coat finish is flaking off. After spending a lot of money on each of these lights, I would have expected much better.Don't buy anything made my Malibu. Go for any other brands made out of aluminum, be it painted or finished. The Malibu brand was very disappointing. I would have given these ""zero"" stars, but the option isn't available."
1,not what was expected,"The item look nothing like the item received, will not shop with this company again."
2,TV-Be-Gone,Supplier shipped product promptly. Product works as advertised. There have been many obnoxious TVs that have turned off.
1,EGR brand is much better quality,"[ 4-piece set for 2005 Ford Freestyle]I've bought many sets of AVS visors over the years. Their quality has definitely gone down hill! The tint color is unattractive. The edges were not finished well. The surface had scuff-marks. And it took three sets to get one that didn't have a cracked visor, right out of the box!Fortunately, Lund International's customer Service is Superb! I guess they NEED to be.I ordered a set of EGR visors for my Nissan Titan at the same time. They were beautiful. At least twice the thickness as the AVS (where needed), no scuff-marks, smooth edges, installed in a couple minutes. Cost about $6 more! Nuff said!"
1,Can't change fuse !!!,"Product worked for 1 Jump Start. In owners manual (if you want to call it that), it states main fuse may need to be replaced. It says to change fuse in front of product. Can't find where this is for the life of me. Can't find help. The product is from China. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY ."
2,A Wonderful Reference,"I often use patterns from Burda World of Fashion Magazine. These patterns are famous for their sparse, inadequate sewing directions. I love using the patterns so I bought this book to augment the Burda World of Fashion directions. Now, almost everything I need to know is in one place. The book covers almost every technique imaginable and the photographs are a tremendous help. I was afraid the book would be too simple, but it not the case. I think it's a good resource for beginners and intermediate sewists."
1,Definitely not recommended,"I had paid the premium price after seeing ""Remastered Edition."" But the image quality was inferior, the sound blurry, the movement jerky. I'm surprised that Amazon carries this version. The movie ""Royal Wedding"" itself, of course, is a typical grand Astaire vehicle, containing, amongst other routines, his classic dances with a coatrack and dancing on the ceiling. I don't know which DVD version to recommend, however."
2,Buffet Hawaiin Style,"I love Buffet music and having this instrumental Hawaiin style is really great,it will work well for the wedding laua i am having next month."
1,silver anniversary to the manor born,"I have the complete set of ""to the manor born"" and love it, the personalities of Audrey and Richard are so strong yet they fall for each other - ending was great.I was very disappointed in the silver edition - Audrey seems to have lost her strong personality and let Richard take over for the past 25 yrs (implied in show)I was expecting a much better show, one that really tied into the series - this did not do that. It is all based one event - was hoping it would be more like the original seriesI did not find it worth the moneymvb"
1,A first- and last-time DeMille reader,"Somehow this book ended up on my bookshelf, and as I was desperate for something to read on a trip, I gave it a go. The story itself was fairly interesting and well-done; in fact, it kept me reading (barely) despite my extreme dislike of the main character, John Corey. Corey's arrogance, chauvinism, and often inappropriate wisecracking was quite tiresome and even offensive on several occasions. The character himself admits to all these faults, but that does not make them any easier to bear nor does it excuse them. I also disliked much of Corey's behavior, and I was appalled by his treatment of the villain in the climax. Violence and other destructive acts certainly have their place in novels as integral elements of a story or character, but in this case I did not find Corey's behavior at all motivated or justified. Frankly, I find it disturbing that a character like this is seen as a ""hero""."
1,Bad Product,"Received this product and the none of the 3 cd units would function. Returned it and received a replacement unit. Set up and turned on the unit and again none of the 3 cd units would funcction. A piece of junk, obvious design or manufacturing flaws. WORTHLESS !!!!!"
1,Trite,"I had heard great things about Ram Charan, so perhaps my expectations were set a bit high. I realy got very little out of this, indeed, I didn't finish it. This review is of the audio edition. I have a bias against professional readers who don't understand what they are reading. While the reading was very professional, it tended to put one to sleep, because the reader didn't know where the important infections were. Other details like pronouncing DEC (Digital Equipment) as ""Dee Eee Cee"" added to the impression."
1,Gel Max Schock Doctor,"I could not gets the Gel Max shock doctor to fit even after I boiled it six different times. Every time I tried to get a new fit it wouldn't stay in. If you want a mouthguard that fits don't buy the Shock Doctor Gel Max, it's not woth the $10."
1,What happened to the light?,"This book got such rave reviews and it was a compelling read up until the end. All this talk about how the author survived and ""stepped into the light"". I kept reading because I thought it was going somewhere but in the end, recovery aside, he still rationalizes and justifies destroying his own immediate family in order to live ""an authentic life."" Brave confessional -- sure, but he also used the book to get even with people who'd hurt him and I don't like when authors do that. He is a good writer but that doesn't mean he's got character, aside from the recovery. He knows this is true but not to the extent that it is true. His recovery does seem miraculous."
1,Not as shown,"The door mat is just ok--the actual item received does not match the picture on the website at the time of the order (12/17/11). I was ordering based on the image as much as the description---the doormat pictured looks really cool, the one received is plain and boring. I could return the item, but it's a gift and there isn't time to order something else. Normally Amazon's images are accurate, but in this case it is not. Hopefully they update the image with the correct picture."
2,Well rounded picture of Fredrick the Great,"I am a picture person and this book is jam packed with many color plates depicting various aspects of Freddie and his environment. One plat shows a map of Frederick's battles. For collectors there is a picture of a gilded snuff-box set with diamonds with a miniature of the King. To know some one you must know their background and environment.Then when you read about their actions you get a feel for the reasons behind these actions. What was going on the world around Freddy that help mold him?In this book Nancy Mitford takes the blur of many wars and focuses them through the eyes of a single great leader. Nancy Mitford has a good track record as a history writer of this era. You may want to read more of her books for a fuller background.This book is divided into twenty to chapters usually separated by wars, a section on resources, and an extensive index."
1,the cat walking around was the highlight,tons of stuff makes no sense at all movie tries to be all epic and memory flashback the accent of the businessman was kinda awesome that dude woulda had WAY more muscle hired to defend him by the way a few fingers chiseled off were also nice other than that this movie sucked main guy looks liek shorter streve segal face scrunched like hes needing to take a dump thoughout the movie
2,Always Evolving!,"As with most great records, Summerteeth requires the listener to give it undevided attention. From the beginning pop/funk exstasy of 'Can't Stand It' to the mellow finish of 'In a Future Age, this album continues to unfold and develope. Sure this band isn't for everyone, but that's what makes them so darn good. I've been waiting for a band like Wilco to come along and challenge my ears, and it's great to never be disappointed with their music. Buy this CD!"
2,Love this fragrance,"Oscar De La Renta has always been my favorite. I paid half of what I pay in fine department stores. It arrived in 24 hours, now that's fast."
1,Disappointed,I never received the product and had to get a refund. A first since becoming a customer of amazon.
2,Ready For Something Different?,"I've been a DJ for 27 years. currently US music is in a vast slump of unoriginal, uncreative, unartistic, sensationalistic GARBAGE. The new ""music"" I get every week mostly gathers dust waiting for a request. i've mixed and remixed 60's 70's 80's till I can't remenber what i just played so i have to keep a show log. so to put a different spin on things I have turned to World Music,to add a little flavor to the mix, I found Ishtar from the group Alabin my ears like the sound,my eyes were pleased by Ishtar and the rhythm moved my soul. I knew I had found the spice for my next dance mix. Don't mis Ishtar ""truly""Emet CD."
1,"Ok, but there are better swaddlers","I have used the small and large size of these swaddlers and wouldn't waste my money again. I have to wrap my son so tight for these to work, that I won't be using them anymore. Too many nights he wakes because his hands escape. It's not worth the disrupted sleep. I liked that these were more affordable than the other ""miracle"" brand, but ended up wasting more money because these didn't work for me. Other swaddling blankets, such as the ""miracle"" blanket do not solely rely on wrapping tight, but also have other tucking aspects that make it effective. If you have a Houdini baby, don't waste your money."
1,It's a dog ...,"Quite a surprise for me to one star a James Jennings book but this must have been his evil twin brother .....The edition I got had Anonymous listed as the author .... and it deals with Alison that is deliciously bound in a tangel of relationships. The main sub characters are the handsome Stephan and with wily Catha a budding 'feminist' .....OK as the reader I felt that yes the girl got herself into a tangle, so much so I certainly could'nt figure out the pint. If that wasn't bad enough the characters are not very likable at all, so who cares ......What a waste of a tree ..."
1,Not the best,As a new mom I wanted to have a pretty bassinett for my little girl. This one was just that...pretty. That's about it. The pad is very thin and there is only one sheet and it is not very soft. If you have a child like mine who spits up in the night you will be washing this everyday. I also had a problem with the bassinett rocking even when it was locked. My baby would end up smushed against the side if she moved even a little bit. Not only was that scary but she didn't get any solid sleep because everytime se rolled to the side it woke her up. We have since brought our pack and play upstairs for her to use instead and she loves it. Save your money.
1,Arrived Broken,"I ordered this as a cute way of serving snacks for my daughters Girl Scout Daisy troop. It is very cute, but mine arrived broken as well. I am reordering, and hopefully the next one will arrive with better packaging."
1,Sony DRU-720UL,"This was a great burner until it stopped burning DVDs, after about 20 successful burns. It still burns CDs and reads DVDs, but every attempt to burn a DVD results in a ""power calibration error."" Same Memorex DVDs that used to work don't anymore. Searching the net revealed many other users of this product had the same problem. There is no fix. The product is now ready for the dust bin."
2,cute jewelry box,"I got this as a gift for a friend that collects music jewelry box. It is in fact bigger than the picture shows. I find it very cure, and my friend also like. It is adequate for a young girl's first jewelry box."
1,Am I doing it wrong?,"Like ""Amazon Shopper"" I too read many good reviews on this electric razor--both on amazon.com and several magazines. For the life of me I cannot seem to get a close shave, going back and forth over areas to no avail. The accompanying literature seems to say that the closest shave might not be obtained until after 30 days of use. Let me tell you, it has been 21 days and still terrible. In the meantime, you are not supposed to use a regular razor (presumably while your skin adjusts) so basically you're walking around as a stubbly gal, even though you are shaving every day! At least it hasn't cut me yet. I am very disappointed in this product."
1,"its suppuse to be rally,really BAD!!!!!!!","VAN HELSING is a kind of movie thatt talks a lot,and puases a lot!!!!!its the same old borring DRACULA story.its a VAMPIRE movie!!!!!actully its not 1 star!!!!!its.........0 STARS!!!!!!!i would give this a F- and give it a 10 out of 100!!!!!!(100 is the best)instead of 4 in- a- half stars it should be a poor:2 star.it looked good......but then it came DOWN,UP,DOWN,DOWN,DOWN to the dephs of atlantis.im telling you....ITS A STUPID MOVIE!!!!!!ill choose an action movie/DVD"
1,Worst Amazon product ever purchased,"Given mostly favorable reviews in the past, I was excited to order this music stand. I was extremely disappointed by the stand I received from Kaito. Firstly, the plastic packaging in which it came appeared used and dirty. The next clue was the stand's carry bag - embroidered with SIGNTURE - missing the A; upon assembling the stand my suspicions of ""knockoff"" were confirmed. Once of the extensions seemed dirty, maybe even rusty. It was impossible to secure the extensions such that the extension would stay extended, the knobs were poorly made, hurt your fingers to tighten, impossible to tighten fully and failed to hold the extensions in place (even my husband was unable to do it). Therefore, this stand definitely could not hold music or a music book. I would have given this 0 stars if pssible."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Whatever you do, don't buy this card. I've had one for a year, it worked great. Unfortunately Macsense has abandoned it, they are no longer doing driver development and it DOES NOT WORK with Mac OSX 10.4. I've discussed this with Macsense and they have no plans to upgrade the drivers to continue working with future versions of OS X, so it's worthless. Buy a card from a bigger company that will continue to support their products."
1,quick read,"The African Diary was written in Bill Bryson's usual humorous style, but it seemed like he just whipped out this book because of an obligation. I read it in less than an hour so it was less than entertaining."
1,Disappointment,"I had heard that this was supposed to be a Christian alternative to Harry Potter and that it had gone global because it was so good. I must have been reading the wrong newspapers. Sorry, this one doesn't work for me.If you want to read a good Christian fantasy, try Forrest Tales: The Secret of the Labyrinth. No witchcraft or occult. They get their supernatural powers from the brains we are born with. G.P.Taylor must have forgotten how to use his."
1,Crap,What a piece of crap. As of this post I've been waiting for cust support for 40 minutes and counting. The device keeps printing the same thing over and over. Won't reset.
1,Huh?,"I bought this album expecting something similar to the EBTG Back to Mine. However, I was very disappointed. I don't see how the tracks on this album could have inspired what Orbital has put out."
2,Street Fighter Volume 2,These book is amazing for real Street Fighter fans. The contains inside just couldn't stop you from reading it again and again.I just love it.
1,Amazon Sent me a dented item (someone elses return?).,"In all these years, I never got such junk from Amazon. It was not damaged in shipping to me. The inner box was all torn up. The pot was dented. No damage to outer box. I'll never order cookware from Amazon again. Do brick and mortar store would have put such junk on their shelf. To Amazon's credit, they did replace it. So, I finally got my pot after 3 weeks of hassle. I'll go to the local kitchen store next time."
1,STINKS! I'm only RATING b/c I have to!,I wish I could be more eloquent with my wording but I prefer honesty. What I have learned is I WILL NOT buy any more of these bogus biographies on Whitney. The majority of them (THIS ONE DEFINITELY) are done by self-serving wannabe artists cashing in on Whitney's death through people that sincerely loved and admired her gift. This dvd will go into the circular file (trashcan)! Don't waste your dollars.
1,Didn't work for me,I opened it and it was wraped in a plastic and it didnt come with a manual so I had to look it up online to find the instructions. At first i just plugged it in to see if it works right out of the box which failed. Then i process to download the software and it still didnt work so i ended up returning it out of my pocket and got a refund.
1,why pick Alfonso Cuaron?,"I love the Harry Potter books and the movie 1 and 2 but this is the worst one so far. I had high hopes for this move but it was a big let down. I know they had enough money to do more and put in alot more than they did. The only reason why i gave it a 2 star is because of the one person, Alfonso Cuaron he has not even made one good movie and I know movies very well. The only movies he should do is home movies! I just hope they dont cut alot out like the they did in part 3. Thanks for taking your time in reading this."
1,As hard as plywood can be,"Junk junk junk. I don't know why so many good reviews. It looks so comfy on the picture, but it is just a piece of plywood covered with nylon, no cushion at all. All the ""fluffness"" you see in the picture is the nylon fabric folded around the metal frame, giving the illusion of cushion. My baby is a chubby 4 month old and slides to the sides because the back is straight with no pillows or any cushion on the sides. My toddler (2years old) likes to climb in the chair but I have to remove the toy bar all the time... pain the the b. Now I understand why there is another model where the toy bar just swings in and out, without having to be removed. I want to return it but the assembly was such a pain as well, that my husband will be furious to have to unscrew everything again!"
1,Defies Belief,"I actually thought that there could not be a worser song than Vanessa C.'s last hit A Thousand Miles.She has proved me wrong with Ordinary Day,a really boring song.It had stupid lyrics and the tune can put insomniacs into a deep sleep.Avoid this song at all costs.Peace Out."
2,"Masterpiece! A definite ""Must Have"" for anyone!","Being completely obsessed with John Lennon happens to describe me perfectly! Out of all his albums, this definitely is at the top (along with ""Double Fantasy""!) I listen to this CD each night before I go to bed, and I'm sure my family is sick of listening to it---but it is a masterpiece. And I'll keep playing ""Mind Games"" forever...."
1,This cd is very bad,"I can't understand why any major label would stand behind this.The music industry is in a state is emergency - no less - and this cd is another example of that.The singing is terrible and the production is cheesy and thin.It's ironic that cds like this continue to flood stores, yet the labels actually get upset when people want to download it instead of buy it. Labels need to become more responsible..."
1,Fan of Futurama? Spend your money on the DVDs.,"Cel-style animation. Original voices. Cut scenes with all the off-beat humor of the original TV series. What's not to love?Well, in the ""not to love"" category we have: Weak graphics. Substandard (non-customizable) controls. Dumb missions. And a third person camera that absolutely defies player control.All in all, I thouroughly enjoyed the cut scenes, and spent much of the gameplay trying to gouge out my own eyes. Thanks a load, Fox Interactive."
2,Pretty awesome,"This is my 3rd pair of Sanuk's and I still love them. They have changed very little since my first pair. Probably the most comfortable shoe I own. They are great for casual outdoor wear, hitting the local pub,or even in the office (but I have to trim the frayed edges). I live in the city and they work great on the sidewalk. My only complaint is that I wore through the sole in my previous two pairs. That only happened after about 2 years of ownership but I still wouldn't mind a little more durability. I found that they initially fit a little snug, but they stretch to fit your foot really well after a few wears. Hope you enjoy them!"
1,Spooky teacher,"I felt like this DVD was structured in a really chaotic, choppy way. The routines contained a lot of pauses and standing around, and the woman's voice (Patricia Walden, I guess) wasn't soothing to me, but rather a bit trite and creepy. I also hated her yoga unitard, not that what she's wearing is that important, but you do have to stare at the teacher for most of the video. I would go with Yoga Topia instead!"
1,Ridiculous and Pointless!,"Sophie Jacobs sits in the car while her boyfriend, Hugh, gets some stuff in a store. The store is robbed with people shot. Everything else afterwards is either real or fantasy.(Hint: was Sophie a witness to the crime?)I chuckle when people see this type of movie and say that they guessed the ending within the first 5 minutes because I know that's not true, but in November's case, it's really true. There's a clip during the title credits that's a major spoiler.The movie itself is dull and lifeless. The story is told and retold with no direction. This movie is a build-up to the end which is a real let down. The only thing that's worth noting is the cinematography. The film moves from pale, to rouge, to finally a colorful shade. The acting is solid but who cares? The story is a disaster!"
1,Cheap,"I bought a dozen kitchen type turntables (different brands and sizes) to evaluate and decide which one could best be used as part of a marketing display prop. I needed 200 and I wanted to try them first. Of the ones I bought several were Rubbermaid and several were OXO.By the size, the OXO cost marginally more than the Rubbermaid. By quality, the Rubbermaid is far inferior to the OXO. So..if you clicked on this Rubbermaid turntable, have a look at the OXO brand before buying."
2,A must for FMV adventure fans,"This game is a lot of fun, with a creepy atmosphere that revolves around the disappearance of Agents Mulder and Scully. I've heard some complain that they wish Mulder and Scully were in the game more, but I think you still see enough of them to keep most fans happy, plus I found the character of Agent Willmore (whom you play) to be very likeable. The storyline is very strong, the puzzles make sense, and the full motion video (FMV) sequences are very good. There are not very many FMV games around anymore, so if you like your adventure games with video sequences, this is really a ""must have""."
1,brooklyn south,buyer beware is right. i bought brand new from amazon the first time and like the person said before me all the disc had fingerprints and marks on them. the picture would begin to break up and stop. i sent the set back to amazon and received the new package. all the disc have fingerprints and marks on them. I have not had time to play them yet.I will report on how the dvds play. I am very upset with the producers of dvds. they do not check the quailty of the product. but to amazons credit they do make it right when you have a problem with a purchase.
1,This is not Christianity,"If you attack this book, you are not attacking Christianity. If you want to learn something about Christianity, stay away from this book - read the Bible instead. Eadie consistently denies the foundational ideas about Jesus and salvation found in the Bible and therefore cannot be seen as a representative of Christianity any more than a Buddhist monk would be.Believe what you want about Jesus, but understand that Embraced By The Light is not talking about the same Jesus described in the Bible."
2,A very moving novel,"Set just prior to WW II, this is about a young boy in an industrial English city who goes to live with his aunt while his mother is in hospital for a breast operation. He starts getting in trouble - stealing candy, getting kicked out of the movies - trying to find his place. His dad is caught having an affair with his young niece, which doesn't help Joby work out his own difficulties at all. Barstow is an excellent writer, and in this novel he is quite poignant - especially at the end with Joby and his dad. Not quite as good as A KIND OF LOVING, but right up there. Barstow is a major post-war English novelist."
2,"Brillant, best buy for saves the day fans!","Excellently written both musically and lyrically. True it is different from the other albums but like people, band's music evolves and this is good example of that change.Any Saves the Day fan who can understand that will love the new album. On first listen I couldnt decide whether this was an album I would love but after the second listen I found myself humming the tune and singing along. A more mellow sound but still captures Chris Conley's outstanding talent and the band's quality of music is still as incredible as always."
1,Bye Bye Bye N'Sync!,"After hearing Bye Bye Bye I was quite looking forward to buying No Strings Attached, thinking that such an impressive first single would indicate an impressive sophomore album. Just goes to show you you really CAN'T judge a book by its cover. N'Sync takes the term ""sophomore slump"" to entirely new levels. Overproduced, overprocessed, and utterly unlistenable. They might've broken BSB's record for first week album sales, but I know what true talent is. And it comes in the form of five men named AJ, Nick, Howie, Kevin and Brian. Enjoy your 15 minutes of fame JC, Justin, Joey, Chris and Lance. Your days are numbered."
2,I Love L.A.,"Didn't know much about Randy Newman coming in..got this CD for one song in particular. But as I spent time listening to the entire compilation, I learned to apprectiate Mr Newman's unique style and flavor. In the booklet that comes with the CD, Randy Newman gives us short thoughts on each song contained in this collection. Though short, I got a nice glimpse into this musician's thought process.The booklet also contains some useful info on each song as well as a handful of photos of Randy Newman himself. I know all this stuff could be found on the internet, but still nice to have it included nonetheless. Mr Newman is a soulful storyteller who expresses himself through song. His work is here for you to enjoy. So enjoy it."
2,Kindle Foibles,"Comments from an engineering perspective: 1)I'd like to see the power switch on the side, top, or bottom. 2)I've had to use velcro to keep it in the case. 3)The elastic band is cheap, cheap, cheap, and doesn't retain its form. 4)The 'Experimental' mode is just that. If you load music, there is no way to select the tune you want to play. Needs LOTS of changes.Comments from a reader's perspective: 1) The display couldn't be better. 2) The page changing selectors are good, but not great. 3) I love the ability to take my books anywhere and everywhere. 4) Downloads are easy and quick. 5) I especially like the ability to preview the first chapter of a book of interest. OVERALL: I think the Kindle is worth the money and I'd buy it again. The small things I dislike will probably be corrected in newer versions, at least I hope so."
1,Poorly made re-production,This review is is relation to the condition of the actual book.Very poor quality copy of the book. The pages are all unequal and jaggered. It is practically falling apart at the seams.Suggest NOT buying this book
2,A movie that makes you wonder,A movie that you can sit and watch and feel alive.A place with more content than you can you can see in two hours. The view is someplace you dream about. The howl is chilling.There is definitly not another movie like it anywhere.
2,This is the book you need,"This book is an incredibly comprehensive approach to the LSAT ""games"" section. Whereas other books give you broad tips on how to tackle the games, this book tells you how to handle every type of game the LSAT offers, what type of diagram to use, where to draw your diagram, and how to move quickly. If you are willing to work hard to do better on the games section, but are unclear about how to accomplish it, this is the book you need.There are clearly people out there who find the LSAT ""games"" section a breeze, but I'm not one of them. I tried a couple of the other books and am even taking a Princeton Review class, but nothing is as good as this book."
1,Aerobics disguised as yoga,"I love Denise Austin. Before I discovered yoga, I used to work out with her morning show every day and did so for years. She was very encouraging and optimistic, and she's a good *aerobics* instructor. However...this DVD is basically Denise's attempt to fight the fact that she (professionally speaking) is becoming obsolete. The last worthwhile video she came out with was ""Blast Away 10 Lbs"". She needs to stick with stuff like that, because she's great at it, and leave the yoga videos to someone else.The warm-up was completely insufficient, the poses and their proper form is not explained, and I'm sorry, but when it comes to yoga there is no such thing as ""4 more counts then repeat on other side"" or ""up, down, up, down, keep moving"". The poses are moved through at too quick of a pace to feel their benefits. I just don't like this DVD...if I want to do aerobics, I'll do aerobics, but the next time I do yoga, it won't be with this."
2,"Lukowski - that's my family name, Thank you Mr. McNally !","My borther Daniel is a masseuse in NY. One of his clients is Mr. Terrence McNally. When the book was being written, Mr. McNally did my brother and my family a great honor - the central characters' last name was to be Lukowski. What can I say but thanks !"
1,Don't waste your money:,"I thought it was a dumb, vulgar and a waste of money and time.I am a Mark Wahlberg fan, but was very disappointed that he would stoop to doing such a dumb movie."
2,A true love story...,"This story got me from the very first page. The writing style is so descriptive, I love that. Kirk Martin has a way of writing that makes you feel like you are actually there, actually part of the story. You can feel the cold morning walks and smell the smoke from the chimneys. Okay enough about the writing style, let me talk about the story. It was equally amazing. It is the story of a love that somehow endures several separations but triumphs in the end. I loved the main characters, I could relate to them and their struggles. I cried so much at the end of the book BUT felt hopeful. Believe in love and it will come to you."
2,all information is good information.,The more you know the better your chances are. A lot of knowledge in a little book.Vegas Hustler
2,Nutrition that Heals,"This is certainly the best book on nutritional healing that we have found in Spanish. I own all four editions of this book on nutritional healing and we have successfully used all of them over the years. Now our friends who only read and speak Spanish can benefit from the sound advice found in them with this translation of the second edition. We anxiously await the translation of the latest edition. A few names of herbs and nutritional supplements are still in English. A little annoying, but we help our friends with their questions in Mexico where we live."
1,Good movie... shame about the DVD,"The merits of the movie aside - and I consider it to be a very good film - this DVD is horrible. I understand that the care (normally) taken by the major studios cannot be lavished on small movies such as this, but there is really no excuse for how bad this film looks. The dark scenes, in particular, look just plain horrible.It's a shame, as this really is a good movie. If you're desparate to own this film, then go ahead. But if you're looking at this as an impulse buy I'd recommend leaving well alone."
2,NOT MUCH TO DISLIKE ABOUT THIS ONE,"What a neat idea for a book. The book is quirky enough to allow the adult to enjoy the entire read with the child. The art work is excellent. The information given is all correct. The details are great and we have the added benefit of some great humor. This sort of gives us a worms eye view of the world. As another reviewer has also pointed out, the book is just full of bits that can lead to long discussions with a class or with your child. this is certainly one you need to add to your collection or library. I enjoyed ever page of it."
2,"Very soft, does what is says","Yes, this is all that it's cracked up to be. it shears out your make up beautifully to look natural."
2,Two for the price of one,"Included in this book are TWO superb stories following the ongoing story of Deep Space Nine, as begun in the television series and as continued in a very good run of books, most recently (prior to this book) in ""Unity"". Each of these stories is about 200 pages, but neither of them seemed particularly short; I was surprised when I checked that they weren't each full-novel length. The first follows events on Cardassia in the aftermath of the Dominion war, the second follows the characters of Shar and Prynn on a trip to Andor. Both are extremely well-written and would have been worth the price of a full novel on their own."
1,Disappointed,"My son is 20 months old and addicted to the Wiggles, he has been really pleased with Magical Adventure, Wiggle Bay and Wiggly Safari watching them over and over so I thought this would be the next one on our list and he and ""we"", my husband and I, are disappointed, it did not hold our attention far less my son's. Like one other person had mentioned, my son, like their child wanted the ones we already owned back on like mentioned above along with Top of the Tots so Cold Spagetti is certainly cold, not playing in our house :o("
2,Great,"This is a great thermostat so far!! No issues, super easy and fast to install. There is a jumper included so the system will accept multiple setup scenarios. I have a 4 wire system and this is perfect! Allows set up for Mon-Fri with 4 time periods / temps all user set. Same for Sat and Sun settings. It is fairly intuitive and the instructions are very clear. There is also a handy printout on the inside cover for quick reference in case you want to change your setting after tossing the instructions. Comes with 2 screws and the drywall anchors. Uses 2 AA batteries, haven't had it long enough to report on the drainage though."
2,10 degree is right for half blind dovetails,This bit is for a half blind dovetail using 1/2 inch stock CMT bits are a good alternative to Leigh bits.
2,Super PCI Card but only for Windows 98 or 95,"This is great card but it will not play good in Windows XP or 2000.So beware, if you run windows 9X , you will love this card.If u have old PC like me that missinng AGP slot this card is great, games play good picture is amazinng quality, TV tuner and so on.For windows 98 this card is worth every penny!"
2,One of the Best Books I've Read in a Long Time,"Water for Elephants has it all- adventure, drama, romance, history, and the circus! What more can you ask? Seriously, read this book."
2,Is there a funnier comedian? I submit to you there is NOT!,"If you want to put a CD in your car and laugh and laugh and laugh some more then Brian Regan's LIVE CD is what you need. I saw him years ago on HBO and I laughed until I cried. I have this CD and his routines, his voice and his ability to take the mundane and make it hilarious is pure genius. The CD starts off with his take on saying the words ""You Too!"" in conversations and then using it (accidentally) when someone says something to you.It's a family friendly CD (a couple of ""hell"" words, but nothing else) and when you are down this CD will perk you up and you will laugh despite having heard these skits which range from your school science fair projects, playing right field in little league and people who can't buy donuts!Buy this CD. It's some of the best comedy you will ever enjoy."
1,Beware of this camera,"I purchased this camera thinking that the reviews I had read and Nikon's reputation for quality were a good indicator that I was getting a multi-faceted ultra compact digital camera. Big mistake.This is one of the worst digital cameras I have ever used. Pictures turn out extremely dark, blurry, or both. I have fiddled with every available setting, and still picture quality is inferior to my 4 year old Olympus 3 mega-pixel that I was replacing!The delay in the picture taking process is painful. If you are tryinig to shoot anything other than a landscape shot, be prepared to have your subjects sit absolutely still or risk blurry pictures. Forget about handing it off to someone unfamiliar with the camera -- they won't be able to get a 1/2 way decent shot off.I have a Treo 650 with a a built in camera that takes better pictures than this sham of a camera.Beware - don't buy it. Look elsewhere."
2,"Good phones...for the price, anyway","The Koss Porta-Pro looks delicate, but its folding design belies a hardiness that competitors should try to emulate. All headphones require a ""burn-in"" period before they sound their best, and that's certainly true of the Koss Porta-Pro.After burn-in, they show themselves to be equal to their reputation. Retailing between $30 and $40 or so, they offer good fidelity at low to medium volume, but grate a bit when pushed too hard. The Porta-Pro works nicely with a variety of musical styles, pop and rock to jazz, but occasionally has trouble with the distortion levels of punk; this may not be a problem with most listeners.While the sound is clear and offers fine fidelity, songs often lack ""color"" -- a common complaint with less expensive headphones. Yet, compared to its competition, the Porta-Pro offers a much cleaner sound; no irritating bass thump on these phones.These are the iPod phones of choice."
2,A POIGNANT TRANSFORMATION,"Richard Rodriguez shares how education transformed his life forever in this searing, poignant, candid autobiography. He became a confident, capable, knowledgable, strong individual who could speak, write, debate, communicate with others beyond the comfort zone of his immediate family. He ultimately amazed elite scholars with his brilliance, but he writes that he lost the close, warm loving affinity with his family, his roots. He is painfully candid. His courageous stance on both bi-lingual and affirmative action programs may make some readers uncomfortable, but his reasoning is sound.Read the book. It is an honest attempt to portray one man's journey from illiteracy. It is the american dream gained, and a detailed passionate account of the price one man paid to achieve it."
1,This DVD is horrible,"DO NOT BUY THIS! I bought it, thinking it would be cool/fun...it is complete garbage. You can make your own ""collection"" with a VCR and it will come out 100% better. Do yourself a favor and ignore this temptation."
2,"More Moore, please! Finish the collection!","The MTM Show brings back lots of memories from the past when ""TV sitcoms were funny!"" Reality programming didn't exist in the 70s and thus creative writers were truly appreciated by the viewing public. My TV isn't on much anymore in the evening. Shame."
1,Stack of whack,"It seems some people will write ANYTHING to squeeze a nickle out of a republican's pudgy fingers.... this woman is certainly one of them.... I guess all those VietNam soldiers and anti-war 'hippie' heroes, both living and dead were wrong about the lies created by republican-led war-hawks exposed for thier mis-leading atrocities over all these years... especially the profits gleaned by selling such chemicals as agent Orange: a substance that to this day has the Native-born Vietnamese women still delivering mutated babies... This kind of muck makes me sick whenever I see a slick liar feebly attempting to cover up an older lie. -Little woman, please!"
2,Amazing and beautifully performed,"WOW! This album is so powerful the music practically jumps out of my CD player. Even more impressive is Rice put it out as an indie album without the containmation of marketing geeks. His lyrical vision and the soulful presence in his voice are captivating. My teenage daughter loves it, too. My great-grandfather was William Henry Rice from Dublin so Damien might be a distant cousin. Regardless, DON'T MISS THIS ALBUM. Christine Rice"
1,Mis-representation of this item by Amazon.com,I just received the Tutto Carra ITALIAN Version of Rafaella Carra and what a surprise! Although all the track tittles mencioned in the prodcut description at amazon are in Italian and the name Tutto Carra is Italian I ended up with the Spanish versions of her songs. Unacceptable. I am giving this one star because of the mis-represetnation and I did my homework trying to make sure that the item is the one I wished for. I love Rafaella and her songs do bring back memopries but I wanted the original italian version of her songs not the Spanish one. I will try to send this back and let amazon sort things out!Buyer beware!!!
2,Finally a great cordless phone,I recently purchased this phone about 2 months ago and have waited for something to go wrong with it like all of my other phones. I have been extremely happy with this one. Sound and clarity is wonderful and keeps it's clarity even when I am outside with it watching my kids play. Battery life is good. I have nothing bad to say about it. It was simple to set up and easy to access from remote locations. I am now going to purchase an extra handset since I am so pleased with it.
1,A cheap Cartridge,I mounted this cartridge (SHURE 97x) in my turntable DENON-500M (MX135+MC-252+B&W; 804D) and have been so disappointed with its quality.Once you use another cartridge like Denon DL-110 you could easily get the same conclusion. I tried to test it by listening few classical music lps as well Peter Green (old FleedwoodMac) and some Jimmy Hendrix LPs. I could tell Shure 97Xhas a weak bass and there is a lack of clarity between different range of frequencies.
1,You either love it or you hate it...,"and I hated it! I did not think it was funny at all. The characters did not invoke anything in me. There are so many people who think this movie was one of the best, they are entitled to their opinion, but I would never recommended anyone to see this movie."
2,Powell and Lombard,Excellent examples of 1930's comedies. I find watching 1930's comedies very relaxing and enjoyable.
2,WAGNER IS GOD,"Wagner, quite simply, was the best composer that ever existed in the history of this universe. He created an art form that was not music, not poetry, not drama, not ""art;"" it was, in short, a combination of all of the above, in equal proportions. I can't quite put it all into words, but I must say that in order to truly understand Der Ring des Nibelungen, and indeed all Wagner, you must study the works in depth.Solti was also a fantastic composer, and certainly conducts this opera cycle wonderfully. If you wish to hear what Wagner should sound like, and hear an ""accurate"" yet emotional rendition of Der Ring... then you simply must buy this."
1,Terrible storyline with corny dialogue and no excitement.,"I'll admit that the book could have been good. At first I thought it would fairly good. Once you get into it though, it will begin to bore you. The countless historical inaccuries as well as the corny dialogue makes this a terrible book. This doesn't even attempt to capture the spirit of the Titanic. If someone wants to write about the Titanic they should at least get the facts right."
2,Inexpensive and great,"I have owned this watch before. It is perfect for the job I do where I use the timer and stop watch functions, but also need something inexpensive as I scratch them up at work. I usually have to buy one every couple years because the band (plastic) wears out or it needs a new battery. A battery at the shop near my home is $10 so for $3 dollars more I can just get a new one. I have found these watches at Walmart and Target but they are $19.99. Had this in about a week so I was a bit disappointed in that...but it was the week between Christmas and New Year's holidays so understandable."
1,early greece,"this book is held in high honors by historians, but in contempt by archaeologists - and for good reason. if you want to understand a period of human history from which the literary evidence is virtually non-existent, you must incorporate other sources of evidence in your treaty. murray does not, and his vision of archaic greece is thus vastly different to the view of robin osbourne, whose ""greece in the making"" is a much better treatment of the archaic period than this. oswyn murray, although a vastly skilled historian and a wonderful scholar, just does not get it right.if you have no idea of what is going on during the 7th and 6th centuries BC and have this book at hand, by all means read it - but please keep in mind that there are much better treatments of the period available."
1,Sooo Predictable,This book was sooo predictableObvsiously Jack had some mysterious secret...take a guess at what that was--duh.Kathryn and Robert...predictableIt took more than half the book for the pase to pick up
2,L' Orfeo ... Sublime,"This production of L' Orfeo by Claudio Montverdi is absolutely remarkable in every way. Jordi savall has surpassed himself, and so too the stage production manager, Gilbert Deflo. This period piece is perfectly suited not only Jordi Savall and his orchestra, Les Concert des Nations La Capella Reial de Catalunya, but also to Barcelona's magnificent Gran Teatre del Liceu. The Opera's opening scenes are nothing less than pure grace, both to see and to hear.The music is so sensitively conducted and played that it defy's the senses and one is transported immediately into a state of aural euphoria. This is a must have for admirers of period productions, it is utterly brilliant!Stephen Moore."
2,Wonder's masterpiece,"This fantastic album appealed to so many sectors of the music business from its day of release. It is a superb mix of catchy pop, gospel, soul and a touch of jazz fusion. At the time of its release, I was a grumpy teenager, into progressive and West Coast rock, and highly resistant to soul music. But along came this perfect double LP -- early copies came with a free EP containing four tracks that frankly aren't quite as great as the rest -- and suddenly all the DJs I respected were playing it. I remember even the UK's John Peel dumping his normally punk-laden agenda, on his late-night Radio 1 programme, in order to devote a couple of hours to this gorgeous record. I cannot highlight a single track -- all are magnificent. This remastering means that I've now bought two CD versions of this album. Should I give the earlier version to my brother? No, I'll keep it for the car!"
2,Some people...,This was a very funny movie. I saw it awhile back and was just curious as to what other people thought. The guys that gave it 3-5 stars definitely got it right. I was reading the 1-star reviews and just got pissed off. What's wrong with people? What were you expecting from this movie? It was loaded with hilarious scenes. You got these clowns bad mouthing the movie I suppose because I guess it wasn't a groundbreaking thought provoking movie. Get out of your own asses
1,Never Received!!!,"I Have never received my book and it has been a long time, still waiting. . . . . . ."
2,Meet Me in St. Louie,I thought it was a fabulious move and the critque was really good gave great insights on the stars and V.Minelli
1,Bad dvd,"The movie of course was great, but the quality of the dvd was very poor, we get to almost the end of the movie and it started breaking up into all those tiny pixels, quite annoying!! I should have returned it, but what a hassle."
2,It really works!,My Mother In Law gave this to me with my first pregnancy and it worked. Back then I only used it on my stomach because that is the only place I thought I would have stretch marks. So of course I didn't get stretch marks on my stomach but did on other areas. The next two pregnancies I learned to use it all over and since then never got any more stretch marks. It really does work!
1,Terrible,"This book is rife with mistakes. For example, incorrect vocabulary is provided in the lessons. Also there are errors in the answer section. I'd consider returning this book if were possible. I'm concerned that I'll be learning inaccurate vocabulary along the way. The worst of it is that there aren't very many of such books out there. Build the cost of a dictionary into the price of this book. You'll need it."
1,Two stars for trying,"Mr. O'Reilly really does attempt to appear fair. I like his probing questions of powerful and famous people. However, he only throws hard questions to people with liberal ideas while ignoring the right. Once you realize that his heart is just not into probing too deeply anyone who thinks like him all appearances of fairness vanish.""No-spin zone"" name should be ""no-win zone"" for anyone who differs with him. Afterall, he decides what questions to ask and what to put in his book. Waste of someone who could make a difference if he was truly impartial."
1,bad design makes this travel version extremely frustrating,"The flimsy blue bottom parts make this game frustrating, even for older kids. Don't waste your money. We could barely keep it working upright at home, let alone on the road!"
1,Be a Babywhisperer instead,"I would never follow the advice of this book. It seems to me that it creates more sleep problems than anything. Children are perfectly capable of falling asleep alone if you begin them right. The advice of the Babywhisperer is right on and works to gently teach babies that they can fall asleep and stay asleep. Following the Babywhisperer's advice, my babies have slept 12 hours straight by 10 weeks of age. This is with NO crying. Also, naps are with NO crying. Wake up people!! This approach is sooo unrealistic and you are sure to NEVER have a good night of sleep again."
2,Another GREAT Jack Reacher Story!,"I am deeply, madly in love with Jack Reacher. Just this description alone on page 9 had my panties tingling:""He was six feet tall, and he had weighed 220 when he left the Army. A month after joining the swimming pool gang, the work and the heat had burned him down to 210. Then the next two months he had built back to 250, all of it pure hard muscle. . . He was burned a deep brown by the sun and he was in the best shape of his life. Like a condom crammed with walnuts, is what some girl had said.""I enjoyed the plot twists which kept me guessing up until Jack took a bullet for his true love. . . Ah, fiction, where would us girls be without our big, bad-boy, macho IMAGINARY heros? Thanks, Lee Child, for another great Reacher thriller. Looking forward with much anticipation to your next one! ;-)"
1,Broken,"This Item was recieved quickly but was just a shattered peice of useless glass when it got here, thanks alot"
1,HORRIBLE,"This DVD is absolutely horrible. The production quality is terrible and the narration is practically incomprehensible.It looks as if someone ran around on a cloudy day with a hand-held camcorder and shot vacation-quality videos. Finally, the colors are completely washed out, and most of the shots are taken on cloudy days, and this choice of weather exacerbates the inherent poor production quality.FYI - I returned the DVD to Amazon for a full refund.Please try these Amazon DVDs on India instead:1) The Soul of IndiaThe Soul Of India2) Ancient India: A Journey Back in Time (Lost Treasures of the Ancient World)Ancient India: A Journey Back in Time (Lost Treasures of the Ancient World)3) Warrior Empire - The Mughals (History Channel)Warrior Empire - The Mughals (History Channel)"
1,Major difference of opinion,"The two previous reviewers found great worth in the book--I cannot disagree more strongly.The book is filled with simple anecdotal information that leaves the impression of a quick visit to each of these places as the brevity of the text attests. There are no maps to help orient the reader. The book left me disorganized and certainly did not convey an urge to visit many of the cities, towns and villages found in the book."
2,Awesome product!,"This is the perfect coffee maker for dorm rooms! It makes one up, at a decent rate and it has a reusable filter!!! A++++"
2,VINTAGE FILM FITS THE BILL AND BILLING,"If you are a fan of Bob Mitchem's, which I'm happy to say I am, you'll like this film which shows Mitchem at his classic best. The director of this one surely knew what he was aiming for and succeeded in getting it."
1,What is this?,"I have no idea what I am listening to. TD has been such a great instrumental group, but, with vocals they fall completely flat. As another reviewer wrote, it may be a good show to see but leave the lyrics out of it."
1,Roller Clips Much Too Short,"The clips that hold the roller in the hair are much too short. Rollers fall out. If clips were longer, they would probably work. Suggestion: Make longer clips. Other than that, It's looks to be a nice product even though I wasn't able to try it out."
1,Collectors Wanted,"All I can say is... if you really like Sailor Moon and you're a rabid collector, go right ahead a purchase this book. If not, you'd be better off saving your money for something else. Such as, say, a Fushigi Yugi book!"
1,You all are wrong,"All of those people that gave this cd 4 or 5 stars must not have heard either of his 1st 3 cd's. Everything after and then there was x was a poor attempt to make some money. His 1st 3 cd's all were good. This cd does have some good songs, but overall, I am once again, disappointed by dmx's attempt to make good music after and then there was x. It shows in his record sales."
1,Dreary,"Nafisi writes a book that might be of interest to high school students of English literature, but even her literature insights are prosaic. Her story of Iran is very dull. Her major act of rebellion was to read ""forbidden"" books, but people were always free to read them in the privacy of their own homes.Nafisi fails to present any interesting political insights. The result is that she seems unaware, and one suspects this type of mental retreat isn't very healthy."
2,Very good read with alot of enlightenment.,Great! It was well worth the wait. A book that will be a value to my collection and will be read on numerous occasions.
2,"Funky, uplifting and original, best of british!","I loved this album! It's nice to have an album that you can sing along to, that isn't deep and is just good fun to dance to! I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys dancing around the room!!"
2,EXCEPTIONAL AND INFORMATIVE,"Overcoming Dyslexia is an excellent read. This book is filled with very valuable information, backed by scientific data that supports solutions for managing symptoms of dyslexia. Dr. Shaywitz shares her knowledge and experiences in support of this very difficult learning opportunity. If you have questions or concerns about dyslexia, this is a must read."
2,"Liked the book, disliked the author","Satisfying literary thrillers don't come along too often, so I'm grateful to Colin Harrison for his combination of complex plotting, subtle characterization, and good writing. I did like this novel overall, but it was in spite of its endless, arrogant philosophizing and its offensive sexuality. I don't recall ever being offended by a book in this way before--the female characters' sexuality bears no resemblance to that of real women--it's clearly one giant fantasy on the part of the author."
1,Was Great While it Lasted,"This product worked very well, while it worked. Used it for a multiple state road trip and it worked all there and back and then some but then suddenly quit working after less than a month after purchasing it. It didn't melt like I see others have had the problem of melting, it just plain does not work. No power passes through it, I don't know if the problem lies in the plug or the three extension holes. Of course, I cannot return it or exchange it as I was apparently only given 30 days to do this in. Guess I should have heeded negative reviews more than I usually do, not that I ever completely ignore them, but usually I realize the product should fall somewhere between the good and bad reviews. Not in this case!"
2,Great Story,"I've always loved ""fast"", so naturally I love fighter jets. Hearing and seeing the story from this view was really cool. I would recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys seeing how humans accomplish truly great things."
2,A heavy hitter,"I'll keep this simple and to the point. The lens is bullet proof. It produces beautiful images even in low light situations and that's even hand held.Only one minor complaint, it's pretty heavy. I guess that's a small price to pay for beautiful photos and dependability. You get a bit of a work out, but who isn't in need of that."
2,great collector's disc,"This is a benchmark album that slipped Chuck Mangione into the mainstream public's awareness. Simple yet affecting arrangements. Each time you listen, the more you pick up the delicate personal phrasing brought to life by the individual members of the group, artfully showcasing their free-standing, exceptional talent."
2,Not your average historical mystery...,"While this book was released in the vein of The Davinci Code and the historical mysteries that strived to copy that beast of fiction, it finds a nice niche with its compelling story of the complicated relationships between 4 college roommates.The main mystery is found in trying to figure out who authored an ancient text known as the Hynerotomachia and what the purpose of its writing was. It turns into a compelling story on a number of fronts. There are murders, betrayals, and action throughout to stir the adrenaline, but the strength of the story lies in the choices that Tom (the narrator) must make. He juggles the woman he loves, with the friends he needs, with the ghosts of his father.The end tends to drag along, but the authors do a wonderful job of lulling you into complacency at the end, only to spring a good ending.This book is far from the best I have read, but worth a look on a boring weekend."
1,"An early novel, misunderstandings misguided romance. Ho-hum","Although I am a raving Putney fan normally, this early novel was quite boring, I thought. Lovers are crossed by their own misunderstandings of their own feelings and their ""duty"" as they see it. In the end, the proper pairings result, but by that time, They seem so separately and equally witless that I had ceased to care."
2,What a joy! Imbues each day with magic and meaning.,"In a world where our dreams and culture are shaped by Big Money interests, what a joy to rediscover and reaffirm the rich cultural diversity of our planet and the pervasiveness of the goddess throughout the world. The small daily rituals that anyone may perform lend magic and meaning to each day. I look forward in the morning to which goddess comes next (and haven't cheated by looking ahead yet!) A brilliant concept, Ms. Telesco, wonderfully executed and fascinating. More icing on an already nourishing cosmic cake? If you publish another edition and your publisher gives you more page space, please include an illustration or symbol of each goddess."
2,The BEST... nothing less,This book is one for all you mega mind wizards. This will get you thinking and working.
1,BEWARE!,"This is an example of why Osprey books need to treated with great caution. The book purports to be a source for Medieval Russian military history, yet it is full of errors, overgeneralizations, and poor analysis. This is NOT a fair assesment of the Russian realms or their armed forces in the period in question. I understand that there is only so much that can be done in this type of short format, but this is awful. I felt like I was reading college-freshman book report with a bunch of (granted, nice) images attached."
1,Way too expensive,"Love our Oral B Bruan, but think the cost of replacement heads is outrageous. They do a great job but it always pains us to have to buy and replace."
2,okay,"The fact that they include an HDMI cable is cool. However, this ""upconverting"" business is kind of a sham. Broadcasts in HD on digital cable are MUCH clearer than any DVD on this player. I have a 61"" Samsung DLP 1080p. Compared to an HD or Blu-ray, I think it's worth getting this player until the prices come down."
2,Having never played the game,"Having never played the game that this is based off of, I can honestly say that this is a unique and interesting tale - There are not many characters within these pages, but the ones that are here have depth and personality - I feel that the ending was a bit rushed, but it is left open for the sequel, so some time may be taken when you return to book number 2 - I think that the story was entertaining and fun and the excitement was good once things got moving passed explaining the history and the world - this is a solid four out of five stars"
2,Good first effort,"Don't know how old Kasey Chambers is, (from the look of the album cover, I'd say about 21) but this album smacks of a debut by a prodigy. Chambers has an excellent country music voice that makes her sound not at all like she's from her native Austrailia. She can also write a good solid hook or two as she does with the single ""Cry Like a Baby,"" ""The Captain"" ""You Got the Car"" and a couple of others. If this album has a flaw it is that there are a few less successful tracks in its second half. That said, the down home anthem ""We're All Gonna Die Someday,"" that closes the record might be the best tune while also sounding the closest to traditional country. It is, however, the song's sense of humor that leads you to believe that Ms. Chambers might have a long and satisfying career ahead of her.Overall, a solid debut album from a youngster who seems determined to become a star."
2,good price,"Well, I have only owned this for a day so I can't report on it's proficiency.I'm not using it to reduce odor from a litter box or diaper pail. I just bought it to reduce germs in the air, so how do I know it's working? I've been skeptic for a while, but I spotted one at Babies R Us today for only $12.98. That's the best price I've seen, so I figured I'd give it a try."
2,Incredible Classic,If you need a good laugh and a good cry this is one of those movie classics to enjoy. It's a heart warming film that will leave you inspired to grow your nails jungle red!
1,Fluff,"I like self-help books; I was tricked into buying this book because of its title. I was angry when I realized the book was simply one-page, drawings (poorly done) with comic one-liners. The book was offensive to me."
2,One Small Caution,"Excellent books. But be warned: you may have to translate some of the awkward phrases and expressions that seem to pop up throughout Cleary's books. I thought she might be European, until I read her bio today. Expressions like ""Gay"" (meaning happy) and ""Crayoning"" (which perplexed my daughter until I explained that in America we call it ""Coloring."")Things like that."
1,dont waste your time or money on this,"these headphones are quite honestly not worth 40 dollars. they have a horrible bass response and the mid-bass gets all mixed together-these things are to be avoided, if possibleif you want a decent pair of ear-buds (not really in-ear, but close enough) with BETTER sound quality, then i would reccomend the sennheiser mx300/400/500 line (~15$)if you are really a big spender...then i would recommend the etymotic er-4s (~300$). these are audiophile quality plugs and cannot be beat (just make sure you get the low impedance versions for portable use-cant remember if its the er-4s or er-4p)of course, there are others in between these two price ranges, but these are the only two that i have any experience with."
2,Great Depiction!,"Everything I've read about this event since viewing the film (which inspired me to research further) indicates that this was a faithful depiction of events. (In a discussion group on A&E, the son of one of the survivors agrees!) The jerky filming style in the midst of the battle adds to the queasy feeling we should ALL have in the pits of our stomachs at the idea of such devastation. It is WELL acted, avoids almost ALL maudlin sentiment (which can't be said of Private Ryan) and the knowledge that it really happened increases the impact of it. As an enthusiastic viewer of war films and amateur WWI historian, I HIGHLY recommend it."
1,A punishing experience!,"I opened this book filled with hope. There is no question that Tom Wolf can write but unfortunately he did not possess a brutal editor to go with the brutal writing and cut all that redundant verbiage. Hurricane hair was good the first time. The first time. The first time. I did enjoy the chapter about the rut of Charlie's stallion, First Draw, and found it to be the perfect metaphore for this ""tome"". I can not suggest this book to anyone that has a life and things to do. Perhaps if I were bedridden and an avid soap watcher then it would be a worthwhile read. Try something else if you are looking for characters with an ounce of depth or just plain old credibility. Was the author payed by the word? Ah, that explains it. The ending remained true to the horse metophore, a tease and nothing more."
1,bad movie!! horrible Sandra Bullock!!,"Sorry To say this, This movie would have been great with a younger actress. Sandra Bullock is to old for this kind of story!!!"
2,Great sippy cups!!,"We absolutely love these sippy cups and wouldn't think of giving our 16 month old son any thing else! They are spill proof but beware, they can potentially spill from the sides if sealed incorrectly. When screwing the ring on it's not necessary to seal tightly. For more info on this, you can visit the Avent website. The same is true for the regular Avent bottles as I already had this problem with them and was furious that the bottles were deffective, or so I thought. I went to the website to file a complaint when I came across the warning and was relieved to know the solution was so simple. I hope this info helps."
1,"If you like no taste at all, this is for you.","I ask myself what the hype is about this sauce, it comes in a cool bottle, it has a cool drawing on it, and it has the groundbreaking wooden bottle top, but what's inside. I have tried pouring a truly excessive amount of it onto my food, and I simply cannot taste the difference between food without Cholula and food with Cholula, and it's not about the heat or spiciness, I tend to be just fine with Tabasco or any other ordinary sauce. Finally I tried this on it's own, and all I can taste is vinegar. Then I thought, well, it must be organic or all great ingredients, but that's not the reason for the higher price either, there's plenty of artificial flavors and colors in here. So the hype here is really about the bottle. Sorry but you can get nice little bottles at any furniture store, as for the sauce, I'll continue to try something else."
1,Not to Happy!!!!!!!!!!!,"R e v I e w y o u r r e c e n t p u r c h a s e s, well!!! It would not let my wake up my computer form sleep mode, had to force-quit computer. Grrrrrrrrrrr!, Sent an email to Belkin and received no reply from them,Had to take my computer back apart and take out the Hi-Speed USB 2.0 5-Port PCI Card (Purchased on 09/02/2008)"
2,HILARIOUS,"Laid Off is truly comic genius! I watched this movie on a whim and was blown away with how much was done with the film on such a low budget. Each actor delivers their lines with great comic timing, especially the two leads CJ and Mike. This movie is so relatable and will definitely have anyone who watches it laughing hysterically!!"
1,FRAGILE,"Disc was fine, but box came cracked and pieces broken off. Maybe a cushion packaging next time. No harm done though!"
1,Does me no good....,The DVD that was sent was in Italian and not playable....it arrived three weeks after I ordered. Seems like it is in good shape but Cannot be played.
1,the meter stay in 7,i am not sure if the meter is working always stay on 7 most of the time. what is the issue? is it not workinghow is the reading is it correct?
1,ZZZZZzzzzzzz...,"Oh my, what can I say about this whispery little train wreck. It's third-rate coffee house music that struggles to be heard over conversations (as it should be). In the quiet sanctuary of my den, it's revealed for all it isn't. It isn't clever, musically or lyrically, and just drones along seemingly forever. My audiophile friends would like it because the sparse notes and little extraneous noises would make their overly analytical and fatiguing systems sound magical.Unless you're into performances that sound influenced by heavy doses of thorazine, don't bother."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book as with most books about J P Getty because it failed to talk about his home life in any detail. In particular, it failed to mention how he treated his wives, children, and grandchildren; how he refused to pay the ransom for one even though he knew about his whereabouts. It basically glossed over everyone he left behind, including his grandson William Paul Getty who celebrated his birthday one day after J P Getty's death.--Gummi Bear"
1,Tiny.,Much smaller than expected. Chain is dainty.Not appropriate for a guy. A bigger medaland heftier chain is what I was looking for.
1,don't know ?,I don't know ? see I paid for the system on was ripped off when all I got in the mail was a stinking power cord !
1,Too Heavy,"The website did not indicate how heavy these dishes are. I like the shape but had I known how heavy they are, I never would have purchased them. They take up much more room on the shelf and in the dishwasher. Also, they seem more for commercial use than for home use."
2,Fun for the ENTIRE family!!,"I'm an eighteen year old and when I reached for my last wrapped gift under the tree I could've sworn I knew what it was but my mom totally fooled me this time! It was ""Bop It!"" When I first looked at it I was like ""Um.... okay???"" But once I put batteries in and started playing, I couldn't put it down! It is so much fun! When my dad started playing it, he couldn't put it down either! It seems easy at first, but it REALLY does test your reflex skills not to mention concentration! I think this game is fun for the whole family! Everyone will enjoy it despite age, especially the kid at heart... like me! :)"
2,This video was GREAT!!,"`The Best of School House Rock' video was rockin'. My mom bought it for me because she remembers all the songs from the 70's and loved them too. The video covers different subjects such as History (No More Kings, Mother Necessity, The Great American Melting Pot), Anatomy (Them Not-So-Dry Bones, Telegraph Line), Grammar (Unpack Your Adjectives, Conjunction Junction, Verbs: It's Whats Happening) and Math (Elementary My Dear, Figure 8, 3 Is A Magic Number). Although I am 14, I enjoyed this video and have memorized some of the songs and sing them all the time. I think everyone should buy this video- any age."
1,"Great size, but. . .","I got this crock pot as an alternative to my larger crock pots, which often result in too many leftovers. The 2.5qt size is perfect for 2 people, and for smaller recipes like Mac N Cheese.Unfortunately, this crock pot is just too unreliable to use regularly. Even on Low, it cooks much too hot. This can result in burned or overcooked meals. Even worse, it has a hot spot. This means that if it's not stirred frequently during cooking - and thereby defeating most of the purpose of the crock pot - the food will burn and stick to the crock in that particular spot, even those times that the Low setting isn't too hot.In addition to the cooking problems, there is no ""Warm"" setting on this crock pot. Both of my larger crock pots have this feature, and while it is uncommon in smaller pots, I really miss it.I'll be putting this crock pot in the next yard sale and replacing it with theProctor Silex 3-qt. Slow Cooker."
1,Golf Lessons,"Much ado about nothing. Repetitive, self-serving, and generally not helpful. Golf is trial and error, there are fundamental technical skills that must be developed, and the feel-good approach does little for improvement."
1,"Tons of static, weak transmission",I found that the static was so strong with this product that I was constantly changing the channel settings to get a better signal (a totally clean signal was impossible). I wound up buying another transmitter which works great.
1,Don't be misled...,"This book IS NOT by Tom Osborne. It includes a foreword by Coach Osborne, but the cover and listing on Amazon are clearly intended to mislead people into thinking the book was authored by Tom Osborne. Nice marketing strategy, but bad publishing practice!"
1,One star is giving it too much credit!,"The worst design EVER. Literally do not buy if you want to save yourself a lot of actual headaches.I bought 2 after Sandy and hate them. The spout is super complicated to use and seal. The instructions on the container are not clear and are written in tiny script. (If you need instructions on spouts, it's too complicated!) I had to go online to their website to fully understand how to keep it sealed because the containers kept leaking.Even after reading and sealing it according to their instructions, I routinely found spontaneous leaks and the gas smells permeated my entire house and gave me constant headaches. I have had to put the containers outside and opened all my doors/windows. I am going to get rid of these containers because they are not worth the actual headaches I've been getting.I would have given it a zero if possible!"
2,Mapmaking with Children Exactly What I Was Looking For,"As a water educator for a local watershed organization, getting the idea of a watershed across to elementary school students can be challenging. This book focuses on kids developmental capacities and how they relate to a place at different ages. Not only perfect for classroom teachers, this book should be on the shelves of every environmental educator."
2,Beautiful Teapot,"I wanted to purchase this Villeroy & Boch Garden Fleurence teapot, it matches the rest of my china, but it was outragiously priced at Macy's and Bloomingdales. Amazon gave me a terrific price and quick shipping. I'm so happy with it!"
1,Grizzly H3278 nail and fastener bag,"I bought 2 of these, one the insides were not sown totally together so you couldn't seperate your nail sizes. I wouldn't tell anyone to buy this product. You get what you pay for David Baggett"
2,"It is so great, it almost never gets put away in the cabinet","This is such a great collander. I use it to wash fruit and veggies, drain pasta and so much more. I use it so much that it almost never gets put away. It fits nicely in the dishwasher and it stores nicely in the cabinet (when I'm not using it). It is a little more difficult to collapse than I had imagined, but it is not too bad and it is worth the price."
1,Disappointing,"I REALLY wanted to like this GPS (replaced an older Garmin). It is so sleek and visually appealing. But I couldn't get past its limitations and have returned it. I got frustrated every time I used it.Pros: beautiful, quick to get satellite, worked in my house(!), good POI info.Cons: Windshield mount is terrible! Very difficult to use, kept falling off. No other accessories are available at this time. I could have lived with that (I suppose), if the map software had been more user-friendly. When I wanted to look at the map, rather than be ""routed"", it was difficult and not very helpful - street names would disappear when you get the view widened enough to see more than your immediate surroundings. Some of the routing was strange also, and the voice prompt didn't start you out.I wanted to love it, but it is just not the device for me."
1,Didn't meet expectations,"I picked this up a while back expecting some tongue in cheek humor, maybe a little usable insight, but what I got was pure ridiculous. I hope that was how this book was written - for humor and not for anyone to actually follow."
2,Highly Recommend,I am very satisfied with this item. It is great with the store bought pads or newspaper. Neat appearance compared to just pads or newspaper and protects the floor.
1,Women of the Bible are always worth studying.,"John MacArthur presents women of the Bible in an easy-to-ready manner and I appreciate the depth of each presentation. However, our group of ladies was critical thinkers and if there were instances when speculation occurred on the author's part or if he interpreted the Scripture with a certain slant, we were able to compare those thoughts against the Word and determine for ourselves what the Truth truly was/is. A book can guide, as did ""12 Extraordinary Women"", but the Bible still is the ultimate study guide. The Bible is where life-changing verses can penetrate the heart and change lives."
2,wonderful adaptation,i really enjoyed all of these books as a kid and i totally apprecaite the way this was made into a movie.
2,Love Whip-It!,"True, this item isn't as cheap as a can of Reddi whip, but I know what I put into my whipped cream now. I put it on my coffee, icecream, my kids love it, my extended family find the flavor wonderful. My 3 year old will do anything for a blast of whipped cream, even clean her room spotless! :)For me, this is one of the best appliances I have ever bought and it is always in the fridge ready to go, for two weeks!I don't really find it money saving, although outside of the inital item cost, I don't find it any more expensive than buying one or two cans every week.LOVE IT! Great product!"
2,excellent,"I love this video. I am a huge fan of the 10 Minute Solution series. The workouts are great, and it's easy to talk yourself into working out for 10 minutes. After doing one segment you're pumped up and ready to try another. It's also great to mix and match segments from other 10 Minute Solution DVDs."
1,This sucks,"Of all the season review dvs's, this is by far the worst. This season review should have been a celebration of the 19th title, instead the producer has tried to show what he can do with editing. All the goals are filmed in strange angles and the commentary is from manutd.comIf I could give this 1/2 stars, I would.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!"
1,Jonah Hex: What happened?,"Why, oh why, did this film suck? It had so much potential when brought up at last year's Comic-Con, but like 2005's 'Constantine' before it, the cool premise went ker-plunk. I had an interest in JH when I first read a couple of '90s comic mini-series, which is where the supernatural parts got slipped in. They were great. This, on the other hand, should have been on cable or straight-to-video. Yeesh! Hold your nose and rent it once and wait for 'Cowboys And Aliens' in 2011 to hopefully get the stink out. (And Constantine should have been a Brit. Sorry Keanu.)"
2,Great Remote,"This is my second ""advanced"" universal remote and it rocks. Its got a great display, intuitive buttons and most importantly, the online setup works great. I programmed 10 devices in about 15 minutes and haven't had to change it yet. This is a great remote!"
2,Single greatest RPG experience ever created.,"This wasnt a game for me it was an experience, I loved everything about it and could not help but fall deeply and madly in love with the characters and story. The story was moving to the point where I was crying in several places and laughing in others. the character development is rich and something alot of games lack, they just dont draw you in like they used to. I looked up this game on youtube many years after playing it for the first time and couldnt help but sob all over again. this is one of the true classics."
2,Works as expected,"I ordered a hitch with the install kit. Item arrived on-time, and at the time I ordered, this was the cheapest price on the internet. I had it delivered to my auto mechanic who installed this in the truck for me. The only complaint is that the bolt holding the head to the frame was missing. A quick call to Reese and it arrived the next day in the mail. Very happy with this product.The slider on the hitch is great when maneuvering the trailer into tight corners. You can easily slide the hitch back away from the cab, allowing for an almost 90 degree turn. With the flip of a bar, the hitch will slide back to the towing position, allowing the weight to sit over your axels when driving down the road."
2,OMG Its about time!,"My boys have been wanting the Oddessey on dvd forever, and its only been found on old VHS. Why the wait for dvd?"
2,The Most Dangerous thing Ever,"This story takes place in Grand Island, Nebraska , it looked in present time. It was important, because there are twisters. The night of the twisters happend on April 3.This book is mostly about kids named Dan, Stacey, Rodney , when 3 different twisters hit Grand Island, Nebraska on the same night. They go look for the rest of their family. And then they find them and, they rebuild their before life.In my opinion this book was one of the best books I ever read, because it had the right characters for this book. I would recommend this book because it is entertaining and you can not put it down."
2,Great,"You know, i enjoyed this film. i thought it was quite creative and the universe that Lucas has created is quite believable. One thing you have to do is just simply accept that Lucas' dialogues are gonna be cheesy. me and my friends made fun of the cheesy romantic dialogue after we saw the film opening night. but making fun of the dialogue made the film more enjoyable.I was very pleased that R2D2 and C3PO were brought back for their comedic roles, which were absolutely hillarious!and i agree with many who have said that the last 45 minutes or so finally brought back some of the magic missing in the Phantom Menace, but sparkled throughout the first three films.And who can say anything bad about Yoda showing up at the end and proving why he is Master Jedi.keep up this feel Lucas with the last one, and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!! get someone else to help you with the dialogue."
2,Enteprising Women can truly shine,"I have enjoyed Vicki's style of speaking to her reader, as if she was right in the room with you. She coaches you and gets into your head and heart. She allows you to see the CEO in yourself. This book is not just for the nurses that have joined her company, but for every woman go wants to bring her own light to this dark needy world and make a difference. Even if it is one woman at a time."
1,A complete waste of time,"This is my third JMR book and I'm beginning to think ""A VISION OF LIGHT"" (which is quite good) must have been a fluke. I couldn't make it through Green Dragon and I'm not quite sure why I bothered to finish this one. Forgetting for the moment that the central plot is made ridiculous by the fact that NO ONE in this book seems the least terrified of the undying head who has sent thousands of others to their doom, it's simply bad writing. There are too many subplots; as a champion for our heroine, Sibille, Nicholas is laughable, but perhaps worst of all, somewhere about two-thirds of the way through the book, the author seems to have forgotten our heroine completely. Sibille turns into an almost minor character and when she finally reappears in the last couple of chapters she has lost her voice and we hardly care what happens to her anymore. Last, but not least, the number of typos in the trade paperback edition were extremely annoying."
1,A bed time story,"This book is definetly not useful for continuing to learn VB. I found it poorly written, boring, with various grammatical mistakes and vague examples that are not very practical."
1,Loved it for the first week - until it rained,"My whole family loved having a keyless entry lock - and it was easy to put in custom codes for various family members. However, after the first rainstorm it stopped working. Dried out after a couple of days and started working again - until the next rainstorm. Disappointed that a lock from such a well respected name brand performs this poorly."
2,"""Looking back in anger"" with a sad tune!","There's only one way to remember them:readingand humming the ""song""they inspire along thepoetical and invoking lines of an almost shamanicincantation rising to bring them back intolife so that we meet,know and re-bury them with love andawe,with respect and recognition ofa sacrifice as supreme as crucifying itself.They are all deities in the lost and sacredsociety bush of ancestors long forgotten and recalled when the moments aresupreme, when it comes to love, lifeand death: Beloved, Macon Dead, Violet, Circe..."
2,Excellent value,I was looking into buying either these or the sony street headphones. I noticed that these have a larger freq. response and greater sensitivity when looking at the specs. They were also cheaper than the sony's so I thought I'd give them a shot. I think they are WELL worth the price. The sound is awesome and I do not find them uncomfortable at all. They also look really cool. I would recommend these to anyone.
2,Denouncing the tendency to criminalize affected mothers,"The Postpartum Effect: Deadly Depression In Mothers by Arlene Huysman (a practicing clinical psychologist specializing in mood disorders) cites and explains a specifically defined clinical depression experienced by some mothers who are so stricken with this devastating condition that they were tempted to harm themselves or their children. Huysman also cites and explains common misconceptions about what can be a quite severe illness arising from the aftermath of giving birth. Denouncing society's tendency to criminalize affected mothers, The Postpartum Effect is a profound and welcome contribution to Parenting Studies, Health and Medicine Studies, and Psychology Studies dealing with Postpartum Depression."
2,Christmas natavity for grandsons,The set is adorable. Very is to play with andnot get scolded because it is a toy.
2,Great Book-A Keeper!,"I am a preschool teacher and used to check this book out all the time from the Tulsa library. ...I love this adorable, charming book and have many times related the story to fellow teachers! Children are totally fixated on the story as it is being read. The story is about a man who was too tired to do his dishes, with each passing day getting worse!Soon he has only a clay pot to eat out of. How the story ends is absolutely clever..."
1,"""Don't mistake lack of talent for genuis""","I've tried to like Radiohead for a long time now. I've really tried. But I just can't, and it amazes me that they've pulled the wool over the eyes of the majority of the world. I think people like this band because other people have told them they should, not because they're actually a good band. This is the most bland muzak ever created. There's no skilled musicianship and no hooks, nothing to listen for, and they're fronted by a guy who couldn't sing his way out of a paper bag. I couldn't think of a more highly overrated band. Best band on the planet? These guys aren't even the best band in their own genre. Look to bands like Coldplay or Catherine Wheel for decent Brit Art Pop. Seriously, Radiohead fans, these guys have you all fooled!"
2,Anti-Heroes Lost Shepherds Space Hookers...O my!,"I can't explain it, but you have to watch it. You'll fall in love!"
1,Hello Strunk and White!,"A book that aims to teach good writing, yet is itself often impenetrable, unstructured, and most damning of all, deathly boring. The authors would benefit from an open-minded re-read of Strunk's little book.For the record, I've been a voracious reader for 35 years, inhaling anything from trashy to highbrow, prose to technical writing. Nothing this book advised resonated with me, nor seemed to provide a path that could result in anything like the literature I admire."
2,21 gun salute!,"This is one of the best Voyager books I have ever read! (Beware:Spoilers included) Ok, we start with the crew getting home and meeting their familys and its really kinda touching. Tom makes up wiht his dad, B'elanna meets hers, Seven finds her aunt and so forth. (for J/Cers, the C/7 ... kinda goes down a proverbial well!:)] Cool stuff happens, then people start to just erupt with Borg implants at random. Janeway and co are blamed and put in prison. Also, the Doc is charged with starting a revolt among the holograms."
2,GREAT BUY!,"I bought this on spur of the moment, its been working great! im completely satisfiedw with my purchase. will probably buy from seller again. good and prompt delivery."
1,re-manufactured,"I knew I was buying re-furbished machine, But it had some issues that should have been addressed. The legs are uneven, so it does not sit flat on the counter and kneading causes it to rock. Some of the buttons stick and it came somewhat dirty. It is working well however and so the trade off is a few bucks for a few quirks."
2,...its well worth it.,"The quality of the bag is very good. I'm still trying to find out what each filter lense is about. And the batteries are fin but only 1200mAh, i.e. they don't pack as much electricty as Kodak's 1450mAh or others with 1600mAh. Still, I'm happy."
1,Uneven collection,"I hate to cast a shadow on a worthy (fund-raising) release but this was a terribly disappointing purchase. Some of the tracks were rather clumsy (Yanni) or derivative (2002's Enya rip-off) and there didn't seem to be any match between the tracks and the avowed conception for the album. The mix levels varied so much that I had to keep playing with my volume control. Licensed Massage Therapists beware!Why is Kenny G's ""Dying Young"" theme on this album? Music-lovers beware.The 2 short Vangelis tracks (from the soundtrack of 1492:Conquest of Paradise) are harmonically more interesting than the companion tracks. However the track ""Eternity"" did not seem to fit a Cousteau/Aquatic theme. It would have been more fitting to use some of his music from the album ""Oceanic"" (heck - buy that album and send a few bucks to the Earthsea Institute) or to publish some of the unreleased music Vangelis created for early Cousteau documentaries."
1,"If there was a zero, I'd pick it!!!","I absolutely love hiphop! I've been listening to it all my life. In my lifetime, I've purchased hundreds of albums. This album, by far, is the absolute worst ""hip hop"" album, if you dare to call it that, that I have ever heard!!! I've owned it for about two, or three months now, and barely listened to it less than 2 times. In fact, as soon as I finish writing this, I'm going to crack the cd in two, and throw it in the garbage! It's actually in my pocket right now ready to go! I hated it! It was seriously painful to listen to it more than one time. I absolutely hated it!!! Do NOT buy this album, you'll be happy you did'nt. It includes the absolute weakest rhymes, and beats EVER!!!!! Whomever it was that wrote this album, seriously needs to get a life, far apart from hip hop that is! Give me a break, Dungeons and Dragons!!! God! It makes me want to run full speed into a brick wall!!!"
2,Fits Perfectly,For the quality and fit of this cover the price is a bargain. It fits very snugly and the rubberized material improves the grip. I found the razr v3 to be akward or slippery at times and this cover takes care of that problem. I would recommend this product highly.
2,Code for Modem operations,"The Visual Basic Programmer's Guide to Serial Communications provides the help that a novice programmer needs to get up and running for writing the necessary code to send and receive data via modem communications. While developing a good application for this communication is complex and challenging, Richard Grier does provide the Basic Guide with easy to follow examples for Modem connection (handshake) and initial data transfer. Development of the send/receive protocol is touched upon in this Basic Guide but will require considerable effort on the programmer's part to get it right. All in all, this Basic Guide is a very good place to start and is the best instruction I've discovered to-date."
1,Not what I expected.,"I order two of these bokkens because I saw it has pretty high review.I received two of different weight and density. After playing 5 minutes with my 7 year old son,the lighter one got all dented. I have to say that my 7 year old son doesn't hit that hard.In addition, one of the rubber to hold the hand guard came missing. I agree with one of the other comment that the blade is rather thick."
1,Bad product with no good waste of money,"Centon DataStick Pro 16 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive DSP16GB-009 this type of device is useless also claims a free operating system error and does not work a waste of money and time, I'm from Venezuela's best to buy good brands and I do not recommend this product and return it or how bad they sell bad products quality.very very bad product."
2,It's about choices,Joyful Noise is a good movie and for some light entertainment it's a good choice. I'm glad movies like this are available for us and if we support them then more will be made and the quality/storyline will improve.
2,The New Fusion of Jazz & Gospel,"Kim Burrell brings to us a new ReFusion of jazz, blues, a little hip hop and go-go all into the mainstream of gospel music much in the relative vein of Maestro Thomas Whitfield. Annointed yes, but also a coffee fresh blend that will keep you uplifted, upbeat and re-evaluating your relationship with God. Trust me she's not the same old apples. A word for the gospel veterans: Doobie Powell, son of the phenominal musician Hubert Powell, is doing keyboards as well as Steven Ford who has done considerable work for world reknown Gospel Artist Richard Smallwood."
1,Makes my hair feel like straw,"I've only bought this in stores, not on amazon & I don't care for it at all. I prefer the straightening gel which of course is nowhere to be found in stores now."
1,Disgraceful !!,"What a complete disgrace. To publish a ""picture book"" of beautiful guitars in a 6"" x 8"" format size.THIS IS NOT A NOVEL ....THIS IS A PICTURE BOOK !!The book is too small to see the pictures, let alone appreciate details in the guitars.Under magnifying glass and a bright lamp ...I'M NOT KIDDING...there is some redemption.Complete and utter dissappointment. I feel bamboozelled !"
1,Sent two extra orders,This order was not made by me or Amazon but I notified them within 10 minutes after receiving conformation but they still sent 2 orders I did not make!
1,Terrible..Terrible...Terrible,Absolutley the worse movie in terms of both acting and storytelling I have ever had seen. A ridiculous representation that doesn't warrant documenting all the problem areas. Please....save your money.
2,A Puccini Gem,"As with the Pappano version, one exhausts superlative on these two Rondines. The principals are marvelous, the sound is superb, although the Pappano version possibly profits from newer technology in the years between them, with the orchestral and vocal voices more distinct and separable in the Pappano. Gheorghiu and Alagna are just a bit more intimate and fresh, where Te Kanawa and Domingo more polished, but there is no way to choose between these two invaluable sets. A solid investment for anyones opera library."
1,13 year old boy.............. Kids horror MOVIE?,I think that this movie had a good cast their acting was not all that bad. The 13 year old boy was belived to posses a power that would end the curse of the skin walkers. Some wanted to be cured and willingly died protecting the boy and some wanted the curse to continue. What turned out to be his power was not really all that and this movie could have been much better. I would have said that this movie was made as a horror movie for kids except for a scene of sexuality. Rent this movie if you feel you need to find out for your self but don't buy it unless if you are 13 years old or are buying it for one.
2,Supreme artistry!,"Full credit to Cembal D'amour for bringing to light this almost forgotten great master of the piano, Mindru Katz. Unlike his famous compatriots, such as the legendary Dinu Lipatti, Clara Haskil or Radu Lupu, Katz failed to do full justice to his immense talent. This CD of Bach selections presents Mr. Katz with the perfect opportunity to amaze us with his flawless technique and surpassing poetry. Let us hope that this issue, along with another Cembal D'amour release, his magnificent Khachaturian Piano Concerto, would help revive interest in this great artist and credit his talent with the fame and wider recognition he fully deserves."
1,Nice while it lasted...,"Bought two of these in 2010. They do heat a room nicely. I don't use them much (I live in San Francisco), but one developed fan problems after a year and would only work intermittently. It finally gave up the ghost completely in November 2012. Cheaply made plastic parts probably couldn't handle the heat. I'm waiting for the second one to conk out, then I'll try a different brand."
1,"TWO SIDED DISC, REALLY?",In order to watch this you have to flip the disc mid way. I took the wrapper off and saw that on the insert. SO I sent it back
2,Entertaining Fairy Tale,"This is the story of how a farmer (and his dog) defend their farm from ogres and dragons and the like, which propels them reluctantly to fame and riches. Filled with irony, humor, and good morals, (not to mention fairy-tale action) it is a story that shows Tolkien's lighter side.Farmer Giles of Ham is a fairy tale like story. It is rather short, and LOTR fans will find it lacking a lot of the depth Tolkien usually has. I would recommend it to a younger audience to get kids interested in his greater works. Still, it is pretty entertaining."
2,Letters from Camp Review,I think that this book was very well written and illustrated. The characters were very interesting to read about. My favorite was Barby Q.. I loved the way the kids found a way to solve the mystery and how in the end they made their own camp. It was a kind of camp that I would like to stay at for the Summer. Please keep writing.
2,A True Woman's Bible,"When I ordered this Bible I must admit that the picture of the cover was the first thing that attracted me to it. At the time I was looking for another Woman's Bible. I stumbled upon this one by accident. While compairing the two Bibles I opted for this one and I am so glad I did. It truly is a Woman's Bible. The Bible I had been using was okay, but I wanted one that was a little more femine.This Bible is femine while not being to over the top. It has some great quotes in it from some great women. It also has certain Bible verses picked out that would be easy to memorize (if you are in to that). I'm following the daily devotionals and loving it. There are 3 questions with each devotional that they give you to think about. I've been keeping a journal and writing the questions/answers down.All in all a great Bible!"
2,memory upgrade,"Just what I needed. The memory chips arrived safely and in a timely manner, and the improved performance of my older notebook computer was apparent and gratifying... thank you."
1,I can't believe I'm disappointed,"I've been a fan (a true fanatic) of Simon's work since the mid-sixties, to the point where I don't even pretend to be objective about him. I even loved One Trick Pony and The Capeman. But I just could not get into this CD at all. And it's not like I have to have All Graceland, All The Time -- my two favorite Simon albums are ""Paul Simon"" and ""Hearts and Bones."" I figured I'd eat this thing up. But I find the lyrics shockingly banal and the music really forgettable. And yes, I have listened to it numerous times. If I'm going to give anyone the benefit of the doubt, it's Simon. But there's no doubt anymore -- I just moved to a place with its own storage locker, and ""You're the One"" went in there along with all the other CDs I know I won't be playing anytime soon. (If and when Springsteen ever disappoints me this way, I'm going to be one depressed music fan.)"
2,THAT VOICE!,"ALlison Krauss has the most amazing voice! I bought this CD for the song ""When God Dips His Pen of Love in My Heart"". Good old Southern Country Gospel! Everytime I play it in my car, at home or at work, we ""have church""! :)"
1,Poison Gas Inside - wish there were negative stars,"Purchased this with the intention of keeping our cat from urinating in a certain area of the house (and possibly use to keep out of the baby's crib). I thought that the can contained plain old compressed air. Unfortunately, it is not compressed air but refrigerant (like what is used in automobile air conditioning systems). I would not deem this safe to use around pets or put in the crib.Tried to return the product but it is considered HAZARDOUS materials. Don't purchase this poison for your house, it isn't worth the risk to the health of your pets or family members."
1,doesn't last forever,I have had this wrist watch for less than 2 years and it stopped working. I contacted the vendor and received no response. I am both disappointed in the vendor and the product. I expect more from a Seiko.......or is it.
1,Big but underpowered,It was mismanufactured and sat out of square on the sled. Then the degree angle levers were misaligned;you could not tighten them as they struck the sled. I found that the big hole in the sled makes it hard to use when starting cutting a beam. The power is not alot different than my 7 1/4 Bosch circulat saw. You have to be really careful to pry away the cut off as the saw binds and stops.The guard lever needs to be longer as NORMAL fingers cant hold it up when starting the cut.I did not find it all that heavy.
1,Disappointing for Bob Morris,"My first Bob Morris book was Baja Florida. It took about 60% to get to the really exciting part but I thoroughly enjoyed the thrill and excitment. This book seemed to drag on and on with tedious detail of a political fight in Jamaica. In the end Monk DeVane who was supposed to be dead shows up for about 10 minutes only to die again in an explosion and then the book ends. This Morris novel was painful to get through only to have a mediocre ending. Morris is a favorite of mine, but this one was a big yawn for me."
1,Never Again,Submitted federal and state income tax three (3) times and each time it was rejected due to LAST YEAR's AVERAGE GROSS INCOME (AGI) WAS NOT WHAT THE IRS HAD ON FILE.Filing 2002 Taxes - NOT - 2001 Taxes. Can't get back in to refile without being charged AGAIN.
2,Some Hits 2002,"I had Now 9. I really liked it. So,I bought Now 10. I liked it too.

1,"The ""Bogus"" Secret",This book is a load of bull. It says over and over you can have whatever you want if you say it to yourself over and over. A phoney crap load and a 1/2.
1,No Way,"This was without a doubt the worst movie ever made. If they could of only made it better, meaning like REALLY BETTER, maybe I would consider it. Other than that, TERRIBLE!!!!"
2,dense nuts!,"Dense in content, but melts in full sun and extreme heat. birds still love it either way. found chickadees and many songbirds who love the nuts."
2,I'll never eat an undercooked burger again.,"Fast Food Nation describes all the horrors of the fast food industry, from the conditions in the slaughterhouses to the high quantities of bacteria in the meat. Schlosser's analysis is both sound and riddled with detail that would perhaps be best not to know. Nevertheless, it has opened the eyes of countless readers and convinced them to never eat in a fast food ""restaurant"" again."
1,"If it is not broke, don't fix it!!!!","My daughter and I were so disappointed with the ""new look"" of Madeline. She is a big fan of Madeline and she wanted to know if we could return it for an ""old one."" The new one doesn't have that sweet quality of the original madeline. I hope Toys R Us will continue to stock the original Madeline. Remember the ""new Coke"". Classic Coke and Classic Madeline are here to stay."
1,Beware! Apple Warranty Service is nonexistent.,"Bought IPOD 15GB for my daughter. After 2 months the LCD cracked without any accidental injury to the unit. Apple refuses to provide service under warranty claiming the damage could not possibly be due to defect. They will repair it for $250 which coincidentally is the price of a new unit. Based on this ""superior"" customer support, I would advise against buying any Apple product."
1,Agreed - they fail often,"I have to agree with the other reviews. My kitchen was installed with these hinges and I've been replacing them quite often. I'd estimate I have about 80 of them and so far in the past 4 years since I bought my house, I've replaced about 25% of them (and here I am shopping for more replacements).My advice... if you have these, buy them in bulk and have a few extra at all times because they will all eventually break and make that ""snap"" noise on open/close.Is it worth re-drilling all your cabinet doors and buying something more sturdy? I don't plan to. The replacement cost and effort is still pretty low. The faceplates seem to hold up well so you're only replacing the odd hinge every few years at $2 bucks a pop. And when they're not broken, they do indeed work rather well. Replacing them is easy enough, fortunately."
2,This is the bgame of all time,you'll should like to play this game im a hillbilly and love to play it.thank you
2,Pa Construction,We drilled and set pins in concrete and it was all the puller could do to get them out. We even had two guys pushing down on the bar. I thought it was going to break. It never did yet. Good product so far.
2,Great Space Saver!,"I first saw this item on America's Test Kitchen and knew I had to have it. I don't have a ton of counter space and this is perfect when I'm baking trays of cookies, granola, pretzels, you name it! It is very sturdy, too. I used to have my baking sheets crowded on any open surface, but this puts them all in one place and doesn't use up any more room than one baking sheet would take up. It stores so well that even in my filled-up kitchen cupboards, I was able to find room for this rack. A definite must for anyone who bakes a lot and wants to free up some counter space!"
2,Offensive but enjoyable and funny,"The acting debut of Meth and Red together and it remains to be funny. This movie is very funny, offensive and has a funny cast. If you liked Friday or Don't be a menace, ou'll love this."
2,Great but could be better,"This is the thing,Limp Bizkit are experimenting.Fred Durst said that this album was simply showing more of himself on this album...I understand. It's just that they should experiment with better things. Alternative music has been done before and better,I just turned sixteen and can tell you that Nirvana was the greatest alternative band.This album isn't bad it's just that it's trying to hard.Limp went from rap/metal to alt/rap with metal.""Trust?"" is actually my favorite Limp song and this album has some good tracks on it too.Wes Borland rules."
1,Don't judge a book by its cover,"This book is basically a poor product that has been successfully sold. It is terrible. It is a lie! On the back of my book it says ""Jazz up your site with 20 exclusive, ready-to-use professional CGI scripts and subroutines--no programming required!"" It is sold as if it will satisfy the needs of people who do not understand Perl, while it is almost impossible for it to satisfy anyone, as it is. Hours and hours of troubleshooting and trying to figure out what is wrong is part of what you will get from this book. If you survive through that part of it, you will probably learn that it would be easier for you to learn Perl enough to do things in your own way. Buy another book. Find another way!"
1,dissapointment,"I don't think this product is for everyone. yes it does everything it's suppose to do, but if you're an American, working and living in a typical American city and office, bringing a HUGE food thermos to work is really a hassle and not very encouraged by colleagues. it's just weird. after reading the many rave reviews and the thought of saving money was very luring, i decided to buy one for myself. after a few times, it's just not worth the hassle. there's alot of washing to do when you're done eating. and when you're eating, either you lay out all the dishes or you eat them one at a time because you're too embarrassed. anyway, maybe if i work in an asian office this could be lunch time fun."
2,A Lab owners life,"I have 4 lab mixes and this book is my life with them to a T. I love them all but they all have had moments of chewing walls, floors or all the chirtmas presents. Really a touching wonderful book. I would recomend it to everyone."
2,great sandwiches,"I never had a panini before and didn't know what to expect...boy are they good. I like the crispness of the outside of the sandwich and it does heat the filling up nicely without burning the outside. I only wish that I would have paid more attention to the dimensions. Actually, I thought the cooking plate would be bigger. Somewhat of a disappointment. Otherwise, it is easy to clean and does make good sandwiches."
2,Life...transforming!,"I've heard the term ""transformation"" (whether instantaneous or not) many times in my career. After reading ""WOYDW"" this is the first time in my life where I actually ""get it"". This amazingly inspiring little book did more for me that all the years of work I had done in the past to try and ""fix"" myself. Who would have thought how powerful being in the moment could be? I have already bought this book three times as a gift for friends. And what a gift it is! As a musician and music teacher, I find this book to be essential reading material. Thank you Ariel and Shya Kane!"
2,Awesome Writer,"Beverly Jenkins is an awesome writer. Her characters are loveable, funny and a pleasure to get to know. My kindle LIBRARY is filled with most of her books. I recommend her highly"
1,"Nowhere near the greatness of Romero,s classics.","I was interested in seeing this film after reading numerous reveiws about it on the internet.Some going as far as saying it was the best Zombie film of all time.So i rented it expecting alot.To say i was disappointed would be an understatement.Where to start,first the dubbing,it was horrible and really bought the film down.Second it had to many spots in the movie where nothing happened and where flat out boring.This bothered me alot.It has good points,the zombie makeup are very good,better then dawn of the dead,but a nocth below day of the dead.Thats about all the good points,it just wasnt scary,it didnt give me that terryfing feeling that Dawn or Day gave me.If you already have seen the Romero classics then give this one a try.Just dont expect much."
1,Where is the English dub?,"Make an English dub of this and I will buy it. I refuse to support any anime company that releases series that are Japanese with English subtitles only. This is stupid because this is the United States and we speak English here. The whole purpose of watching anime is the beautiful animation. Why would I wish to spend my time reading subtitles and missing out on the gorgeous artwork? Answer: I wouldn't.Anime companies should wise up and release English dubbed versions. You need to cater to your audience, not the other way around. Learn or never sell your products. What a disappointment to be interested in a series, only to find no dub and realize you will never purchase an incomplete product."
1,pkm,I was disappointed to see the ingredients as ammonium alum while thenatural body deo are potassium alum. I dont know why they are making foolbut its a serious matter because there are still no studies to prove thatthis synthesized salt is safe to use.
1,Not for us,"This movie is mostly dark, sad and borrowed. It's like Annie meets Santa Paws but where Santa Paws endears himself to a bunch of little girls, looses his power crystal and then becomes a stuffed animal that almost gets burned up in the trash. My 5 year old ran away from the TV and put her face in the wall while my 7 year old cried her eyes out in hysterics. Yes, the cliche ""greedy, thinking only of money"" character somehow sees the true meaning of Christmas. However, that story has been told in much lighter and more effective ways than here. And the message was lost on my kids who couldn't see past the terrifying plot points Disney felt they needed in order to reach a larger audience? Such a shame. If you haven't seen the first Santa Buddies movie, get that one. MUCH better, nice story, nice message, fewer tears. I hate that I spent the money on this. Worse, I hate that my kids will have bad dreams tonight."
2,dee-lish!,excellent cd! i saw her live with counting crows and really just fell in love with her music. buy one for yourself and a couple to give out to friends!
2,A very fine UPS,The Cyberpower UPS Is very smooth working and has some very nice features such as auto shutdown when you designate it to do so. The illuminated display shows a lot of useful information regarding the status of the UPS.I liked it so much I bought 2.
2,Five Stars,"A very good biography on five granddaughters of Queen Victoria who became queens. One of course the well known Alexandra of Russia, the others Maud of Norway, Sophie of Greece, Ena of Spain and Marie of Romania. Its the latter four queens that I bought this book. I knew very little about any of them. Each of them were very interesting in their own rights and events in their lives the author goes in great detail about each one of them from childhood to death. A wonderful read."
1,10 seeds sprouted grew about 1 inch the fell over dead,Followed all driections. Placed near window will good light. The soil is still moist so dont really know what the prob. is
2,Excellent book,I was studying wave propagation in anisotropic media from this book on my advisor's recommendation. I do not have a physics background but a mechanics background. This book was very helpful for me to understand the basic concept. I was surprised to see this book was out of print.
1,Buy it only if you need tinder for your fireplace,"""Check it out! I can use the cool military acronyms too!""That's what this book screamed at me when I read it. Slater's artistic license should be permanently revoked over this book: the US military is depicted as being so inept and stupid that they'd surrender to your average Pokemon armed with a Taco Bell Chalupa. The cover is misleading; there's no air combat at all. To top it off, the miltia freaks are depicted as more organized than they probably are in real life: gun control is not a big enough issue to foment a rebellion around, and the whole war would probably turn into an American version of the Indian Mutiny of 1857.The only frightening thing about this scenario is that it spawned sequels. Anybody who thinks Slater's better than Tom Clancy should know that Clancy at least researches his material."
1,Noble Effort Falls Short,"Deepa Mehta is a gifted director, and her previous work is highly noteworthy (""Earth"" being the most obvious example). But this was a disappointment on practically every level. The timing and delivery of the actors was awful, dialogue was canned, and production values fell short. Examining the cliches of both Bollywood and Hollywood and looking at South Asians in Toronto in a wry, self-reflexive way is a great idea, but the movie was so awful that none of that was achieved. Noble effort, but believe me, you don't want to waste two hours of your life watching this. Hopefully it was just an anomaly and her next one will make up for it (and she is genuinely talented, so there's no reason to think it won't)."
1,"So boring, I can't believe I finished this book...","This is one of those books that I started reading, was never gripped, but kept slogging through, figuring it must get better. It never did. The characters were lifeless, had no humanity, were not at all engaging. The story was bleak and not compelling. I read all these reviews that talk about her magificent writing--I never found it."
2,Great Product.,"I really like the expandable aspect of this pillow. You can make this product work for breatfeeding by using the cradle hold and resting your arm, not your child on the pillow. This helps keep your LO at the right height. It also works great for early tummy time and as a prop when Lo is figuring out how to sit up on their own. I have two covers that were given to me by friends, but you could easliy use this product without one.This product is high on my list of must-have's. I don't always use it, but it is very handy when I do."
2,Time to be Holy : Reflecting on daily Life,I felt a connection with the content of this book. It helped in sorting my thoughts and establishing a firm understanding of where I was and where I wished to be. Most importantly I felt it allowed me the room to feel okay about where I chose to be for now as long as I was honest with myself.
1,USED ONLY 3 TIMES AND IT BROKE,MY WIFE HAD ONE OF THE OLDER TYPES AND LOVED IT.IT WAS TIME FOR A NEW ONE.THE NEW ONE WAS USED THREE TIMES AND THEN IT BROKE.
1,Sabatier ChefStar Knife Block Just Doesn't Cut It!,"The price seemed too good to be true...and it was... The knife block looks cheap and there is an empty slot for you to fill in ""with your own knife;"" it just looks like oneof the knives is missing. Go to a high-end department store and buy the Farberware KnifeBlock set for same price and you'll be just as happy."
2,Perfect for medium sized Container Lunches.,"This is perfect for container lunches. We use those screw-top Ziploc containers and it holds about 4 of the small ones perfectly. or 2 large ones. I also use one of the small containers for my ice pack. I fill it 3/4 full of water and freeze. It was a little narrower than anticipated so it will not accommodate large square (cube) shaped containers very well. Those glad containers that lunch-meat comes in fit perfect also. Ours shipped to us in good shape. It came to us un-zipped with the top sides folded down and nicely flattened for shipping. It sprang back to shape after a few uses. Don't be to worried about the flat as a pancake reference in one of the other reviews. It may have been a fluke and theirs was damaged and should have been returned.Regardless, If you are looking for something in-between the ""sack"" style and the cooler this is what you want. and it's only 10 bucks!"
1,2Wire modems are junk,"I am now on my second 2Wire modem and, inevitably it seems, they give out within one year. Keep losing signal, wireless or hard-wired! Will never buy 2Wire again!!"
2,For Readers Who Just Wanna' Have Fun,"Adult readers, please shut off your reality and turn on your imagination; please read Roald Dahl's THE WITCHES. It's written for 7-12 year olds, but I guarantee you'll also have fun with it.My favorite lines pinched my nostrils together when I read them. ""I ... ran into The Grand High Witch's bedroom. There was the same musty smell about the place that I had noticed in the Ballroom [a witches' meeting]. It was the stench of witches. It reminded me of the smell inside the men's public lavatory at our local railway-station.""Pee-ew! That's some stench!"
1,What have they tried to the original movie Cinderella??,"HiI wanted to add my two cents, here. I saw this movie when it first came on tv in the mid 90's. I don't remember it that well, but remember being stunned and horrified of such a multi-cultural cast. I agree with the reviewer who pointed out how odd it was and awkward it would have been to try to explain to your kids why the king is asian and his parents are both different races. I hadn't thought about that. And Brandy as Cinderella?? Please. I did like some of Whitney's singing, but competely disagreed with all the different races in the movie.. and a BLACK step-sister?? Geez. And no, i am not racist. I just thought it was very odd and very wrong to have different races making up families in the movie. TOO PC for me. YOu just can't improve on the original classic."
2,Wanted a Sinkmaster--Settled for a Waste King,"My Sinkmaster Disposal bought many years ago requires a 3-inch diameter splash guard which is no longer available, howerer Waste King apparently replaced Sinkmaster but the splash guard is slightly bigger than 3 inches and sits a little more snug in the sink throat. It works really good at preventing splash back when operating the disposal but water or other liquids drain much slower when the disposal is not in use. You cant buy the splash guard separately without the stopper."
1,Not an Energizer!,"Did not get an ""Energizer"" battery! Received a ""Jensen"" battery (made by Audiovox). Hope it lasts. Will not try to return given other (one star) reviewer's comments."
1,Not widescreen,"This DVD, along with the other Disney releases this month, (Moon Spinners, Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again, Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, etc.) is only being released in fullscreen, *not* anamorphic widescreen..."
1,disappointed,"My family received this game as a gift. The 12 year old in our family had a hard time answering the questions, even though we consider ourselves to be a well-read family. We had to specifically look for cards about Children's Books for her. While it says that 2 or more can play the game, it would be impossible given the rules of the game for 2 people to play. Much of the game depends on the first person to identify the book yet passing the clues to the ""person on the left"" creates logistical difficulties. We will have to greatly modify the rules in order to play this game again, or we may just save it for the next garage sale."
2,A nice companion to the text,This workbook contains exercises that really help to deepen your understanding of the concepts covered in the text. It allows you to personalize what you've read and consider how you would operate as a therapist within the different types of counseling.
2,Nice semple,really my son like it i had 9 books and its very good for his age he is 4Y old.its good quality and cheap.
2,A very cool game,"Crash Bandicoot is the best. If you are patient and like running around crashing boxes open, jumping over holes in the ground, running under jungle rollers, and doing away with skunks, this is the game for you! There is only one problem that I found. You can crash certain boxes open to get a free life, but when you run out of them, you have to do the previous level over, too. But don't worry. I am an impatient person sometimes, and I get along fine. I just bought this game, believe it or not, and it's the coolest."
2,Sad But Encouraging,"Etty Hillesum's voice was not stilled by the fanatics and barbarians of Nazi Germany. Her voice speaks on to succeeding generations in this book, albeit in the saddest possible context of senseless hatred and unspeakable atrocities. This book can rightly take its place alongside Anne Frank's diary as a testament to our capacity for good in the face of soul-grinding degradation and calculated injustice."
1,Doesn't work and can't get anyone on the phone,"Christmas present for daughter. She's heartbroken. The CD compartment won't open. Took 5 minutes to navigate throught the warranty phone system, only to be told by a recording to leave a message. Life is too short to deal with these people."
1,"Uhhh, where did this DVD come from?","The photos on the cover are of a little girl Hayley Mills and an old man John Hurt. In the movie they are roughly the same age: supposed to be college age.This edition of the movie is recorded from TV or someone's video tape. It's a homemade job. Guess that's why it's only $5.The movie is reminiscent of Never Cry Wolf and other movies of one man alone in the wilderness. Hayley Mills is in about 1/3 of the movie but most of the time she and John Hurt are apart (he's off bonding with the penguins).It's a sort of strange movie, but kind of fun to see. It was interesting to see that John Hurt really was young once upon a time. The time he spent with the penguins was pretty interesting, but don't get the idea that this is a romance. It's mostly a nature film. Maybe worth the $5, maybe not."
2,Good for indoor exercise!,"I bought this rug for my girls to get a little exercise while indoors during the winter months. It comes all rolled up, but then flattens out nicely! No rolled edges to trip on! And this means it can easily be stored in the closet or under the bed when not in use, if needed. It does have a non-skid backing, but still slides around just a bit on carpet, but that's to be expected as the girls jump on it.I know this rug is a little pricier than the foam-block kind, but to me, the flat rug is worth it. I didn't want to risk any twisted ankles if someone jumped too close to the edge on one foot!"
1,Pretty watch but made like junk,"I bought this good looking Pro Diver as a present for my son in law who never owned an automatic watch Two months later, the second hand fell off. I complained to Invicta. They told me to send it in for repair. The shipping and handling was almost $30 and that did not include the postage it cost me to get the watch to them. They kept the watch for 3 months, claiming that it had to be sent to Switzerland for repair. Nonsense, the watch has a Japanese movement and it would be cheaper to replace the watch then to ship it to Europe. When I got the watch back, my son in law had it for 3 more weeks and the bezel fell off. I had it repaired at a local shop for 10 bucks. This watch cost me more for shipping and repair then I paid for it in the first place. Furthermore, Invicta's customer relations and repair facilities stink."
1,Do not buy,This horn is the biggest piece of krap next to a pile of dog mess that I have ever seen in my life. The thing is un believably low toned you can't hardly hear it. Let alone use it to motivate a jerk texting on his phone. I spent 180 dollars on this from my local speed shop. Who's the joke on now. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!
1,SKIP THIS ONE UNLESS YOU'RE OBSESSIVE!!,"Here we have yet ANOTHER in the long line of Joni Mitchellcompilation CD's. First there was ""Hits"", then ""Misses"",then ""Travelogue"" where she reinterpreted (with a syrupyorchestra to enhance what's left of her voice) her catalog,then ""Dreamland"", then ""The Beginning of Survival"", and now""Songs Of A Prairie Girl"". I find it interesting that anartist who has criticized corporate greed on many occasionsfeels the need to milk her fans for yet another $15 bucks apop. Yes, the songs are strung together to present them ina different context, but so what? Anyone can do that themselves.Joni, if you're serious about retiring, then RETIRE. If youwant to release a legit boxed set with rarities, live cuts,etc. I'm all for it. But enough of these stale repackagingsof your songs! You're using up a lot of your fans' goodwill."
1,This Seat IS NOT COMPATIBLE with the Body Rider Fan Bike.,"Based on the recommendation of Amazon, I bought this seat to ""upgrade"" the basic seat of the Body Rider Fan Bike - stationary exercise bike. This seat is likely great for a traditional bike but it simply is not compatible with this exercise bike. I find it completely irresponsible of Amazon to make a recommendation that consumers buy them together."
1,Great concept but doesn't live up to expectations,"I love the concept and functionality of this device and it works great if it's connected to an external power supply, but the battery is severely under-sized. The player will only run for about 3 hours on battery and then just randomly stop if there is too much disk activity. I have tried to contact Archos numerous times by phone and email and have received no response. There tech support is non-existent. Until the battery issue is resolved, I recommend not buying this product."
2,Great Back Pack,"This back pack was everything I wanted. The straps seem stout enough to handle all the weight (Most important to me). The space in the pack is good, fit my 15"" Laptop with ease. The Rollers are made like the roller blade wheels and although I don't use it much I have and it works good."
1,Did Not Work As I Had Hoped.,"I bought this tool with hopes that I would be able to successfully use it on at least one of my dogs. They are complete opposite sizes, one small and one very large. Both have a lot of dental tartar and build up. They are well behaved and sit very still for me to to things like this to them so that is not an issue.The first thing that I noticed when I removed it from the packaging was how sharp each end was. If your hand slips at all, this could potentially be very dangerous in your dog's mouth. Still, I carefully tried it on each of my canines but it made no difference. It was not able to chip off any of the plaque or remove any tartar and I was afraid to put too much force into it as I didn't want to damage their gums in the process.Personally, I would not recommend this tool to anyone else."
2,I've been hunting for this stuff forever!,"I don't know why the big companies stopped making cake eyeliner. Could it be because it's so economical to use? I used every bit of cake eyeliner I had down to the nubs -- and believe me that took a long time.People in the shops have told me that I'm not the only customer trying to find it! And now that I've read what others are saying on Amazon, I know that this is a product in demand.bePROFESSIONAL mekeup cake eyeliner is an excellent product, goes on nicely and lasts. It definitely lasts longer for me than pencil liner and has a much nicer look.If you've never used cake eyeliner before, this is a super one to try. You'll probably never go back to pencil again."
1,"Horrible, awefull, terrible, pathetic","What else is there to say? This albumn proves that Metallica should change their name, they have nothing in common with the Metallica of old."
2,Exactly what it should be,It was purchased as a gift request for a lover of Cara Mia. No complaints. Was exactly as expected. A great gift.
2,"Bright Colors, Safe Playground",My bird LOVES the colors of this thing. It is perhaps its best aspect. Easy to keep clean and super safe with no sharp parts.
1,Just my thoughts,Length:: 4:47 MinsMust See. Think its metal ThinkAgain. Much watch. And a 16 Year old's Thought. have been airsofting for 3 years..
1,Poor sound quality,Very poor sound quality. I have a cheap drugstore non-USB microphone that sounds much better. Dissatisfied with product and have returned for refund.
1,Comprehensive but dated cruising guide,"An impressive tome at 600 pages, though at 6+ years since publishing, it is dated for a cruising guide. The Amazon.com headline reviews are misleading with statements of ""brand new"" and ""latest"". I'll keep it (a gift) as an armchair planning guide, but will seek more current information before cruising the Keys. The content is comprehensive, but the format is not the best for use on-board . The newsprint quality paper is easily torn and not water resistant. Better cruising guides are of 8 1/2""x11"" coated stock, and spiral bound for easier insertion of updates."
1,a come on,"I bought this because it says starring Tony Sirico,Tony is more of acameo ,the main guy in this I remember in a oldPacific Blue episode.Kind of funny but just average entertainment"
1,Not where it,"Not funny at all, I remeber seeing this movie I spliit a side it has changed. I murphy bed is cute but worth it."
2,Love this CD,"If you loved the music of the 1950s, this will be a great addition to your collection. The Fontane Sisters had some great hits. Each time I play this, it takes me back to my childhood."
1,Does not work.,"This trouser press does not work. It does not heat up hot enough to get the wrinkles out of slacks especially those with rayon or polyester material which requires a higher heat setting. Also since only one side is heated, the slacks will have an uneven press on the two pant legs. I have found that if the slacks are not positioned right, you will end up with double creases on the pants which will require ironning to get out."
2,Great Show!,"I loved this show! As a Labor and Delivery Nurse i felt the storylines authentic, and fascinating to see post-war London."
2,New journalism's next brilliant superstar!,"Mike Sager is Writer-at-Large for Esquire Magazine, and here offers a major collection of magazine articles and profiles that equal the best of the best work by Hunter Thompson, Joan Didion and Tom Wolfe. Rock stars, space cults, high-profile frauds, slimy politicians and doomed porn actors among others come under Sager's discerning inspection; he details some of the more spectacular failures of recent times with a narrative flow and punch that equals the best fiction. This might well be the work that Nathaniel West might have done if he wrote nonfiction. A terrific read"
1,Not as good as everyone thinks....,"When everyone says mag lights are ""top of the line"" they are being incredibly naive! Try looking into some real flashlights like Surefire, Fenix, and Huntlight! Mag lights even measure in candlepower, which grossly exaggerates brightness too. You turn them on and they're bright, but in 10 minutes it'll get dimmer. I own a flashlight by Fenix which is easily 5 times as bright as this and will fit in the palm of my hand! Before you buy this light, consider the p1dCE by Fenix, or the G2 from Surefire. Thank you!"
1,Product should be described as very small,"product came in good package and was on time as expected. i was disappointed at first for the VeRY small size. the picture of this product should not be close up, but rather, there must be a tool, a hammer at the side or anything to have a good view how big it is. only Nails can fit this and very small tools. And this is in fact what i did to make a good use of it. anyway if you are looking for storage of nails, or sort of, this is for you. but otherwise, avoid."
1,can't believe this is a Bob's Red Mill product,"Normally I love the Bob's Red Mill products, but I made this one, had a couple slices from it and ended up throwing it out. It came out hard and barely tasted like cinnamon raisin. I would recommend a bunch of their other products (especially the pizza mix) but I would advice against buying the cinnamon raisin bread mix."
2,Best Study Guide,"Having been out of college for more than a decade, I was nervous about the prospect of taking this exam. My performance on a sample test was dismal, and would have been a failure if it were the actual test. I purchased the guide, and studied it from cover to cover. The book provides a great overview of the concepts likely to be on the test. The performance assessments help identify your weak areas. There are even 3 FULL-LENGTH practice tests at the end.I took the test and got great scores! I was so impressed with this book, I bought the Praxis 2 study guide from the same publisher."
2,Don't miss this one!,"I've been meaning to buy some more King Oliver to complement the few Gennett selections I've got on LP, but I had always put it off. Now that I've bought this set, I wonder, what took me so long!? These later sides by King Oliver are much underrated. Of course, they're not the classic 1923 sides with Louis Armstrong, but they are still quite a treat! The jazz is hot, and it's been wonderfully preserved. Unlike the tinny, crackly old acoustically-recorded Gennett recordings that he is famous for, these sides were recorded by Victor Records in 1929-1930, and are newly remastered here by John R. T. Davies. These records have rich, full-bodied clear sound with minimal surface noise, and of course, NO digital artifacts. The notes contain a complete discography of the selections with recording dates, personnel, and matrix numbers. If you're remotely interested in early jazz, get this set! You won't be disappointed."
1,"CRiCHTON SUFFERS FROM ""SORRY SEQUEL SYNDROME""","Michael Crichton has fallen prey to what I like to call ""Sorry Sequel Syndrome."" The Lost World is probably one of the worst written and boring novels I have read in my fifteen year life. By now even I know the do's and don'ts of a sequel.This book does not establish characters very well. If you were hoping to expand more on the character of Ian Malcolm in this book, read the first book again because you won't find the character you thought you knew here.The children in the story are pretty much there only to serve the classic adventure story cliche of the ""children in peril."" All throughout the book, we see traces of the children in the first book in this one.If you are looking for more Jurassic adventure, I advise you to look somewhere other than this book because you will only be dissapointed."
2,My favorite bowls,I love everything about these bowls! The handles make it easy to keep your hands clean while mixing ingredients. They go in the dishwasher and come out looking great! The bowls have shown no signs of rusting or staining unlike other bowls I've used.
1,POS,"I have had this little chopper for probably a year. A year far too long for what it's worth. The idea of a mini processor sounds very appealing, and if I had done some research before I went to a store and picked out the first one I saw, I would probably be writing a better review on another product. This processor is very weak. I can't even chop up nuts without HUGE chunks that don't get down into the blade. Making a dip? Forget about it. I get that this is a ""mini"" processor, but it should do what it was intended for, and it has not worked up to par. Go with a better model."
2,Best razor ever,"I've used this product for a month and I love it. Every morning I feel like I just came from the barbershop. If you guys are looking for razor blades, I would recommend the ""100 Shark Super Chrome Double Edge Safety Razor Blades"". They are awesome and this is where you will save money. They come 100 blades in a pack and they only cost about $18. I am so happy I bought this product."
1,No to Baby Wise,"I was given both Baby Wise books ten years ago from my mother-in-law when our first baby was born. Unfortunately, after reading the book our first year was difficult at times because the book philosophy didn't really work. Some of the information in the Babywise books is helpful, but the same information is available in other baby books on the market. Advice to moms from a mom of four little ones age 10 and under, go with your instincts and don't read so many baby books. Find friends, fellow parents you can trust, and ask them questions. Then make your own decision."
2,Hollywood HR8100,"We have used it twice and it works well, I bought a 1.25"" hitch for our Honda Odyssey 1999 to match the 1.25 receiver on this rack, it works well but does seem to bounce alot on the freeway. Other than that it worked great!"
1,pictures don't match words,"I have the entire baby einstein set for my daughter. she loves all of them, and even doesn't mind the language nursery. i, however, get frustrated that the visuals don't match the words. throughout the video when the narrater reads in the foreign language, the visual should pop up that match the words so that your child can learn by what's being said/heard. i also heartily agree with another reviewer that in some of the other baby einstein videos the narrator doesn't say the word correctly. leaf should sound like leaf, train should sound like train, not tree. it might sound cute, but it doesn't teach your child to annunciate correctly. i also can't understand the jokes that the child says because they have some odd reverberation effect going on with the microphone.even though i have these issues with the educational value of the series, i really think this series is great. they entertain my daughter and she likes them a lot. i have more problem with them than she does ;-)"
1,Twelth Night,Didn't like this movie at all. It became very cumbersome and boring. I enjoyed Shakespeare in Love so much better.
1,Totally Awful!!!,"This is the worst tribute album I have ever heard. All these great Maiden classics are butchered by these no talent ""Death Metal"" bands. If I could...I would give this tribute CD negative points. But I cant so I will give one star. (And it is not even worthy of that one star.) DO NOT buy this CD. I am trashing mine so I could never hear it again. Awful, awful CD."
1,have not received it,I have yet to receive the fan...... I have contacted the company and they seemto think I have. I will contact them yet again...I am very dissapointed with them.
2,More Mellow Tech-House Sounds from Saavas,"To those fans of straight-up four-to-the-floor tech-house music, this album won't disappoint. I found this CD to be more background music to wash dishes and wiggle your bum to than peak-hour booty-shaking dance music, but that's exactly what I was hoping it to be.SELECT does seem to have more of a funk to it than some of his earlier releases (Hi-Rise, or his Cooler release under his Sound Track alias), even hearkening back to early-to-mid 90s house sound with his use of a stuttering snare drum. Some tracks could easily find themselves on the Basic Channel/Chain Reaction label as well.Those of you who like your tech-house clean and mellow, ala Theorem or Maurizio, you will not be disappointed."
2,Great Deal!,"My husband loves his Callaway Polo shirts. I should have bought more. Great price, great quality, great look!"
2,Rudy gives it 2 thumbs up,"A smart,witty short story. Enjoyable on many levels. Jennifer Strand is excellent."
1,"My rating is one, because there is no zero rating.","This book is the most mindnumbing, hackneyed, putrescent piece of garbage I have ever read. I read this book with an expectation that Douglas Adams at his worst is merely wildly entertaining. This book has actual negative value. Not only was the time spent reading it wasted, but it retroactively wiped out all of my enjoyment of the other books in the series. I don't know why he wrote this book. He took a wonderful quirky set of stories and turned them into a moral that no one wants to here: ""The evil, stupid bureaucrats always win."" If you love the Hitchhiker's stories, avoid this book at all costs."
1,Save your money,"This movies is SO BAD, my true rating would be 5 black holes. It looks like it ought to be good--John Landis, the actors, but trust me, this would have to get way better to become merely BAD. Think three stooges, with PMS and guns. I got this because I am an Adrian Paul fan; I know some film work is better than none, but if you too are a fan, save your money and watch some old Highlander episodes. This actually hurt to watch."
2,Sharp little dictionary,"While limited in vocabulary, this is a handy item to carry to class or while travelling. It's smaller than a pocket sized dictionary and allows faster look-ups. After you have thumbed several characters of the word you want, it offers you a list to choose from. If you enter a spelling that it finds no word for, it lists similar words to choose from. The definitions provide part of speech, gender of nouns, and idiomatic uses. The Puzzles feature does not offer puzzles to solve, but is an aid in solving crossword puzzles (names of popes and presidents for example). As a student of Spanish, I had hoped for a way of looking up verb conjugations, but no such luck. The battery so far has lasted a month with frequent use."
1,Unbelievably boring,"This book is very clear, but it is quite boring. I have to read it for an astronomy class and the hundred dollars I spent on it has been wasted. All the concepts are very clearly explained through pictures, examples from real life and diagrams, but this textbook still sucks nonetheless. IF you know that you have to purchase this textbook for a class, pray the class isnt as dull as the reading"
2,Outstanding and a Remarkable Bargain,"Mozart's string quartets need no introduction. This collection is a compilation of recordings made by the famous Quartetto Italiano over a period of several years. The playing is excellent and it is very interesting to hear this range of quartets played by a single ensemble. At less than $14 per disk (Amazon list price plus shipping costs), this is an incredible bargain for so much rewarding music."
2,Another Excellent Series!,"Excellent series! I like all the Doctor's, yet, this doctor is very refreshing and quirky (as are they all in their own way). It always fascinates me how each new Doctor has his own personality that shines through. Yet, each is different in a new and inviting way."
1,Hand-Dancing and Mumbling lyrics,"Throughout the show Britney keeps doing the hand-dance if you know what I mean, the choreography is the same with everysong (the X-cross hand, the butterfly-ear hand, the inviting hand, etc.) I can barely hear what she is singing, all I can hear is the beat and the bass. So basically, every song performance is same same and it makes me fall asleep. She is gorgeous and fit and I have so much respect for her but this is too painful to watch. And did I even mention some of the remixes are terrible.I think Britney should have another choreographer and another Record Title, I mean whoever recorded and designed and released this DVD is so bad, the cover itself looks cheap and seems like they must have rushed to release it."
1,Orbit Hose Nozzle,Cheap plastic construction and uncomfortable handle. There are much better models out there such as the all metal Dramm 12705 Revolver 9-Pattern Pistol Hose Spray Nozzle with the comfort handle -- much better. It does provide a cheap back-up if the other nozzle breaks.
2,A Quirky and Kinky Merlin,"This is an outstanding retelling of the legend of Merlin, but it is not for everyone. It is quirky, kinky, and in places may offend people of faith. Stylistically, it is very imaginative; chapters vary wildly in length, and it may contribute to your store of stock phrases."
1,Unrealistic,"First time moms...this is a poor book to use for your child's potty training. I did not see the method as either practical nor was it realistic. I guess I should have known when I saw that it was written by PHD's instead of parents that have trained their own children in the real world. The expectation here is that you can get a 20 month old (on up)to maintain an attention span on potty training for several consecutive hours!!! Terribly unrealistic! Not to mention, I felt the mess was just not worth it. My daughter and I gave up on it in search of a method less militaristic and more flexible. This approach was much too stressful on both parties."
1,Not worth the trouble,"The Logitech Chillstream controller that I bought worked on the PS3 menus but stopped working once I loaded a PS2 game. It also seemed to lack a PS button so I could exit the game back to the menu.I returned it and got the Sony controller instead and that works beautifully on all my games, PS2 as well as PS3. Plus, the Sony controller is wireless."
1,Not worth it!,"Cute concept, bad design! This was one of my sons top picks for Christmas 2006. Were sorry we purchased it! The cans balance on top of a poorly made piece of plastic. If you breath wrong they are falling off! So, I got the job of holding them so my son could shoot them off. Yeah fun!!! If they had designed it a bit better it would be a great toy!"
1,*Yawn* i am bored,"Yes like my title I realized that this game is fun for the first two dayz, but after the second day i dunt seem to be able to keep myself awake. The constent need to manage 60 cities is more than a nuisance. The so called computer ""governer"" that is suposed to help with the job of managing cities, is absolutly stupid. This game is almost exactly like Civ 2 only with better graphics. This game is not worth the price, but for those that enjoy spending lots of time doing the same tasks over and over again, this might be your game. Yet i estimate this game can only keep gamers intersted for at most 1 week."
1,Waste of .99,"After reading Chasing Rainbows, I thought this would be a good read. Sorry to say NO! Save your money. Run, don't walk, in the opposite direction. Cherry on Top is a trick, not a treat."
2,new and fresh,"this c.d is awesome!i got it yesterday at lifeway in birmingham cause they was there sighning it.i talked to all of them and they ARE godly men!they are the best!bye this !cody tidwell,peace"

2,"Your Swept away to midevil times of Romance, war & passion!","I just LOVED this book, I would sit for hours and read, totally oblivious to the outside world. What an escape! Deveraux is one of my favorite Authors. I love the time period and shes done her homework to make it real!"
2,The Colonel,"My wife, from County Claire, absolutely loved them. By the way these are refered to as ""ha-pennies"" pronounced haypenny."
2,"Good product, good price.","We use this garlic during illness to boost our immune system, and I have taken it during pregnancy to help prevent infection. Garlic is a wonderful all-around natural remedy. We like this brand because it never makes your breath or body smell. It is easily digested and easy to swallow as well. Good price here on Amazon, especially with subscribe and save."
1,Beware of incompatibility problems,"Unable to install, the product was not compatible with my computer system."
1,"Absolutely terrible. Hate the band, Hate the tunes. JUNK",Stop wasting valuable space on radio air waves. I have never seen such junk.
1,Great while it lasted,"The pizza stone cracked on about its fourth use. I did not put stress on the stone. I have a Viking stove and the temperature was 500 degrees through pre-heating and baking of two pizzas. I left it in the oven the whole time and let it cool over night. Obviously, the price is great. The peel is fine and I will keep it as well as the cutter. Oh well... I wasn't looking forward to cleaning it anyway."
1,It stinks,"All of the spooky characters of the original Sherlock Holmes, but none of the charm. Dont get this movie for little ones!!!!"
2,Best headphones I've ever had,"I bought these after looking for headphone on cnet.com. They are magnificent, the bass is awesome, the highs are great, it feels like I'm at a concert. There are two problems that I've had with it. The magnets inside the headphones sometimes get stuck together and you need to tap on them otherwise it sounds really shaky. The other problem is that everyone can hear them, they are in no way, shape or form quiet."
2,A nice book for a newbie (2 years exp) in Logistics Industry,"Very useful book for me. Contents are related to my job functions, it is like a little logistics bible. :)"
2,SquareSoft Does It Again,"I must say ""SaGa Frontier 2"" is one of the best RPG's I've played in a while. The graphics are really impressive and the battle music or the music in general is excellent. However, there is just one small problem, and that is the complex battle system. It took me nearly three days to finally understand it. Also the way you actually learn ""arts"" is frustrating!! If you put aside all of these problems then SaGa Frontier 2 is definetely worth your money."
1,Not what I thought I ordered,I do not think much of this item. It seemed small and not well made at all. Do not order.
1,One of the worst studio recordings of the piece,"This is Karajan at his worst : out of contact with the style and with the music, with a absurd cast (some of it looks interesting on paper, but none of the participants is even close to his/her best). A heavy, clumsy reading, even more clumsily edited (a lot of little mistakes and imperfections due to haste, as bad as in Karajan's Magic Flute). Karajan has at least two great 'live' Giovannis in his output (the 1960 Vienna with Leontyne Price, and the 1968 Salzburg with Ghiaurov and Talvela). This one's for nothing."
2,Love it,This movie was a really good follow up to the first Twilight movie. Definitely ready for eclipse to come out.
1,"""Look Inside""","It would be nice if when you are offered to ""look inside"" the book, the copy you are looking through is the edition that you are buying instead of one ten years older. This ""look inside"" option is not helpful if it is an old edition."
1,HDtv Antenna,"We returned this product for a refund as it did not work any better than the regular antenna we already have. In fact, our regular antenna worked better than this one when placed outdoors (from it's previous location in the attic). This HDtv antenna did not work as well inside or out! Go figure."
1,This book was not helpful in preparing my driving tour.,"We purchased this book in preparation for a road trip in Spain. The maps have no detail and serve no real purpose. The descriptions of locations and drives are scanty and the photos look about 25 years old. This time, the cover sold the book and the inside does not live up to it!"
2,great product,"I love this bed. My grandson sleeps in it while at my house. It is easy to store and it is very, very cute"
2,Hail Terry Brooks,"I have enjoyed a lot of things in life and Terry has been one of the enjoyments. In fact, I believe I read Sword of Shannara before any of Tolkein. In the Wizard at Large, he continues the story and brings it to our world again. Excellently written for the adventurer."
1,"It drags like a wet cigar, chomped half to death in the corner of my mouth","Coen Brother's hit and miss film-making style did it again with this miss. I am a HUGE fan of their work, and an enormous fan of noir. But this was just too dragged out. The cast was great, the characters were great, the film was beautiful, but it was just boring. The narrative was ridiculously cliche, even for the neo-noir genre. It really broke my heart. I had hoped for sooooooooo much more. Go read some Fante, Faust, or rent some good ol' Mike Hammer DVDs."
1,it's a dud,"The story had potential, but ultimately I found it extremely slow and unconvincing. I kept looking at the clock to see when the end would come. If you are looking for great relationship films, try Before Sunrise and Before Sunset."
1,I wish there was a negative star option!,"I gotta say, this company sure does great marketing... but their products aren't that good. I have this camera, and only 7 of the lenses ever work. Most of the time it is one lens thats broken, but mysteriously, sometimes it will fire while another one won't open. That would all be fine, except for the lens itself is complete garbage. The images are dull and a little blurred. Yes I used it in bright sunlight. Yes, the lens just sucks. Also, the exposures completely vary between lenses, so some frames are blown out, while others are underexposed.Seems like a fun idea, ultimately a waste of time and money."
2,Great case!,Love the case great for my new little camera the protection on the side works great-especially when your sons pulls the camera from your purse and drops it when you have only had it a few weeks.
2,The Best.,"I used to be a ska affianado of every sub-genre, which passed with puberty, but now the only ska cd's i listen to regularly are Streetlight Manifesto's 'Everything Went Numb', the first Specials album, the first Fishbone album, The best of the English Beat, and this one. All of those they all stand as great dance records (with the exception SM), but this one stands as a great pop album that even non-ska fans can appreciate because of it's strong melodies and extremly well-written (not just for the genre, but period.) lyrics. Anyone who can put this beside the new catch 22 is and idiot because this was a completly different band, one who actually wrote good songs. Tomas picked up where he left off with Streetlight Manifesto, so for anyone who loves this album should follow them as well."
2,1984 as true today as in 1948,"For those of you who wrote that this novel does not make sense as a vision of the future, and could never happen, I would just ask you to look at Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union from a historical perspective. But, then again, there are 2 billion people in China who can not speak there mind without fear of being arrested and the government has control over how many children they can have. Thank god you live in a country where you can be free to read this novel. The themes are as true today as when Orwell wrote them. The governments desire to control what people will think (See Clinton). Mans inhumanity to man (See Serbs and Kosovo). Children please read the newspaper once and a while."
1,Worthless and tasteless,"I am so sorry I bought this recording. A clerk in a store on Brighton Beach told me that it was some excellent techno, so I believed him and wasted $15 on this worthless record. Tasteless lyrics and unprofessional mixing are enough to give you a headache after 10 minutes of listening. Remixes at the end of the record are make otherwise terrible music even worse. Artists obviously made an attempt to clone the music of European stars, such as ""Masterboy"" or ""Mr. President"", rather than trying to come up with their own musical ideas. The album ends with a ballad, ""Best Friends"", which once again proves that the creators of the album lack one main quality, which is required from an artist to write good music - professionalism. Perhaps next time they should also invite a good designer to work on the cover as well. I want my $15 back, you plagiarsts!"
1,HA!,"I find it interesting that the positive reviews of this film all seem to come in packs during short spans of time, as if someone saw that the film's ratings were suffering and got friends together to all write good reviews.My friends and I like to watch hilariously bad movies, but this one was almost too much; we couldn't finish it. And I watched Howard the Duck the whole way through!Bad movie, plain and simple."
1,TEDIOUS,"This book limped along... Very slow moving, and yeah, how many times is she gonna remind him of that same tired line?Took forever to get started and... *sigh* Im bored just typing this review. Definitely no Michael Baisden, or Eric Jerome Dickey here.Colin 'Waiting in Vain' Channer... where are you?"
2,"""A Christmas Story"" review",I absolutely loved this CD. The group 'Point of Grace' is one of my favorite Christian groups. Their songs touch my heart like no one else does. I still listen to it even though the Christmas season has passed. I play it over and over. The message in these songs is timeless. I highly recommend this CD.
1,Complete Dried UP,"My first bottle arrived with a loose lid. The paint was a solid mass. Amazon shipped a replacement, the replacement also had a loose lid and was also a solid blob. If you need this paint, you need to shop elsewhere."
2,Great for professionals...,"This is what I've always wanted... No problems at all unlike bunch of other stuff out there on market(fogging and skin irritating)... Just fit it and forget it while swimming, it won't even remind you that you are wearing goggles at all, believe me. This product is very reliable... Just perfect for anyone who likes swimming... However better design would be more preferable... Thank you..."
1,Buy lots of spares,"The case is outstanding in the leather portion, but if you have any job or hobbies that involve climbing in, on, or around tight spaces expect to break the clip off the case; numerous times. The other downfall is the Blackberry requires the magnet in the case to lock the phone on holstering, finding aftermarket cases when your on the road all the time is inconvienent so you have to go back to the closest carrier store."
2,Get this for your child!,"This is clear and easy to use reference book. It includes sentences using the words in context, helping with comprehension.As a child I loved to read and write, so at some point in my life my Mom introduced me to a Thesaurus. To this day it is one of my best friends. Thanks mom.There are adults who do not even know what a thesaurus is!Do your kids a favor and introduce them to a thesaurus!"
2,good,simple. works. hard to beat the price. its one of those things that is handy to have around or keep in a bag. never know
1,Missing Source Code Website,"This is a very good book, BUT the support is lousy! There is a reference to download the example source code inside the book (the published link is macosxprogramming.com) but that web link does not have the source code to the book!BEWARE! Before buying this book, check to see if you can get the example code as the book does NOT come with an accompanying CD."
2,Great for the price,Fast shipping! The car charger doesn't work very well but other than that it's worth the price.
2,Great Price,"This book was so much cheaper than my school bookstore this book was here two days after my order, super happy! Thanks"
1,Big Problem,"The item looks lovely but the first one to arrive was smashed and unusable, the replacement had two broken nectar holders (the hanger part smashed) so unusable. I have cancelled any further replacements."
1,Bark Alert,The bark alert does not work at all. We have two Yorkies and we have had the machine for a month and it has not affected them at all.
1,Disappointingly small,"I was hoping for a book of more substance - this book is like getting a brief synopsis of what things a person who has been abused may be dealing with. It doesn't do enough to help a person work through these emotions, or start to overcome them. I think that a person who is looking into self-help books in these situations is already aware enough of what is going on with them - they don't need a list! They need a book with tools to help them. This book does not provide that."
2,DrVelondaReadsSelfAwarnessForYoungWomenWorkbook,"I hosted a recent Princess Party. This book was the best guide for girl talk!I'd love to see every young girl I come into contact with receive a copy of this book.For motivational poetry, prose, quotes and affirmations read:Calm Under Fire"
2,great collection of short horror stories,"If you like fast-paced short stories, this is the book for you. It was my first Stephen King reading. ""The Ledge"" continues to haunt my memory."
1,Complete waste; kids are upset.,"I purchased this guitar for my 14 year old son. On Christmas day, he excitedly opened the guitar. Within one hour, the first string broke. The carrying case has a broken zipper (broken on receipt). Our neighbor, a musician, attempted to fix the broken string with no success. Any new strings would break. I knew that this was a ""deal"" financially, and was just wanting an inexpensive ""first guitar"" for my teen to see how interested he was in playing. Sadly, he was upset that it broke within the first hour. This was his ""big gift"" for Christmas. I will attempt to return the item. Hopefully, the seller will cooperate."
1,WARNING!,"I purchased this toy for a young cat. One day I heard a commotion and went to investigate. The cat had her head stuck in the bottom curved open slot! She could not extricate her head and panicked. Although I was able to help her, it wasn't easy and was a scary experience. I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't been home. I notified the companhy that there should be a warning on the packaging that this item is not safe for kittens or young cats. I also threw out the toy because I didn't want to give it away and jeopardize another cat. Needless to say,this is not a product I would recommend."
1,"With cheap speakers, you get what you pay for, beware","After reading some of the reviews I decided to buy the set of speakers, well, after hooking them up and listening for 5 minutes, they went into the trash can. These have to be some of the worse speakers I have ever heard, very tinny sound, no depth to the music at all. my iphone with the sound turned up and with no headphones connected to it sounds just as good, I guess the bottom line is you get what you pay for and these speaker sound as cheap as the price I paid"
1,"Lies, bias","Book not worth the price I paid. Full o bias and lies. It seems that the more letters they can put after their name, the more they think they are educated. What a bunch of has-beens. They should go back to thleir schools of lower learning. They do not know their Bibles at all. they quote scriptres out of context and know not what they are talking about. Gil"
2,I love penguins,I have four of these penguins. It's nice because they are all stiched differently. It helps to tell them apart because I could get confused because I have four of them. I got a webkinz penguin and it is not as good as these penguins -- these ones look real! I would definitely recommend these penguins to anyone who would like a stuffed penguin. But be careful not to push their beak in -- you might push out the fluff and it wont go back in. And don't love them too much -- they lose their softness.
1,They should have calld it something different.,"After i rented it I went up to people and went ""I saw Saw!"" It sounded stupid i dont like repeating myself like that because you know I like have a really big vocabulary and that makes i tlook like I have a really small one. it was even when the other person said ""i saw saw 2"" because then I like couldn't tell if they saw saw too or saw Saw 2 you know it was totally confusing. It was like this one time at work because i'm a waiter you know and well, this dude told me hed give me a big tip but when i wnet to his table after he left I just found this note that said ""give better service"" i mean, WTF? that wasnt nice. and Where was the tip you know? i hate that dude.Anyway the movies pretty cool i guess. i liked Hostel better though it was rad"
2,The Reality of the Third World.,"Nobody understand how such a painful movie can show the world how many injustice and terror still surfaces on earth and in the face of men. ""Hotel Rwanda"" touches every sense of the human being and the story is not only real for the rwandans but for many third world countries around the globe. This movie is excellent specially the sequence of the scenes and the cinematography. The story that evolves in the events that transform a small African country in the mid-90's and how this matter was taken lightly by the rest of the world, where a genocide was taking place in Rwanda, this is a story of courage of a man that starts from zero to hero. I recommend this movie to understand a little bit more not only about Rwanda, but about the world and the human being itself."
2,NEW DATA,Now also an international healing center is open in Mexico that provides FRS. My new webs have more discussions and you can learn more of my work and new advances in FRS . Also FRs helps women AFTER a hysterectomy
2,nice lens for the price,"a nice lens for the price. however, image is not very sharp at zoom. This is expected I guess for the price range. Focusing is pretty fast too."
2,Great for Classroom Use!,"I discovered this little book while gathering material for my Grades 5/6 poetry unit. Jean Little captures large truths in small poems. Many students, girls particularly, found themselves in several of the selections. One small poem about War has become my introduction for my Remembrance Day unit this year."
1,Disappointed,"I searched and searched for a great pair of shoes for my husband. He has always worn Johnston & Murphy and everyone said these were better. He is on his feet constantly and needs something durable and comfortable. He wore holes in the bottoms of these shoes in two months. We didn't even bother sending them in to get fixed, they were always stiff, they scratched really easily and just weren't great. He went back to a cheaper pair of Johnston & Murphy shoes and they have held up really well and are a lot more comfortable for him. He has a narrow foot and he finds them a lot more comfortable for him than the Allen Edmond's shoes."
2,solid protection,The product is well made and would for sure protect a lens from breakage but it is not coated to prevent secondary reflections.
2,Managing what is left.,It was good for Sen. Chistopher J. Dodd (D) to recommend this book. We need all the help we can get to managing what little is left after government extracts their huge percentage. Read the book and tell Dodd to buy votes with his own money.
2,good taste,This tea has a really great taste even if you brew it for longer than you supposed to. I would recommended it to a tea lover.
1,Do Not Purchase!,I purchased this refrigerator based on the reviews here. It stopped working after 1 month. Customer service has been poor. Would not buy again.
1,Have you ever been in love with someone you hardly knew?,"Well, someone that claims to love Boingo hardly seems to know them at all. This book has many glaring omitions and no actual information about the band members (Excluding Danny Elfman). This reads like a student term paper (I'd give it a ""C""), full of quotes and footnotes and very little original information about the band's politics, fighting and creative process. There were a lot of guys in this outfit besides Elfman that I would have liked to learn more about. The author spends page after page giving his humble opinion about EVERY song on every album. BORING! How about why Kerry Hatch left the band, why did John Hernandez leave and return, etc. This could have been much, much more interesting."
1,Very disappointed,My 9x 9 cake pan starting peeling only after a few uses. The non stick interior coating is coming off in large areas and rusting. Pan is unusable.
1,Not What I Expected,"The fry pan was two inches smaller than expected also there was a big scar inside quite unlike the one advertised. If something is shown, what is bought should not be different."
1,Very Disappointed,"To be fair, I usually do not like opera--hurts my ears.I bought this cd because it has the only aria I have ever really liked on it: Un Bel Di from Madame Butterfly. I heard this on tv years ago and was completely mesmerized by it and have been searching to buy it ever since. This was my 2nd try, and 2nd enormous let down. The sopranos voice is awful--way to high to capture the rapture of the aria. I wish I knew who the woman was who sang it on tv, I think it was a commercial for cars. That was a beautiful rendition."
1,Don't expect to create a master piece on this!,"I got this easel at 75% off. It is quite easy to put together and it looks as good as the picture, except ... the drawing board actually comes in two seperate pieces. This makes drawing/ painting in the middle quite impossible."
2,Salsa brava forever by dj Alex Gee,"This is master piece of the salsa, with a orquest as impacto Crea with a name that only the salsa freaks know what that means: C.R.E.A.Buy this goodone and enjoy it.Alex Gee"
2,stott pilates circle pro,This fitness circlo pro is very strong it will not bend or curl it will be the last one you have to purchase it will last you a lifetime.
1,Horrible,"I am by no means an expert on makeup application, but um I expected to learn something worth the $24. I returned it the next day."
1,Factory problem?,I bought this brand new and sealed but three of the discs are clearly sub-standard with scratches and fingerprints; how can that happen? The result is that 5-6 shows are unwatchable.
2,Good set,You can buy this set with confidence. It is a nice package. The case is nice and the chips are a good size. Very pleased with this purchase.
2,\,"The design of the bottle is great, but the solution is a little strong. However, it works great to clean sinuses!"
2,Great Crunch,"Udi's has great crunch and flavor. Love the macadamia and dried pineapple addition. It could use a few more of each of these, as they seem to pour out in the first few bowlfuls, and then you are left with none."
2,Impressed with Tissot,"This was my first Tissot watch and I'm impressed. The packaging is spectacular... comes in a handsome box and includes a 200 page booklet on Tissot's history. The watch itself has taken one of the top spots among my other 26 watches, with it's weight and heft, attention to detail, build quality and accuracy. I get more comments on this watch than most of my others. I'll be hunting down more Tissot's in the future, based on my experiences with this one."
1,frustration!,"That should be what it is called!It looks like a really cute,fun game but...at least the versions here in Australia--are so hard to use because the Mouse Trap keeps falling apart.It needs to be made better."
1,not very useful,"I bought this item base on the positive review of other users, but I was quite disappointed. The cover deformed after heating up in the microwave and the change is not reversible. Now I have 2 coveres that is curl up and not able to cover and seal any plate or cup. I end up use the rest as cup cover only and I would never put them in the microwave. I bought this item in order to be eco-friendly (cut the use of saran wrap) but this product just does not work."
1,Borrowed Wisdom Not Impressive,"The author borrows from several world belief systems and tries to pass them off as ancient ""toltec"" wisdom. It does contain sprinklings of common sense, but the common sense is offset by impractical application as well as impractical implications. Furthermore, the author contradicts himself at times. On the other hand, if you are a fan of Deepak Chopra you will probably like this book as it is in the same vein."
1,very week,The solenoid doesn't have enough power to open up a trunk. You have to get creative in order for this thing to work. May work great for other applications just not as a trunk release.
1,"good book, not great shipping","This is a good read for any Christian who is about to be married. However, when it arrived it wasn't in very good condition. It was mailed in what looked like a brown bag that had been folded over and taped. Not much protection on the corners, so when it arrived it was bent pretty badly. I wouldn't have cared had it not been a gift. May have arrived a bit nicer had it been in a bubble wrap envelope or a hard cardboard envelope. I would probably order from them again if it was just for myself to read."
2,Does work in short ranges,Seems to work but in short distances. My pet does get a shock and never go back to the same spot again.
1,Poorly Edited...Useless Information for me,"Please check this ""fluff"" book out at you library BEFORE you buy it. It did not meet my needs and I am returning it to Amazon. Keep in mind that anyone can self publish and attempt to market a book for profit. I noticed that whenever someone writes a negative review on this book, there are 3-4 positive reviews written on the SAME day to push the negative review ""off the page"". Check out the numerous 1 and 2 star reviews that have been burried...I agree with them."
1,Can somebody get my voice back?,"I was looking forward to purchasing this 2 CD set for my wife in honor of our 24th wedding anniversary. I popped it in the car and arghhhh! Carole King's voice was terrible! Every song sounded horrible, and some actually were painful to your ears. I will never play this CD again, so if you're hell bent on owning it, I can sell to you real cheap."
2,"Great oils, Amazon sticker annoying","I've used these oils before and they are absolutely wonderful. However, I ordered this trio for a friend's birthday and was unhappy with the Amazon sticker put smack-dab in the middle of the top of the box. I tried to carefully peel it off which made things just as bad! The box was designed to be suitable for a gift, but Amazon ruined that option!!!"
2,No more being left behind!,"The pet stroller is so much fun! I strolled a 5K with my 13 year old scottie and we had such a great time! He loves the action but just can't walk that far anymore. The stroller was very easy to assemble, folds (fairly) flat for storage and transport, is tall enough that I do not have to stoop like with some baby unmbrella strollers and the wheels are large and agile enough to handle a variety of ""road"" conditions. It's terrific."
2,Great overview of coins and collecting,"Never has more information and colorful pictures been packed in such a small book. It was this book that encouraged me to start collection porcelain notgeld. The Contents list does not do justice to all the helpful information given in this book.* The Early Coins* Making Coins* What is in a Coin* Proof and Commemorative Coins and Tokens* Portraits and Pictorialism Marks and Symbols* Date, Legends and Inscriptions* The Coin Collector's GuideJust one chapter alone (What is in a Coin) it covers* Gold* Silver* Copper* Platinum* Nickel* Iron* Zinc* Tin* Lead* Aluminum* Alloys* Non-metallic (pasteboard, porcelain, stoneware, plastic, wood, etc.)* Shape (Square, Triangular, Many-sided, Wavy-sided)And the list goes on.This is defiantly a good starting place and would make a good present."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"It is a waste of money. This book did not help us at all. It is not a standard ""Dummies"" book. It is poorly organized and poorly written. After much frustration, we ended up spending more money to buy Microsoft's Step-by-Step to finally learn everything we needed to know about FrontPage. Spend a little more for Step-by-Step and you won't regret it. If you still want to buy this Asha Dornfest's FrontPage for Dummies, please email me because I have a copy I can't use."
2,There isn't one song on this cd that i don't like!,"After hearing la vida loca for the first time, I knew the song would be a hit, and I was pretty sure the cd would be good- I went to the store two days before it was released to reserve my copy and they gave it to me right there! I was already happy, I put the cd in and sang to la vida loca and haven't taken it out of the stereo since!!! I like every song on the cd, his song with Madonna, his three big singles, his semi-ballads--its all great. I keep thinking that i will get sickl of at least one of these songs- BUT I NEVER DO! Buy this Cd now! You won't regret it and you will know exactly what everyone is talking about."
2,Great Reference,"Very helpful in wound material, used it to help me study for my wound exam. Would recommend for anyone who is taking the exam, also a great reference material."
1,it's good when it works,"I was very excited to get this light, I've been wanting one for a while. After a little it would stop working and so I'd have to tinker around to get it to work. The batteries are not an issue, but getting it to complete the circuit is. When it does work it's very bright and is every thing I hoped for. All in all I would not rely on this light, but I may have just got a lemon."
1,Book of Paranoia,"This is the worse health book I have ever read. All health issues are on parasites, chemicals, and molds and how they invade your body. Reading this book is like entering the Twilight Zone."
1,Grammer,"Did anyone catch the grammatical errors that infected this book? Or just me? I was shocked to see page after page with so many errors. Did no one proofread this ""work"" before turning it in to the printer? I am just curious. Story line was a waste of text. Characters were unbelievable."
2,Awesome set!,"I got this set for my 16 month old son because he has showed interest in food (we're pretty big real foodies in our house) so I thought it would be cool to get him his own food.I really love the concept of the peel and then cut veggies and fruits. It's teaching him that he has to peel some fruit/veggies before he actually has to cut it.I showed him how to use the knife and few times and now he is cutting all the veggies assisted and unassisted. He loves the sound of the velcro being cut (I must have put the onion back together about 50 times in one play session).The only reason I gave the durability of the toy a 4 star is because on the banana the velcro seems to already becoming kind of fuzzy. Otherwise, all the toys are holding up well.All in all, I am happy with the product and my son loves them (that's all that matters!)"
2,Getting a little boring,"I love House the charecter, but the story lines are getting old. Seems like the same show over and over again. It is also time for a change as Cameron, Chase and Foreman are getting annoying."
1,Fair at best,"Pairing was easy, but it seems like every time I try to turn on the device, it's not connecting automatically to my phone. This is not the same trouble that I have had with a plantroics devise. The most dissappointing feature is the mute function. It works well, but there is a set of beeps to alert you that you are in mute mode. Generally that is good, however, the beeps are loud, the beeps happen about every 5 seconds, and lasts about 3/4 a second, and during that time you can no longer hear the call. So, about 20% of the call you are listing to will be covered up by the mute beeps. That's horrible when you are driving and you need to pay attention to a buisness call and want to avoid having them hear your driving background noise. Further, there has to be a close line of site from the devise to the phone, else static can be bad. If I hold the phone behind my back, the static is too much to continue. I am really dissappointed in this devise."
1,Don't Waste Money on Domestc Version,"I am giving the movie only 1 star because of the domestic DVD version of this film. BEWARE!! The movie itself is an awesome film. However, the Japanese release and DVD contain far more detail. Not only is the Japanese version 3 minutes longer, but the Yakuza fight scene is filmed entirely in COLOR. Furthermoe, the Japanese version contains the graphic trunk dismemberment scene of Uma cutting off the other arm of the assistant. The Japanese DVD contains all the same features, and much more! Don't be fooled by the domestic release!"
1,Downgrade from 3 stars to 1 star on the Pike street towels,"I am updating my previous review and I am giving the pike street towels 1 star from 3.I have had these towels now about 8 months, they are already ripping.The towels does not completely do a good job of absorbing water from the body, I have to rub my body more than I normally do.However, the towels size were perfect.I will not recommend these towels."
2,Great little treat/food ball,"The most important thing is to have a cat only household! Our dogs are much more interested in it than the cats are. Actually, if the cats got a chance they would love it!"
2,A comprehensive reference,"""Marxist Thought"" is arranged alphabetically by subject/topic and it thoroughly compiles theories, names, authors, terminologies, etc. that are, or have been, significant to Marxism. The bibliographies that trail each article are *excellent* reading lists towards expanding on the concise topical descriptions provided by the book and, in this sense, the book is extremely useful as a directory. The articles can run several pages or several paragraphs, they are well written, meticulously sourced, and intensely focused. This is a useful and practical book for anyone exploring the vast textual side of Marxism."
2,Almost as good as expected,"I purchased this iron based on many reviews on Amazon. It definitely is a good value for the price, works better than our 10 year old Panasonic one, but not quite as amazing as many say. It leaks a little on the high steam setting, and the iron doesn't get so hot that the clothes get steamed and dried. So I'm only using it in the mid range of the steam setting for everything, and works just fine. It does hold more water than previous irons I've owned."
1,Horrible,"I bought this THING a week ago(6/9/00), it broke today(6/17/00). On top of that, it was sooo hard to grip. I have 10 games and it's bad with all of them. Trust me, get a regular controller."
1,not what I expected,The product took forever to get to me and when it did it was in such bad shape the only place it could go was in the garbage!!! The description said that the record was in good condition - there were so many scratches it was unable to be played. I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT NO STARS!!!!
1,Comments that are not specific to the item's content may not be posted on our site.,"As a dummy, i found this book written in a condescending and haughty tone. Where are the pictures of 50ft women?"
1,Useless,"its pity, that there is no limit in comerciality. the trilogy contains every necessery message.Sorry for the faults and greetings from berlin"
2,Best for Photo Camera,"I bought this case because I wanted something lightweight and practical to carry my Nikon D40 and my laptop through airports and hotels. I figured if I could add a sandwich and some personal papers, bonus.Well it works great for the Nikon with tele lens and accessories but then I got carried away and tried to do the same thing with a video camera. The Sony V1U will fit very snugly but the Z1U will not. The case is just a little too small. If the overall dimensions were increased by a few inches, it would be perfect. Otherwise, it is a really good travel pack at a really good price."
1,15 minutes long :-(,Way overpriced considering it is only 15 mins long and not 40 as advertised. It's not even very interesting either.
1,Worthless,"Only works on unlocked versions of the razr phone. It never detects your phone itself, you have to figure out which phone you have and configure it manually every time. It's completely worthless software. Just download your ringtones, and send your pictures to your own e-mail address. Avoid this junk at all costs, no matter the price (I paid only 11.00$, and I still feel ripped off)."
2,Captivating,It drew me in with it the moment I picked it up and carried me with it since. As good as the Titanic movie. I fell in love with the characters; they seemed so real. A must read.
1,blurry close ups,"great little camera for taking people pictures,but if your an ebayer and need close ups of small items.like watches,forget it,it gets close to item but very blury...."
1,easier to just freehand it,"I've tried to use one of these and they just don't work for me. The mechanism that latches the blade out will let the blade retract the second that you put any significant pressure on it. I usually end up either just using a razor blade with no holder or else an automotive style gasket scraper razor blade holder that doesn't retract if I really need a handle. The concept is good, a razor blade holder that you can keep in your pocket or toolbag while you're working, but it just doesn't work in practice."
1,Varley By The Numbers,"This novel reads as if it was written to fulfill a contractual obligation. Sloppy, passionless, and ultimately pointless.Hopefully, the new novel to be published this fall will represent a return to form for this once passionate visionary."
2,Struck me as one of the more sincere auto-bios,"I've very much enjoyed Mr. Caine as an actor and I purchased the hardback edition in 1993 (or 1992?) at his book-signing event in San Francisco. I was very surprised to meet a ""celebrity"" who came across in such a pleasant and informal manner that I felt as if I were talking to a favorite relative. I had primarily been impressed by his willingness to take on a variety of roles simply out of his love for acting. My brief encounter with him left me even more curious about the overall character of the man. His bio was a very insightful read. If you like the man's work, you'll be delighted and amused by this book."
2,Good ministry,"I enjoyed the release from Antonia. It was very refreshing to hear the song ""Butterfly"". I heard Antonia in concert with the group Isaac Mullis and Divine Promise and another act. Divine Promise is also on the Trigospel label. The show I saw was awesome and I bought both the Divine Promise and the Antonia cd. It is well worth it to buy these trigospel products.Keep up the good work and bless you all."
1,Buy only if you like rerecords,"I am a big Stella fan and have many of her songs on '45. So I was delighted to see an anthology and could hear the old songs again without the scratches. Was very disappointed as the songs, especially the hits are rerecords. If you like the original songs, don't buy this album. If you don't really care, then the songs are close enough to be a good listen."
1,WAY OVER RATED!!,"Was very dissappointed ... there were hardly any recipes in the book which is what I was looking for and wanted one for a gift and feel it is now a ""throw away""! I did get excellent shipping service but that is the only good thing about this purchase."
2,Magformer Fun,"Great toy for any age - babies through senior citizens. There are no sharp corners, very colorful, and require imagination. I played with them with my 3 year old grandson and he loved putting them together."
2,Completely love it.,"One of the best things I've bought. It IS delicate and I learned that the hard way unfortunately. A friend of mine smacked my hand for whatever reason and it bent so I'll be ordering another one soon.. (along with two additional ones for my two best friends). It came in a nice little box with a bow on it. I've had it for over a year and wear it almost every day. (I'm not one for jewelry but I loved this ring). Great buy and I WILL be ordering from this company again. You see in the picture exactly what you get in the mail and for the price, you can't go wrong."
1,Turd Alert!,"This album is an absolute shocker and Blur realised it. This is easily Blur's worst effort and has some truly awful tracks to prove it. Mr Robinson's Quango and Dan Abnormal are top of the list. Every time Damon sings 'I want McNormal and chips or I'll blow you to bits' it never fails to make me cringe. If it wasn't for the awesome The Univesal this album would have had one star, unfortunately the bad tracks out-weigh the good ones on this. Buy Modern Life is Rubbish or Blur but not this turd of an album."
2,Comfortable bra,"I wear a 34DDD and was pleasantly surprised at the lift this bra gave me for a leisure bra. This is my second Glamorise Complete Comfort Bra. The last one I had was the Pinkish/nude color. I had it in the wrong size (36) and it didn't give me the same lift. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that the front is a little uncomfortable from the trim scratching along the bottom seam. The other one I had didn't have that problem. I don't know if a different material is used (it feels the same) or it's because it was too big so it didn't rub at all. With that being said, I still wear it and will buy another one when this one starts to wear too much."
1,victor 00402-8 EZ fix rubber tire patch kit,I have order 4 of your tirer patchs @ .88 cents each paid 5. and change But I ony received only one So when will i be get the other 3
2,Great Gift!,"The case is almost as good as the great baby care products inside. The CD is cute as well, but not what I expected. Would have been nicer had it been more a bath time fun CD i.e. splish splash, rubber ducky, etc.."
1,"Interesting, but not that exciting","I enjoyed this DVD as a relatively new Led Zeppelin fan. It was interesting hearing about the band and how they came to be, but I would have liked to have heard from the 4 geniuses themselves. A little blurb here and there of past interviews was good, but it would have been better to hear from them present day. We didn't get to hear any of their music and that was unfortunate. A little bit of history to this great band, but lacking in content."
1,Big Time Rip ...,"This book is pathetic. I used it with no success. Let me share some reasoning with you. First of all, the author is NOT an MBA and has never worked on an admissions committee. He spends half the book thinking about what things he THINKS they look for. This book is referred to as a ""bible"" because it's as long as one. Montauk is right on many common sense points. If he feels the need to explain why he's right, he could give just 2 or 3 reasons instead of 20 or 30. (Hence, the ridiculous length.) I'm now using an admissions consultant who gave me advice on why I was rejected and what to correct this coming fall. My consultant is an MBA with admissions committee experience. I believe I'll have better luck this time around!"
2,I Like it a Lot,"I like this pastry mat a lot. The only complaint, a fairly minor one, is that the material is a little more rigid than I would prefer, making it difficult to roll up for storage. Similarly, when it's unrolled for use it doesn't readily flatten out on the work surface. What I need to do is figure out a way to store it in its flat (unrolled) mode.... perhaps strong magnets on the side of the refrigerator."
2,Almost a masterpiece,"Writing a good alternate history novel must be incredibly tricky. Usually stories set in alternate universes are merely an excuse for the author to show off how clever and imaginative he is. With The Plot Against America, Philip Roth almost makes the perfect alternate history novel. Almost.If there are flaws in the novel, they come at the very end. The first 300+ pages are expertly written with a palatable sense of dread, but all that comes to naught if you can't deliver a satisfying ending. With his climax, Roth strains credibility.Roth is one of my favorite authors, but here he seems to have grown tired of writing the book and just wraps things up as quickly and effortlessly as possible. I so wanted to give this book five stars. I just can't."
1,"The recipes are gluten free, but healthy it's not!","I read all the reviews before I bought this book and assumed it was a good book for people allergic to gluten looking for 'healthy' recipes. If you consider brown sugar, confectioner's sugar, white sugar, corn syrup, margarine, Butter Flavored Crisco, canned vegetables, and soda 'healthy' ingredients then by all means this book is for you. But, if you're like me and have health problems then I would suggest not buying this book. You'd be better off buying prepared gluten free flour and adapting recipes you already have.Many of the meat and vegetable recipes are just wasting space in the book. How hard is it to prepare poached salmon, three bean salad, or cole slaw without gluten?I am returning the book to Amazon because I cannot use it."
2,Neutrogena body oil is the absolute best way to keep your skin healthy,"I've been using neutrogena body oil for the past several years. I put it on just after I finish my shower before drying myself. I have very dry skin plus live in very dry high altitude location and neutrogena body oil really helps. Another really good thing is that my shower does not get oily, I am careful, but still some lands in the shower and yet has never been a problem."
2,Excellent Story--Better than the TV Series,"Note: This is more of a comparison to the TV Series than an actual review. It's mainly meant for those wondering if the Air movie is worth a purchase after having seen the series. Spoiler-free.I liked the story of the Air movie a LOT more than the series. All the plot elements that I thought were silly and/or convoluted in the TV series were removed in the movie. Everything was explained clearly, and the story just made more sense. To me, it was a lot more believable and much more touching. I'm glad I didn't just dismiss it just because I wasn't crazy about the series.If you enjoyed the series, however, I see no reason why you wouldn't also enjoy the movie. It's a completely new story, but the characters' personalities are left more or less in tact."
1,amazon sells garbage,"well everything was fine until i pushed played to watch the movie, i could hear the video but i would not see anything, my tv,and bue-ray are 3d, i dont know why this people from amazon dont answer my e-mails i already told them whats going on like a month ago and still i havent heard anything back."
1,OLD AND STALE!,"My kids love these fruit roll ups and I remember having them as a child so I was delighted when I saw I could buy a large box. However, when they came we were disappointed! The were were very old and hard... We only opened one and it broke into pieces. Because it's a food item, you can't return which I think is ridiculous...we couldn't even eat them! I order lots of stuff from Amazon and have had a great experience except for these fruit roll ups. Don't buy food from Amazon! (The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I had to click on something and they did arrive on time)."
1,IT'S A LET DOWN,"I'm a HUGE fan of ""The Perfect Storm"", but this book didn't grasp me.You really want to believe there's a chance that Smith is innocent, but there's just no way it's possible. I think this would've been a better Novel than a Non-Fiction book.I feel that some of the story was unbelievable. I just feel LET DOWN!!!"
1,"Do not be conned, please.","Evidence? Scientist? Hmmm.It's sad that the standard of scientific literacy in our communities is so low that anyone can be conned by this fraudulent rubbish.It's also sad that people are so insecure in their faith that ""Lying for God"" has become a big money spinner in the USA and is becoming so in other parts of the world.You can get better science in a high school text book and better Christianity in the Bible Handbook at your local library. Stay away from this for God's sake."
1,Not hot enough for computer soldering,"As a computer tech working on motherboard connections I found this soldering iron didn't melt the solder enough to actually desolder the component. I bought a Weller (35W) iron the next day. It's working fine. For the price I paid for the first soldering iron, it's not worth a trip to the post office to return it."
1,Crap!,This never worked. I called the manufacturer and they wouldn't do anything. I sold it at a yard sale for $1 and I feel ikie I took advantage of the guy.
2,www.glasswerk.co.uk review,"What a welcome break to the likes of David Sneddon this is from ex Mercury Rev Keyboardist Adam Snyder. Taken from last September's album 'Across the Pond', this is the first release from the long player courtesy of a remix from Marcus De Vries. Harking back to early drug induced acoustic ramblings of the progressive American folk era 'Two Moons' blends traditional country styles with modern swirling keyboard segments. Driving its way into your head, the soft vocal forces a subconscious effort to sing along while the hand uncontrollably clicks to the pop beat. The B-side 'Road Song' could easily be straight out of your uncle's numerous truck driving compilations such is the simplicity of the claw hammer guitar style and blues tinged vocals. Judged by this single release, if you haven't already had a listen to the album then go and do it... Now!Seph"
1,Little or no specific information in the book,"I bought this book because I was seriously considering adding some solar elements to my current home, and I'm currently planning a new home that I wanted to incorporate as many features as possible. Unfortunately, this book did little more than gloss over the absolute basics about solar power. While it claims to include the equations you need to design a solar energy system, that claim is grossly overstated. Repeated throughout the text are reasons WHY solar energy is good for the environment, but the author has done more harm than good by producing a book that doesn't enable anyone to really go out and do it."
2,Quality Fragrance,"I first encountered this fragrance as a sampler and initially disliked it. It has a sweet character but not as abrasive as, say, Angel Man---similar but not quite as in your face and not as chemical. The top citrus notes are fresh and there is no getting around the overall complexity of the elements, especially the florals. Excellent longevity with a somewhat feminine dry down. Avoid over application so that you are not a scent 'bomb' for the first hour.This cologne, more-so than any other I've tried, evokes physical responses from people. They will either love it and want to 'eat you up' or they will look at you funny and perhaps sic a pit-bull on you.Good luck. Highly recommended."
2,"Great product, fast shipping!","Buyer provided exactly what was needed in a timely fashion. Also, this shipper was light on the packaging, which I appreciate for environmental reasons.Great vendor! Will certainly consider using them again."
1,Fragile and handle with care,"I thought they are nice and bought 4 sets when they are on sale. However it is very disappointing to receive it. They do not look as nice as from the pic. It feels like plastic rather than glass because it is very thin. Also, it is very fragile. I do not recommend it."
2,"Gorgeous photography, engaging, straight forward text.","For those of us who live in the western states, this book is an invaluable rescource. Ms. Sprenger offers great advice on learning how to cope with poor soil conditions (such as sand and clay), how to acheive a lushly planted look by relying on hearty (yet beautiful) native plants that won't let you down when the going gets tough, and absolutely wonderful planting designs and combinations. Her style is engaging and entertaining to read, as well as forthright and full of plenty of personal anecdotes and tidbits. Her photogrophy alone is worth the price of the book. Even if you don't live with poor soil, nasty weather and a stunted growing season, there's much to learn here. A great book, one of my favorites! A destined 'green' classic."
1,Paper Eater,My girlfriend and I used this printer for less than a year before it began to give us paper troubles. It started by losing its alignment and then began to mangle the paper on its way through the printer. We both need to print plain boarding passes so you can imagine the trouble this causes when the scanners at the airports can't read the printed pass. We recommend that you pay a little extra and get a printer that isn't made to last a day longer than its warranty.
2,iPod charger,"This is a cute, convenient-to -use product that works perfectly. And what a great price!"
2,"Great Cd, but not a good as everything must go","This is a great cd. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is i don't think it's quite as good as ""Everything Must Go"", it should get 4 3/4 stars. But I still LOVE this cd. The songs ""Tsunami"" and ""If you tolorate this then your children will be next"" are my favorite songs. But this CD went triple platnim already and its about time it came over to the states. Its more of a complete album than their last. And well worth a listen."
1,Great but bad,"I would give this game a perfect 5 but I'm amazed at how dark the screen is! When I first turned it on I could barely see anything. I had to sit next to a bright light and awkwardly hold it up. This is a MAJOR flaw. No matter how good the game is it will never live up to it's full potential thank to the GBA's poor lighting. That aside, the GBA's graphics are amazing after playing the old Game Boy. The Super Nintendo graphics are still welcome in the hands of gamers and the audio is surprising good. The screen size should be bigger but with color and great graphics the picture is still easy to see. That is, if you've got a bright light to sit next to."
1,Where is my DVD?,I have ordered and paid for this item but not yet received it so hard to review. Please send my item
1,dont spend this much,"please DO NOT spend this much for one of these robes.i gave 1 star only because of the price. if it had a hood i'd prolly rate it higher. walmart has a version of the same robe for under $20 also available in pink. don't know if it is the exact same. i purchased a black one last winter that i expect to last @ least 2 more winters, in fact i may get the pink one this winter just to have a change up. in combination with a pair of matching bootie slippers i feel totally pampered w/o paying a ridiculous price.not as plush as the two short hooded robes i bought @ target the year before but still very nice."
1,Not worth your time in reading this book,Giving up America wa a very boring book with a bad storyl-line. I kept thinking that something more exciting would happened in the story but unfortunaltely it did not. The characters were not well developed and one could not identify with any of them. Pearl Abraham better take more courses in writing!!
1,are you kidding me?,"Seriously. An ""OWNER'S"" manual? OWNER. Right. Here in America, men do not OWN their sex partners, wives, girlfriends, or lovers. That right there should tell you how much respect this author has for women. Seriously, do not give this guy even one of your hard-earned dimes."
2,Pulp horror at its most stupidly entertaining!,"Littered with grammar and spelling mistakes, but overlook this and you can have hours of fun with this one. Giant crabs once again attack England, creating havoc and tearing people apart with their pincers! I get the feeling this was written with teenage readers in mind but even if you`re an adult(!) you will have a whale of a time. The characters are right out of a Grade Z sci-fi film of the 1950s, the story is rather predictable but nonetheless great fun and the gory scenes are somewhat silly. Great for a beach read, but watch out for those crabs! Click-click-clickety-click!"
2,Speedo Auqa Fitness Barbells - Shoddy Chinese Construction!,"I purchased a pair of the Speedo Aqua Fitness Barbells and am very upset to have one of them fall apart within the first five minutes of use!!!I put it back together several times throughout my two hour pool stay. It just would not hold together! The other one held together fine. They would be wonderful if they were well made!!! The one did a nice job of giving me a workout.UPDATE - Once i got put some glue to them, they have stayed together, well. They work very well, now! I'm glad I purchased them, even though they needed a little TLC. Realy give you a workout!!!"
1,"Not particularly good, and certainly not worth all the accolades it received...","This was mildly entertaining. It just seemed like an excuse to play a lot of songs from the 1960's, and for baby boomers to reminisce about historical events in their lives (of which Gump was at all of them). Why this won so many awards is highly questionable. The only reason I can think of is that it's easy and not too controversial; it's the safe choice. The Academy has been known to do that (remember the Crash and Brokeback Mountain controversy?). Tom Hanks really didn't deserve an Academy Award here, not that he isn't a fine actor (he is), but because the performance is not particularly challenging. It's a rather simple performance where he's just playing an ""aw, shucks"" kind of guy. The special FX were really no big deal (even though the press told us they were), and look quite ordinary today. Reportedly, the original novel was much more satritic and darker. I should read it. It's probably better than the film."
2,Every major theater venue should mount a production!,"Personals is a delightful, entertaining, and provocative musical. Songs are catchy, memorable, and the CD features great voices and instrumentals. I saw the original production off-Broadway and waited for years for this recording. At last! The highlights of the show are the songs by Joel and Seth Friedman. They have a gift for melodic writing and their songs abound with musical twists and turns that make them, by far, the most rewarding, moving, and creative work on the CD. I hope to hear more from them!"
2,Analytical methods,"This book is by far the best in the field of geometrical optics dealing with 3-d, 5-th and higher orders aberrations in symmetric optical system. The language is very clear and easy to follow, it is written for a broad audience. I would personally recommend it for all how has an interest in the theory of optical aberrations."
2,Shift Improver Works Great!,"The electronic shift improver worked great on my 94' chevy k1500. The tranny has 170,000 miles on it but shifted like new. The shifts are sluggish though especially with the 35"" tires I have on it. The electronic shift improver installed very easily. All I had to do was cut and splice two wires from the plug-in attaching to my computer box. It works instantly putting more pressure in your transmission lines. I normally run stage one and the shifts are wonderful. Stage 2 feels like a performance offroad shift kit... almost too much banging into gear sometimes! Overall great product and cheap without having to remove transmission pan."
2,A Must Read!!!!!,"I have always been a little shy when it comes to ""going down."" I had read a few of the authors other books, and recently came across this one. I thought the title was too cute to not read...bascially it made me curious. So I bought it, and I recently finished the book. I think it's one of her best because not only does it have great illustrations with every technique described, but the content was fun and lighthearted and made me laugh a few times. When I showed my boyfriend, he was so excitied about it that he wanted us to try a few of the techniques. We have been trying a few new ones nightly....and I'll tell you....they have really put that extra uummmppppphhh that we have been missing for awhile. This is a book that both you and your man will REALLY ENJOY! :)"
2,Cute Kids Movie,"Disney delivers again with their standard style of story-telling and top notch animation. Of course, it's just in time for their seasonal merchandising opportunities, too."
1,Be aware that,"when I tried to call the response is, the number you have dialed is disconnected and not in service. I wondered why they were marked down now I know. Works ok, but you had better not want any service."
1,Don't know what the problem is,"Recently received this as a gift. When I initially cleaned it with water, I followed cleaning directions and got a nice mist of water, then when I filled it half-way with grapeseed oil it didn't work at all.I will follow one of the other posts that suggest rinsing in hot water. If this does not work I will try to return it! I cannot believe I didn't even get a single good use from it.It is a great idea though, if it only worked."
1,A Book I Wished I Hadn't Read,"This book is a paradox. On the one hand, the writer obviously has talent. The writing itself is good, the characters are well-drawn. The author gives us a glimpse into Middle-Eastern culture that is quite interesting. But the characters act in ways that are simply incredible over and over again and it hurts the books credibility. They are also soulless. For this book to work as a poignant tragedy, the reader must come to care for these characters--and I believe the opposite happens. They are the architects of their own disaster and the reader is only able to stand apart and watch, incredulous, instead of being drawn in. So the tragedy is a minor hiccup in the universe, not a moment of universal truth. If you want to read about the fall of a noble man, read The Great Gatsby. If you want to ponder the naturalistic universe, read Theodore Drieser. Don't read this. I taught English for 17 years so I would like to think this is an informed opinion."
1,Erroneous & sloppy Marxist propaganda,"In 1981 the Princeton historian David Abraham published The Collapse of the Weimar Republic. The book, which was initially well received in academia, sought to demonstrate a connection between ""organized capitalism"" and the rise of the Nazi party during the Great Depression. While Abraham avoided the simplistic equation of capitalism and fascism, his structuralist-Marxist approach could not accommodate the findings of the Yale historian Henry Turner, whose prior articles successfully disproved the suggestion that German industry, before 1933, supported Hitler to any great extent, either financially or ideologically. When researchers checked the accuracy of Abraham's evidence, they found a number of serious errors in his footnotes. Abraham cited documents that did not exist and turned paraphrases into quotes."
2,Wow,"And I thought ""Midnight Express"" tore me up.This is a must-see. You will be pretty fried when it's all over, but it's well worth the emotional journey.Highly recommended."
1,Not What I Expected.,"In a sense, a biblical novel is a historical novel. The writer must not inject her own theories that run perpendicular to the grain of history or to the Scriptures. A writer of an American Civil War history, for instance, would be doing his readers and history itself a great injustice if he portrayed Abe Lincoln as a pacifist. The Red Tent does just this sort of thing. Joseph married and had two sons, both blessed by Jacob and both becoming patriarchs to a half-tribe of Israel. He was a heterosexual, but Ms. Diamant portrays Joseph as a homosexual. This is not only historically innacurate but offensive to Conservative Jews and to others who take the Torah seriously. Not only is the book not based on good history or the Scripture, it is not a very well written book-- quite boring in fact. I give it one star because the cover illustration is beautiful."
2,Love this product!,I love this headrest! We used it with our daughter from day one coming home from the hospital and still use the larger one now and she is 4 months old. You have to use both together when they are newborns and it supported her head wonderfully. Much better than the one that came with our carseat. The velcro straps secure the smaller one to the larger one to hold them in place (this took us a little while to figure out-but it works great!) I recommend it to all my friends with newborns.
2,Good Product,"As a basic checkbook and credit card holde, it does the job well in good style! I'd recommended it to other consumers."
1,Good-Bad Movie,"Belushi is soooo embarrassingly bad that his performance actually makes the movie worthwhile.The film overall you ask ? Well, there's a very good reason for its relative obscurity...it's just awful."
2,Interesting....,"But sad and depressing. Definitely a classic that needs to be on your Post Apoc ""Read It"" list, but don't expect to come away from it feeling all warm and fuzzy."
2,Well Written & Helpful,"""The New Love and Sex After 60"" is a well written and helpful book. There is no question that older men and women may want to remain sexually active much longer than might have been supposed. The authors explain some of the normal changes brought about by aging and changing relationships. They also discuss possible issues brought about by illness. The tone throughout is upbeat and positive and the authors offer practical advice for maintaining a healthy intimate relationship. It's probably time for another revision that would cover a few more recent developments in medicine but this book is still worth reading."
1,Worse Reception than a Kid Dressed in Tin Foil,"This product simply does not work!I received better reception from my receiver without the use of an antenna.I tried to connect this using both the dual wire method and the provided cable jack. Nothing!I do live in a condo with mostly concrete walls, but when the product is placed by the window, the reception still does not improve.This product only gets 1 star because I can't give it 0."
2,junto a la lluvia,"estos chicos son dos excelentes compositores,la voz de Daniel Guerrero especialmente es mil veces mas profesional que la de beto cuevas,no entiendo porque no tienen la suerte que se merecen,supongo que es falta de conciencia de su compañia"
2,Bread Givers,"I really enjoyed Bread Givers by Anzia Yezierska. It was a book that I felt that others might be able to relate to. Bread Givers was a riveting read that I did not want to have to put down. It answered many questions thatI had about Jewish Life in the early 1900s, but it left many questions unanswered. I would definetly reccomend Bread Givers to any one that is interested in reaidng a book about fairly new immigrents struggling to live in New York at the turn of the 20th century."
1,"Overwrought, rambling","I started reading this and at first it seemed like the author could write. But then he piled on cliche after cliche, and seemed to have a compulsion to over-describe everything, trying too hard to be picturesque or literary. This made the whole thing seem forced. It also made the book ramble. It seems that so many writers about surfing have to drag in all kinds of literature, history, mythology, psychology, philosophy and religion to make the topic relevant or appealing. This isn't really necessary and it seems awfully artificial. Just another attempt to cash in on the surfing craze? I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Awesome,"I had two other safety razors, and this razor is incrediable. I would recommend this to anyone. Plus, it looks to be very solid. The weight is perfect."
1,Don't waist you money,"This is a $5 movie at best or rental. I love si-fi, but this is week at best. I cannot recommend paying for this movie!The quality of the produce was fine by the way."
1,Louder than a Diesel engin,"The pump sounded like a good deal--SOUNDED is the word that needs to be taken into account here. I bought the pump for a reef aquarium. Before I installed the pump all I could here was the trickle of water from the other pumps. Turned this one on, and I thought I was in the middle of the freeway. LOUD!!! Other reviewers had said it was loud--I should have listened. I will be returning it this week. HyperFlow--It should be named HyperSound"
1,Why can't they have a 0 star rating?,"I'm 16 now, and I remember most Disney movies with that warm, fuzzy feeling. I was at a friend's house and noticed Pocahontas and thought, I haven't seen that in years! Let's watch it! Then she said, We both remember the first one. I think we have the second one somewhere, let's watch that! So, we popped it in, and stared in dismay as it got worse...and worse...and worse. The history, for one, destroyed it, since I tend to like accurate things. Then, Smith comes in and the other guy(Rolf?) is heartbroken. Mmm hmmm. And Pocahontas saves Smith in the first one, and chooses Rolf in the second, and Smith WALKS AWAY like nothing happened? Take human nature into consideration: he would NOT have been so peaceful. Well, I guess if the kids didn't see/didn't like the first one, they'd like it. I personally hated it with a passion. Don't buy this. Rent it or borrow it. Please."
2,"Departure from earlier style, but still good","I think people are being a bit unfair about this album. I will admit that it's a total change from their first album with its upbeat dance style, but ""If You Don't Know"" shouldn't be passed off at first glance. The songs on this album range from dance to R&B; to rap. Although I prefer the dance songs, I have to admit that the soft, slow R&B; style isn't all that bad.If you also enjoy Temperance's dance music, I highly recommend ""Hands of Time"" and ""Dancing in the Key of Love"" as the best songs on this CD. However, other dance tracks include ""Chains of Love"", ""Believer"", and ""Until You Opened Your Mouth"", which are all great tracks to put on as well.Give a listen to the samples and see for yourself that this album isn't as bad as other reviewers are saying!"
2,I LOVE THIS MOVIE,"This is one of my favorite movies. It has everything that you could want in a movie. There is action, suspense, love (not in a lustful way but a father daughter type love), good and evil, and unpredictability. Gary Oldmen is a great bad guy that you could realy hate and you realy grow attatched to the main characters. I'm not going to say to much about the movie because i don't want to ruin it for you but this is a movie that almost any person would love."
1,THE WORST OF KEITH RICHARDS MUSIC,I'm a fan of THE STONES & KEITH but this is just throw away filler.GAWD it is terrible. Not 1 memorable tune here. Plus his back up band is boring. No life here.
1,Intel Powered Mac? - forget Dymo printers,"Dymo's website has a software download for Intel power Macs - this software does not work at all - even though the Mac ""sees"" the Dymo sitting on a USB port it cannot print to it - after a friendly geek struggled with it for the better part of a hour it finally decided to print labels - even the geek does not know what he did to make it print - so - if it goes down - it goes to my physical trash bin - get with it DYMO - Macs are taking over the computer world"
2,"Aerosmith's Greatest Hits,Volume Two","Here are Aerosmith's best from their Geffen Records era. They signed with the label in 1985 after reforming(they disbanded in 1980). The original tracks are ""Walk On Water"" and ""Blind Man"",the latter becoming a hit. The other 13 tracks are from PERMANENT VACATION,PUMP,GET A GRIP and THE BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD EXPERIENCE. There are no tracks from the band's first Geffen album DONE WITH MIRRORS. Most of the tracks on this album would be recycled for OH YEAH! ULTIMATE AEROSMITH HITS in 2002."
1,Doesn't fit my camera,"I bought this battery off Amazon because all the sellers listed it would work with my new Z1485 IS camera, but the battery doesn't even fit! The way they packaged it together, the excess plastic inhibits movement into the battery chamber, and it's a total waste because I bought the charger too. Disgusted."
2,Necessity,"I thought this book was excellent. It's a must read/great reference for the serious student of the western mystic tradition.My only caution would be to be careful. This isnt really ""paperback"" kind of material, and Im not sure about the wisdom of making it so public."
2,Loved the characters,The characters in this book were my favorite part. I could feel the pain of all of them. It was also a great story--completely unpredictable.
1,Very disappointing,"I like the idea of just having the small switch on the desktop with no software to install, but I've since disconnected it. It ended up locking up the keyboard and or mouse so that I couldn't work on a regular basis. All of a sudden, it would be like a key was stuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. I would definitely not recommend buying this KVM switch."
1,Stay with the Lord!,"I wanted to write, about this book to let my family and friends know how powerful this book is. The truths on this book makes us believe that many people do talk and don't do the walk...the Lord Jesus Christ will lead us the the right direction if we do the walk and not just talk. People should trust the Lord Jesus Christ to do what ever they want just by trusting in him. Let him take control not you...and see what happens...everybody needs to live and do what God wants them to be, loyal, honest."
1,Worst buy I ever made,"The endurance of this model was 4 months. First, I had to replace it due to a display annoying noise.The replace unit did not work if I carry it in my pocket. I believe this could be the result of a very bad connection, and a minimal stress damages the whole thing.Once, I carried it in my pocket and I had to attempt turning the machine on five times. Finally it turned on but the monitor did not respond. So, I pressed the display with more effort and it became smashed!!!I cannot believe I spent my money in this not robust at all machine.I strongly recommend not buying the Tungsten E, and after having a Palm device I suggest buying a PDA from another company."
2,I buy all my books here,I love amazon cos I am in milary right now and where am at I don't get much pay plus I have to pay half of my tuition and bye my own books so I can't afford new one. I know I can always trust amazon for the same book for less.
2,the best underated duo of the 80's,"WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SONG"" ALWAYS SOMETHING THERE TO REMIND ME "" WHICH IS EVEN A REMAKE, MOST PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW THIS DUO YET IF YOU LISTEN TO SOME OF THERE SONGS ITS REALLY YOUR MONEY'S WORHT TO BUY THERE ALBUM. MOST OF THERE SONGS FIND THERE WAY THRU MOBILE MIXERS BUT TRY TO LISTEN TO THE SONG "" WHEN THE LIGHTS GO ON"" WHICH IS NOT EVEN INCLUDED HERE THEN YOU COULD SAY THAT THIS DUO COULD HAVE BEEN MORE SUCCESFUL. TOO BAD FISHER IS NOW GONE AND THERE WON'T BE ANY MORE NAKED EYES ALBUM. I RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE OUT THERE CHECK OUT THEIR FIRST ALBUM ENTITLED NAKED EYES AND YOU HEAR WHAT I MEAN"
2,journalist perspective of the war in Nicaragua,"Overall this was a good detailed read about the Sandinista revolution and the contra war from a New York Times journalist's viewpoint. He spread the blame around to about all parties involved.There is minimal info on pre-Sandinista revolution history.Author sprinkles the book with a few pages patting himself on the back, regarding peripheral journalistic acomplishments, but these can be skimmed over or forgiven.I wish all history books would contain a couple of pages with the timeline of important events. Like most books, this one does not."
2,Great add-on for a laptop,I recently bought this speaker for my wife's new laptop.** Minimizes wires and keeps the counter clean (USB connection/power)** Alternate line jack and a/c adapter** Great sound (it has a rear subwoofer port)** Volume control on top right with plenty of range
1,Not Italian or French,"When I bought these mushrooms before, they were clearly labled ""from Italy"". This time, the origin is not mentioned on the bag, and when I checked their website, I see they've written a bunch of malarky about how porcinis'taste the same wherever they're from, even from North America or China. That is just not true. Porcini from Europe taste better: the terroir changes the mushroom's flavor considerably, just as it changes the flavor of grapes made into wine. Since JR Mushrooms refuses to reveal their country of origin, I must assume they are selling cheaper, possibly contaminated mushrooms from China in order to make a bigger profit. Beware! Buy another brand."
1,Decent candles...but wouldn't repurchase,"The candles burned steadily for over an hour without excessive wax drip. The colours were a bit melted together when they arrived, but once I separated them, they functioned ok. Unfortunately about 5 minutes into the spell a demon from the netherworld was summoned. He ate the red and blue candles, but the purple remained intact.The demon consumed my soul. Would not buy again."
1,Lasted two rounds,"I wanted to believe a 20 dollar club would work, especially considering how rarely a 64 wedge is used. On my 2nd round with it, which was 8 swings total, the shaft snapped in half. Upon inspecting it, I can't believe these clubs even stay togther. The wall thickness of the shaft is absurdly thin. Time for me to buy a real wedge."
1,Item is NOT as pictured,"The clock's face looks like a nice cool blue-green LED in the photo, and the plastic overlay it ships with is basically that same color. But the clock itself has ugly yellowish numbers, sort of the color of infected mucus. (Holding the plastic shipping overlay next to the powered-on clock is almost comical, the difference is that extreme.) Given that the main appeal of this clock -- the only way it differs substantially from so many others available here -- is the color of the numbers, I can't possibly recommend this to anyone who isn't colorblind."
1,Does Not Stick,I wish that would actually work. It sounds like a great idea especially during summer but this product doesnt even work. It would not stick to my dress shirts so what's the point. You might as well use tissue and put it around your armpit.
1,COMICAL IN IT'S BIAS !,"The only believable character in this liberal tripe , is Matt Dillon , who is supposed to be cast as a villianous prosecuter.In actuality , he has far more compassion , for this misguided fool than is called for. The silly , self righteous reporter both loses and gets , just what she deserves.Alan Alda is simply embarassing !Horrible Movie !"
2,the great movie,this is the best movie for kids the ages 7-13 and it is the cutest movie and it might be a little scary for little kids but it is deffenitly a GREAT movie for the whole family to watch together i watched it at my halloween party and everyone enjoyed it!!!!!!!!!!(:
2,almost perfect for me,The one thing that was a little annoying was the fact that the Erinee was so bent on hateing Christopher that she didnt come off as a very likeable character for me.I am all for the main characters hating eachother in the beginning and toward the middle but Ms. Woodwiss dragged it out till the last 50 pages or so.I mean she knew that her father wasn'tthe most honest of men and she wouldn't give Christopher the time of day or let him tell his story.Christopher was very determined in what he wanted and I knew right away what he was trying to do but I loved the story line and ho9w he went about it.
2,An Excellent Anthology,"This is one of the best versions of the Trova Cubana songs, performed by one of the best and talented voices of Venezuela.It's a masterpiece in this kind of music."
1,Fan Noise is Very Loud & High Pitched,"CONS:- Fan noise is very loud & irritating, causing me to return the item to Amazon. (This problem was also noted by a reviewer at NewEgg, who returned the item for a video card with passive heating.)- Did not increase Vista rating for 3D gaming graphics. (I got a Vista rating of 3.0 for 3D graphics, which is the same rating I had before on the same system using the onboard ATI Radeon Xpress 200, which only has 128 MB of shared memory).PROS:- Increased Vista rating for Desktop Aero experience from 2.0 to 2.8."
2,Amazing,Whedon does it again!!! Loved the blog. Neal Patrick Harris gives an awesome performance and I just love Nathan Fillion. Kudos to all! I'm hoping now for a series!
2,One of the BEST HOSRE movies ever made!,I'm one of those people who watch every horse movie that comes along!And I have probly seen them all!Hidalgo is for HORSELOVERS! And for people who does not understand the strength and determination a horse carrys. After watching this movie it makes you think about all the little trail rides you have been on and let me tell you it is nothing compared to what Hidalgo and Frank went through!This is a must see movie for all!
1,owner,#8 socket cracked first time it was used. westocktools refused warrantee saying it was sold to me with no warantee. Buy someone elses.
1,Eau de Campagne by Sisley,This is simply overwhelming! Too much greenery for me & my allergies. If you like a very strong perfume and allergies are not a problem you may like this perfume.I tried to give this away & NO ONE would take it! Beware.
2,El mejor estudio en profundidad sobre Matsuo Basho,"Un verdadero estudio en profundidad sobre este genio de la literatura universal, quizá el único, escrito por un gran especialista en la vida y la obra de Basho. Imprescindible para los que quieran adentrarse en todas las claves del hayku."
2,"Scary , good book!",This is a great book with lots of scary stories. I read it really fast because it was really scary. I just couldn't set it down! Devra Speregen is a great author and you should read some of her other books. The only bad thing about this book is that it was too short.
1,Undemanding,"This is a workmanlike historical thriller. A fair amount of effort has been put into the setting, and the book is a reasonable page turner - but it has some important flaws.As a work of literature the book has serious faults. The plot and character development are both extremely one dimensional - the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad beyond belief. Neither learn anything or develop much throughout the course of the book. If this isn't a problem for you, then you should love this book. Otherwise, these elements are likely to overcome the good stuff in the book and become frustrating."
2,I love these,"I have a problem buying shoes or boots due to back problems. Went shopping for winter boots and $130.00 boots were so uncomfortable..I remembered my childhood and found these, they are great just put on over my comfortable shoes and I'm ready for the weather outside."
2,It's a horrible shame that this is out of print...,"... or it would be another of the books on my permanent gift-giving list.Reading this book is like rummaging through the proverbial attic. It's full of dusty, shabby notions that seem dated, broken, and discredited; what seemed enlightened in 1920 is disturbingly racist now, for example, and the veiled denunciations of Aleister Crowley are valuable only as historical curiosities.But in the dusty clutter, there are occasional treasures of inestimable value. Dion Fortune expressed, possibly better than any writer I've ever encountered, the extent to which mystical experience relies on the tension between the literal and the metaphorical. Buried in the middle of this book is an allegorical passage as deep and expressive as Plato's cave.If you can find this anywhere, it's worth the search."
1,No good quality,The lamp came with missing lock nut to hold one of the shades. Called the customer service center for hunter lighting and they in a condescendingly agreed to send a replacement. The replacement wasn't fitting well either.The positive thing is it is cheaper than getting it from a store like Rooms to Go etc.
2,Classical Disnet,"I grew up with these classics from Disney. Great family entertainment at it's best! - especially for cat lovers. TC really shows his lovable, yet independent and curious personality. Teenagers and young adults may find the special effects outdated, but if they can get beyond that, they will still find the story entertaining and fun to watch."
2,Every handyman needs some heat shrink tubing!,Use it instead of black tape to make a more professional wire splicing job. Just heat it with a hair dryer for a nice looking splice! I highly recommend you get some today!
2,TSD m9 CO2,Shipped quickly and well packaged to prevent damage. Although I haven't fired this weapon yet it has a solid feel and weight to it. The one thing I did notice was that it does not fit a Safariland holster well. Compared to my real steel weapon its wider at the pistol grip. It does however fit a blackhawk sportster holster just fine.
1,Trying to make a quick buck or just poorly researched?,"While I am a huge fan of DMB and most everything that has to do with one of the most talented bands in the world today, this book was not a typical DMB experience. There were many mistakes in the book and it offered very little new material from the well written ""Step Into The Light"" by Morgan Delancey. I hope this author was not after a quick buck from the extremely succesful DMB"
1,Kind of B movie,"Or better a kind of a B Computerized Movie.Claustrophobic because the location is a space base ...no more claustrophobic: is a space cryogenic prison (and not too much to spend on sets).Not as 'positively' claustrophobic like in Alien to be clear.My expectations weren't high and this is below that.A movie to watch in a boring sunday afternoon, nothing more epic then this."
2,One of the great westerns,"This ground breaking film depicts the true feelings of the West and the desperate men who were outlaws. The cinematography is excellent, with a stunning opening and closing sequence. The slow motion depiction of the final battle is mind bending in its suggestion of comradeship amongst the gang. The close ups are tremendous and the casting of Wm Holden was inspired, also Robert Ryan as the pursuer."
2,Love this CD!,I love Celtic music and this does not disappoint. it transports you back to Ireland and another time and place. So soothing and yet uplifting at the same time. This is music for the Irish soul.
2,The Best Book,I thought Gathering Blue was a great book! When I read it I just couldn't wait to turn to the next page. If you really like exciting books you will love Gathering Blue.
2,Andre Rieu - good as ever,"I just can't help toe tapping to this man's music. Both he and his orchestra just seem to enjoy their music so much it is impossible not to join in, Is it possible that he will ever come to New Zealand do you think? I'd even fly to Australia to attend one of his concerts!"
1,Continued obfuscation by big industry,"While healthy debate about global issues is important, this film is quite clearly lobsided and continues to blur the public debate on the issue of global climate change. It makes the absurd claim that most climate scientists are sell-outs (protecting their own careers) but that the naysayers are free from bias (despite being funded by big energy companies). Worse yet, they toss out the cautionary principle - suggesting that a move towards alternative energy is a way to keep developing nations poor. While the world powers may want to keep a segment of the world's population poor, I don't think they are inventing human-influenced global warming to carry out that agenda. It simply doesn't pass the smell test. Save your skepticism for this video, not the debate over global climate change (which should be ended by now)."
2,Kicker hits hard,"This is an awesome sub, hits really hard. It's way better than most subs for the price. I got two of these on 1000 rms."
1,No denial,"I wasn't pleased with this product. In my honest opinion, it should be included with another purchase at a deep discount or a freebie."
2,"Great boppers, jivers and strollers","This is a great dance album with plenty boppers, jivers and strollers. If you like to jive get this cd and any other 50's McNeely or Joe Houston. A great uptempo cd full of great songs and honking saxaphone. Pre pleasurable r&b."
1,not purposeful,"NP, unlike Kitchen, is an awful mass of banal dialogue centered around a bewitched story by a fallen author. The four lives, really six, have nothing better to do than pity their own sorry selves. NP goes nowhere."
1,Lighted Lumenok,Don't buy this unless your crossbow takes flat lumenok. The picture is totally wrong. I ordered by just looking at the picture. Buyer bewared. I can't totally fault myself. Amazon should have the correct picture of their product. So make sure your crossbow takes flat lumenok.
1,Took too long,"It's great ordering a book, and the book was good, but the delivery took so long that I had to go to the bookstore and get it for my daughters class anyway, so it was really a waste. Shouldn't take over two weeks to get a book."
2,Regarding the jar,FYI the kitchenaid live chat person just said that they are NOT making the jars out of polycarbonate anymore. I gave them the model and serial # and they are sending a free replacement.
2,"Great--lots of pieces, low price",This was a great starter set for my girls' kitchen. It has just about everything needed and it is very cute. And all for a great price.
1,An incredible piece of Dreck.,"This has been one of the most unintelligable pieces of sci-fi written, As a flight of fancy that builds and extropolates on where science may take us, it is totally lacking. As a universe of its own merit from which to examine issues that pertain to life and how we live or the choices we have before us as a society, again lacking. An immense waste of time, money and energy. It made me question only the taste of the person who recomended this dreck."
1,DON'T READ THE GIVER,IT IS ABOUT A KID NAMED JONAS AND AN OLD GUY WHO GIVES JONAS BAD MEMORIES. THE ENDING IS SO WEIRD. THE BOOK MAKES YOU THINK TOO HARD. IT IS BAD.
1,2 damaged units,"I wish I could recommend this unit but both samples I received from Amazon were damaged. The second was worse than the first due to a broken motor mount. I really wasn't looking for another repair project especially on a brand new product. Amazon issued a refund without any issue. I'm very impressed with Amazon customer service, they are first rate. It seems silly for the manufacturer not to modify the packaging after 3 years of complaints about shipping damage. This has got to be costing them some serious money replacing or scrapping these units."
2,Runs a little big,"This is a great belt. It runs a little big, though, so if you're planning to wear it high on your waist you might consider a smaller size. I wear a large and bought the M/L, and had to punch another hole. Otherwise, and nice, well-made belt."
1,BAD,"Your Hair Feels like ruber (if u like that this is the product for you) I recomend Kusco and Murphy ""Beach Hair"" , That is Great but it is not sold on amazon ."
2,Rarely does this happen!,"Rarely does a hugely epic rock band like Genesis have there lead singer quit, only to have that band release one of their greatest albums post the lead singers departure. A Trick of the Tail is nothing short of a masterpiece. The critics foolishly predicted the bands demise once Gabriel stepped out of the fold. This is an album that requires multiple listens, Its technical but still accsessible. Collins vocals are strong and quite gabriel like, This is definatly a progressive rock album closer to there original style of writing and playing. I will not go into detail over every song due to the fact that so many have already written about that. I will just say one more thing, I to prefer the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis, However, it would be unwise to dismiss all the great work the band put out after gabriel left, and this is a prime example of that point. Actually I prefer this album way more over Gabriels first solo album."

2,I never laughed so hard in my entire life!!!!!!!,"I love Daphne & Celeste, they're the best!! Their songs are bubbly and fun. The only serious track is ""Hey Boy""; the girls are fighting over a boy, the bridge is cool: ""talk to the hand cuz the face aint listening, cuz i'm hot girl and you're not girl..."" This album has no boundaries; it's almost as if each song is made up on the spot, but obviously thats not true. It takes a lot of time and effort to make an album, and Daphne & Celeste do a pretty good job of it.I don't know where they've disappeared to. Their last single was a cover by Alice Cooper called ""School's Out"". Since then, there has been no new songs or anything that has to do with Daphne & Celeste. I read somewhere that their next single will be called ""P.A.R.T.Y."", but we will find out if thats true.Daphne & Celeste, if you're reading this, please show yourselves cuz you are AWESOME and no one can ever be as good as you, and thats a fact!"
1,I HATE IT!,"Unless you want Extremely small cookies, don't by this product. The metal is some cheap arrangement of non-identifiable shapes that bend easily. NOT a good product."
2,Fraggles ROCK!,"What's not to love about the Fraggles? Putting this DVD in is like visiting with old friends. I love the characters, I love the humor (much of it more suited to old kids rather than young kids), I love the lessons taught. The quality of the DVDs is excellent. For those of us who watched this with our children, to those who never saw the show before...buy it...you'll love it!"
1,Not really worth it,I bought this item thinking it might be made with some quality since the description said it was originally $149. So you can imagine my disappointment when i open the box and the compartment cover doesn't even sit on the hull correctly. I'm not sure this item is worth the $40 I payed for it
1,"Some Okay, Some Out There","Geez, it's shows like this that make it hard for people to take things seriously, when in fact, they should take them seriously, but who would after watching someting like this? There were a few good points, but over all it just made people who believe certain things look like freaking nuts. I can't reommend this one at all."
1,not for Avent bottles,"While the concept overall seems like a good idea, it is not for everyone. If your life is hectic and/or disorganized (like me!), this is not for you, because you need to make sure to boil water and then place the warmer in for 15 minutes (which means remembering to start the whole process 20-30 minutes before you leave the house).The other big thing that I didn't see in any of the reviews was that this does not work for Avent bottles. I tried with a 4 oz bottle but the warmer was too small and there was no way to fit the bottle and warmer in the bag."
2,This is no toy.,"Awesome. Long battery life and powerful. Been using this product for years and I'm completely satisfied. ""It's not 18 volts... it's only 2.4 volts, sounds too wimpy and too expensive"". Wrong. Try it, You'll like it!"
2,Which Edition?,"You'll buy it and read it, of course. Maybe you've already bought a copy. So what possible decisions are left for a serious Harry fan to make?How about this: should you buy this edition or the UK version? The answer is simple: this is the edition to get! Almost everything about the US edition is superior to the UK version: from the typeface (larger, fuller, and clearer) and page layout (ample margins) to the binding (much easier to hold open) and the artwork (the UK edition has none, and the fun fonts used for decrees, letters, and other documents is absent from the UK edition) this edition wins."
1,Dumb and pretty bad.,"What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved. Other than them, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie."
1,Abslutely Horrible,Absolutely the worst comedy routine I have ever witnessed.Beyond stupid.Painful to watch.Irritating to listen to.Why would anyone make such a thing????
2,Songs are in the wrong order. Why?,This here cd's songs is all wrong arranged from how cousin rory wanted it. How come?
1,Broken!,"Recently purchased the Le Creuset Stoneware 12 1/2-by-9 1/2 inch Rectangular Baking Dish for my 23 year old daughter for Christmas. As soon as it arrived in the mail, it was in a million pieces! The only protective shipping material used was a sheet of thin plastic and a box! I'm sure the product itself is okay, however we never got a chance to use it! Don't buy online."
1,Be Advised!,"Be advised. Despite what Amazon states here, this product Will Not Work on a HP 111 Designjet Printer. You need a HP 82 Black Ink cartridge. Unfortunately did not find this out till after package was opened. Which negates a return. Ended up calling HP, who confirmed that yes. The 82 is the proper black cartridge.Would like to add this is why I rated this a one star. Nothing was wrong with the packaging. And as always when dealing with Amazon the product arrived promptly."
2,Classic 80's,"The pairing of Tim Rice with the boys from ABBA is a stunning success. Chess tells the story of love, envy, and thwarted ambition fought out against the backdrop of the Cold War. The characters are both sympathetic and sometimes repelling with everyone working on their own agendas with ""nobody on nobody's side""I have loved Chess since the first time I heard it back in the mid 1980s and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who loves the game, great music and witty lyrics."
2,Alara,"Alara seems to be the same Alara dynasty common with Yoruba History of West Africa and the picture portrayed on this Item revealed where Agbada, a typical Yoruba clothing fashion came from , and still being used to depict a democratic government popularly called Alagbada among the Yorubas. So Alara of Napatan could be something close to Alara of ""Alagbada dynasty"" Agbada is the caommon long robes worn by the Yorubas.Most names mentioned in this item too are very close to Yoruba ancient royal names. Lakuta, Anikantamo, Ejofakunkosu, Amunnimuye, Esegbosusuona, Pakoyi, Orioro, Sasaoroke and so on. Researchers are advised to to visit Yoruba ancient royal names and Oriki in Yoruba lands please !"
1,Nothing special - and identical to Arthur Bryant's!,"First of all, this sauce is really bland, which is disappointing since it's supposed to be ""hot"". It's about as spicy as Heinz ketchup, so if that does it for you, you'll be satisfied. I bought a bottle of this and a bottle of Arthur Bryant's (from their website) and ... it's the very same sauce! Close your eyes and you cannot tell which you're tasting - even the bottles are identical except for the labels! At least the Rendezvous was less expensive. If you're looking for a bottle of spicy BBQ sauce I'd recommend Big Bob Gibson's or Willingham's."
2,Very well done,I first played this game in 2003 and I've been hooked since. It is not excessively difficult but it is not easy either. Different stages with different vehicles and hidden stages with hidden benefits provides hours of gameplay that will keep you entertained.
1,waste of money if you plan to juice,"Its unfortunate. Two day after starting to use it i had to buy a new one. It is way too loud and does not juice properly, the new one i bought yielded over 50% more juice. Spend more money to get quality"
2,Great for the price,"After spending a couple of weeks in Hawaii my kids (ok, and me too) became addicted to shave ice. Upon returning home we ordered this item primarily because of the price and decent reviews. I can tell you we are not disappointed. It actually creates pretty good ""snow"" similar to what you find from a more expensive machine. It does not chop the ice like a snow cone machine does, which is a huge plus. It works well with blocks from the included molds, but I downgraded it one star for it's very slooooow performance using standard ice cubes. If you want something that makes good shave ice without investing $100 or more for a machine, it's hard to go wrong with this."
1,Disappointment,"What a disappointment. We ordered the Traveldock 900 for Christmas for our son's Creative Zen M mp3 player. There are not a lot of these devices on the market for Creative so we were happy to see this one. Unfortunately, when you put the MP3 player on the base it is unstable and actually partially blocks one of the speakers. The sound definitely does not ""fill a room."" Kudo's to Amazon for promptly refunding our money."
1,Pretika Facial Care System,I was very happy with this product and its performance until the battery stopped holding a charge; which was after the 3rd charge.Now it is useless. Until the company corrects the battery problem I would not waste my money purchasing it. Maybe someone needs to recharge the quality control department so they can do their job. What a disappointment.
1,Best if used outdoors,"use this outdoors and get OK pictures. don't use it indoors. i have a hospital-like light in the living room and still, the pictures indoors turned out horribly dark and grainy. hospital lights are bright.. so think about that when you're fixin to purchase one. i regret buying mine, do not buy this product and expect wonderful pictures. INTEL cameras are best if you're looking for cheap ones =) (both the pocket pc and the digital pocket pc. i have both and i love them.)"
1,THE MOVIES ARE GETTING WORSE,WHY DO PEOPLE WATCH THESE THINGS? EVENTUALLY SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE HEART FAILUREAND I THOUGHT JASON OR FREDDY WAS BAD THE MOVIES SINCE THE 80'S ARE GOING WAY BEYOND SCARE WHY DO THE WRITERS HAVE TO SCARE THE LIFE!!! OUT OF PEOPLE
2,"Awesome service, sent right away...highly recomend","Got my book right away. Shipper sent it to me express mail and did not charge me for the extra postage. This was done, because I live in Hawaii and I would not have gotten it in time. Really pleased!!!"
1,One of the most boring books I've ever read,"Being that I am a history buff, I was so excited when I bought this book. I couldn't have been more wrong. Normally, I can finish a book in six hours; this book took me three weeks. I kept falling asleep reading it!There are no characters or a plot, it reads like a term paper--just facts and dates. It vaguely mentions the lives and events of the ordinary people in the year 1000, and it appears that the authors didn't make an effort to even try to make this book interesting.Do yourself a favor and do not buy this book, unless you need help falling asleep."
2,"Great for Glare, Reflection and Brightness",This installed easily but follow the directions to eliminate any air pockets. I had no problem at all installing.
2,Orbit White Bubble Mint Gum,"Orbit White Bubblemint Gum tasted great (just like regular Orbit Bubblemint Gum), but instead of being the ""long, rectangular gum"" in individual wrappers, it was the smaller ""sqaure-shaped"" gum that you pop out of the foil. Hence, you had to chew two pieces to raelly feel like you had a full piece of gum in your mouth. I didn't really notice any difference in whitening of my teeth, but this is definitely my favorite flavor of Orbit!"
2,"Great Movie, great service","Purchased this DVD through Amazon because I was having trouble finding it in big box stores (I guess it's too old). The product arrived in brand new condtion, still in the plastic and it's great! I didn't have any problems with the seller or the condition of the disk."
2,A watered down OLP,"I bought Gravity eagerly when it came out. I was a little worried about Bob Rock being the producer (this being the same guy that ruined Metallica), but I kept an open mind about it. In the end, I've come to the conclusion that this album is a serious let-down. It feels rushed and shallow. I liked the general feel of ""Happiness..."" and the concept of ""Spiritual Machines"". This album, however, just feels like it was made for the radio, and I HATE mainstream radio. There are a couple of good songs on the album (All For You, Not Enough, Somewhere out There), but the rest is just too cliched.While it is a good album on its own merits (on the sheer talent of the band), it just seems like the band was going for mainstream US success more than making great music.Well, at least I wont get as many blank stares when people look through my CDs."
2,Call Me Mrs. Miracle,The DVD came packaged well. The DVD is good quality and plays well. Like having the information about the DVD available inside the case.
2,Great Book!,"This was a great book; it showed how Sun Tzu Liao had to be both politically and militarily successful in his campaigns. The author was also able to put a couple plots into one story. This was helpful because it let you see how the St. Ives compact saw the Capellan Confederation. The battles were also well described and the main characters were not invincible. Although sometimes confusing, I think this book is still one of the better books of the Battletech series."
1,The movie was probably fine...,"...but I couldn't watch it with my family. After purchasing the rental I attached my iPad to my television only to find that it didn't work. Checking online I learned that programming on Amazon Instant Download:""In the case of Apple’s products the restrictions are painfully laughable. On an iOS device you can’t stream (or play via a video adapter) the video from such apps as Amazon Instant Video, the DirecTV iPad app, and HBO Go. The audio stream is fine, but no video.""So, until this silliness is corrected I will stick with Netflix and other services of its ilk."
1,A Low Point,"""The Twelve Tasks of Asterix"", for me personally, was a low point in the Asterix series. This is a story book, and not a graphic story like the others. So, if you are really looking for the graphic books, then don't buy this one.The story is mildly entertaining, but hardly up to the same standards of the comics. Without the graphics, some of the humour is lost, such as the expressions and other details that make the comics so endearing.Except for the most fanatical and hardcore Asterix fans, approach ""The Twelve Tasks"" with caution."
2,"Beginner to Expert, Easy",The pictures and information in this book make it so easy that anyone can do it. It makes it almost impossible for someone not to succeed. All of the Robert Bruce Thompson and Barbara Fritchman Thompson books are good but this latest one excels.
2,happy knee's!,"I purchased 2 sets of knee pads & I gotta tell you- they saved my knees when gardening & my husbands knees when he was laying shingles on the roof! They are light weight & comfy, I definetly recommend them!"
1,Not a thirty dollar game,"The PC game Murder on the Orient Express boasts beautiful graphics, a plot line provided by one of mystery's great authors, and rich narration. Yet these cannot make up for the fact that this is an incredibly boring game. The game is full of mundane tasks (retrieving this or that for someone) that require no real thinking. As another reviewer mentioned, the sequence in the game is off. The order of items and clues is incorrect, further adding to the ease of the game. As far as difficulty, it could be much improved. Game play was only about one week, playing an hour or two a day. While the game is entertaining on some level it is just priced much too high."
1,Disturbing,"This was my first experience with a true ""bodice ripper"" and it will be my last. In the first chapter the heroine kills a man defending herself from attempted rape, runs for her life and ends up with the ""hero"" who then rapes her himself, repeatedly. And I don't mean a case of ""your lips say no but your eyes say yes"", I mean lips, eyes, fists and feet all say no. I didn't make it to chapter two. I skimmed through the rest of the book. I actually found it very disturbing. Millions of copies of this book have been sold? Why?? There was a time when women actually found reading about rape-based relationships appealing?"
2,Furminator Works Great on my Golden Retriever,"The Furminator removes great quantities of what I assume is dead hair from my Golden Retriever, and this is hair that would otherwise end up on the carpet. I like this product."
1,don't buy this,"Don't give any more money to this movie, Seinfeld is already rich enough, too much for his own good. I like the series but it would be wasted money to buy this, spend your money on ""The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition Collector's Gift Set)"" if you already have the extended editions of Fellowship and Two Towers, if you don't buy ""The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended DVD Edition)""."
1,the books in your life - a skipper,This was so bad I would prefer to read the back of a soup can. It looks pretty but it is simply a waste of paper. The writter needs to stick to fluff as wisdom is not what is between the covers of this book.
2,Immediately Useful,"I found this book immediately useful. I say immediately because the recipes presented in this book are succinct and to the point. It has already helped me in several consulting assignments.You don't have to be a die hard believer in all aspects of XP to find this book useful either. If you're a Java developer and you believe in unit testing, this book is worthwhile. It will help you sort through the various tools out there and find the best one for your situation. It will also give you clear explanations and examples of good techniques."
2,Recommended for your listening pleasure,"Just saw them live from the moshpit at the House of Blues in L.A. after listening to this import CD for a while. A really good, heavy 3-piece band with a good future ahead of them. A CD you can listen to start to finish without skipping tracks."
1,This item is not the one pictured and described,"If you want B and Decker CG41 4-in-1 as pictured, described, and commented on here, DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM. The title, image, and description are for a different item than what you will receive.I contacted the seller/shipper, Books...., and they advised the item they are offering is a sandwich maker only, The Everyday Chef Sandwich Maker, and is black and silver, not white.I don't know how Amazon continues to make these kinds of errors. I find myself double-checking all the time to avoid receiving the wrong product and havng to return it. In today's job market, you would think they could find someone to do their job properly."
2,Power beyond your understanding.,"Of the shirt I can say only this: When I wore it, I was able to kick Chuck Norris in the apple sack."
1,Not Shipped or handled properly..plus not what is pictured,This picture makes it appear to have a bronze color to it.. well it came as a black shield with scratches all over it.. not worth the price in my honest opinion..
2,Cat Fancy!,"You don't have to be a cat-fancier to appreciate these stories of love and loss. Each feline in these engrossing short stories serves a unique purpose. Whether acting as catalyst to an impending break-up, or as bait for an attempted kidnapping, the cats in these stories reflect and compliment their humans in a way that sheds light on all of our relationships, both feline and human. Using ""the cat"" as metaphor could easily become a hackneyed literary device, but in de Gramont's clever hands, OF CATS AND MEN manages to escape that particular pitfall. The stories are intriguing, the characters and relationships are multi-dimensional, and the dialog is realistic. This book is an insightful and creative look at modern romantic relationships."
2,"Good Value, a little cheap on the attachments",Overall the air station performs well. My only complaint is the attachment pieces are plastic and do not secure very well to the hose. I think they could have spent a few more dollars and supplied ones that were better made and longer lasting. I guess this is true of most things made today - cut corners wherever possible to stay competitive. I gave it a 4 star since the pump itself seems to perform acceptably.
2,Pam Grier is as Foxy as they come in this classic thriller.,"Pam Grier is super bad as Foxy Brown. She is smart, dangerous and incredibly sexy as she battles evil. Like the bad guys, you too will fall under her spell. Classic 70s camp; cool cars, funky tunes, and lots of attitude."
1,Wake up Universal,"Having watched a friend's copy, I'm relieved that I followed my instincts and did not buy it. It's ok but I'll wait for the box set. Series one was excellent and I'm sure that are many fans of this excellent programme waiting , as I am, to order the complete set. Wake up Universal."
2,"Fun lens, good for the price","Reasonable good crisp photos. Used this lens for game photography, a little ""short"" for the African bush but a nice lens all the same, no complaints."
2,"P.S. Longer letter Later, a book review by Mallory","P.S. Longer Letter Later is a great realistic fiction book by Paula Danziger. It is about a girl, Elizabeth, who's best friend, Tara *Starr, moves away, and the only way she can communicate with her is by e-mail. Elizabeth's parents are very strict about what she does, so she is not able to call Tara *Starr. But when Dad loses his job, he starts going crazy! Will her family be able to stay together? Tara * Starr starts making friends, and hardly ever writes her. Elizabeth is having a hard life. A great story of friendship. I like this book because I think it is very well written, and it really gives you an idea of what Elizabeth is going through. This book is perfect for people who like friendship stories. P.S. Longer Letter Later is a great book to read."
1,2 3/4 stars,"I found out about this book in some magazine (I only read Source, Vibe, Underlined Magazine, Essence, and the magazine with Vivica Foxx and 50 Cent on the cover this month) and I had to go to the bookstore to grab it. Photos like people on the El, Vin Diesel, Crazy Legs, and newspaper outfits make me miss my childhood (minus Vin Diesel, although he's just great eye candy). A few photos seem plain or typical (ex. Treach's photos, the everfamous middle finger shot, and the soccer photos), some were enjoyable for no apparent reason (Spencer 97 Pro Skater, man on bike in South Bronx), and others were completely unique (Usher, Naomi 03 in Da Studio, Karlene & Cindy, ""Do Not""). Overall I enjoyed the book."
2,A wonderful technique to really understand God and the Bible,"The book essentially covers a technique for truly understanding God and the Bible. This is NOT New Age Yoga!. Dr. McIntosh explains the Biblical principles of meditation -- and its importance for those who wish to read the Bible, study the Bible, and then really, really go deep into the Word of God. Dr. McIntosh's perspective is that of a conservative, evangelical Christian teacher. The book is organized into a series of lessons and applications."
1,Awaken the Giant Within,"Just the same old recycled Tony Robbins Crap. All copied from other's work and repackaged. Robbins is all fluff, a Snake Oil Salesman and nothing more."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen!,"I can honestly say that I have never seen a worse movie! I just rented this movie for my fiance and my roommate. We wanted to have a nice relaxing evening with a fair movie. That's really not too much to expect. My roommate got up and left an hour into it after struggling to stay that long. I begged my fiance to continue watching it with me because I just knew that it had to get better. Well, I was wrong. I'm surpised she's not leaving me for somebody who has their head out of their... You see where I'm going here.I beg you. Do not buy or rent this movie. If you do, please come back and write your own honest review. Heck, if you want to copy mine, feel free!Great actor and actresses! Worthless storyline and plot! This movie is a general insult to anyone living. It starts off boring and goes VERY quickly downhill from there."
2,Favorite Yoga Tape,"I LOVE THIS YOGA TAPE. I was the first yoga tape I ever used and is still my favorite, nothing I have found has measured up to this tape. While it does take a few times to get the movements down and some of the positions are harder it gives you something to work towards and after a few weeks I could just listen to the tape and no longer have to watch. I can't say it enough how much I love this tape, in fact I am trying to find it on DVD because my VCR no longer works and I can not find anything that has lived up to this yoga tape so far."
2,The Lost Years of Merlin,This is the best book I have ever read in my life. It is full of action and suspense.
1,didn't work for me,"I ordered a different brand and got this one sent to me. I decided to give it a try anyway. I initially installed the drivers manually from the cd. The software disabled the login feature for my pc (using windows xp). I'm not sure if it disabled anything else. So I uninstalled it and its drivers and reinstalled letting windows do it itself. When working correctly, it picked up the wireless signal pretty good using only the connected antenna. The signal is about 30 ft away through 3 walls. Transfer speed stayed at about 36 Mbps. Signal strength was about 60-70%. After a couple days of use, it crashed my system. My pc wouldn't boot up. It kept freezing when trying to load the pci card. I was getting BIOS errors. So I disconnect the pci card and the pc booted up. Once booted up, I discovered that my antivirus software was messed up. I tried reinstalling the pci card, but it still didn't work. I've sent it off for a refund. The price may be cheap, but so is the product."
2,Need a little excitement...,"...SNAP INTO A SLIM-JIM! Oh yeah! As Macho Man Randy Savage puts it! Hey if this guy and the Ultimate Warrior, Jim Helwig, like it, why not you? It's has the perfect marketing campaign and the colorful red and yellow almost matches the Hulkster's tights! The small size version of these beef links has a good dose of oil. You can practically squeeze out the oil in a stick so I get a napkin and press down on it and you'll be amazed of how much oil goes into your blood veins. But, would I trade that for the beefy taste, HECK NO! Meat-lovers unite! Get your daily dose of MSG and Sodium Nitrate, both which are cancer causing agents! Ye-Haw!"
1,In a word - RUBBISH,I've read a great many books by Hubbard and others on the subjects of Dianetics and Scientology. This author is hopelessly misinformed and off the mark. Read what Hubbard says in one of his many books and then make your own decision. This is poor journalism at best. Scientology is a group that grows by leaps and bounds each year. Why? Because it has useful information that anybody can (and do)use to improve their life and the lives of those around them. And this is a bad thing? Your money would be better spent on a movie
1,poorly made,"Koolatron stopped cooling after 5 uses. Of course, it is not under warranty any longer.Weak fan and poor cooling. Cheap electronics. Overall, just a pooly made cooler.Koolatron told me it was probably the ""chip"". I asked them to send a ""chip"" to me and I would repair it but ehy said, ""no, we don't allow that. Even the authorized repair people instal then incorrectly"".Not worth the cost to ship to a repair facility, have them repair the unit, then ship back.Don't waste yout money on Koolatron."
2,"Great band, awesome CD, future stars.","I heard a couple of STG songs on the radio here in Boston and liked them. So I picked up the album, amazing. It has been a LONG time that I found an album that I could listen to from begining to end. I don't love every song but I find each song brings something different. Favorites are: Le Disko, Rainy Monday & Chemistry of a Car Crash. Also pickup their ""Stripped"" LP to hear some very cool remakes os ""Stripped"" & ""Nothing Compares to You."" Looking forward to ""Season of Poison"" coming out in November."
1,Poor quality and definitely not an instructional video.,"The only thing this video has to do with the saltwater fly fishing is the fact that the instructor(name forgotten thank God)has a fly rod in his hand. Poor camera work, lots of local fish stories, but very little instruction on technique. I viewed this tape twice and felt this is a scam. Save your money and don't buy this one. Apparently Amazon has a very limited selection of videos on fishing instruction. Definitely not a Lefty Kreh video. One star is too high a rating. Can I get my money back"
1,bond is back and is worst than ever.,"This game [is bad]. I think that Goldeneye, The world is not Enough, and Tommorow Never Dies are by far the best of the Bond games. I think that this was not a good idea. The graphics [are bad], the gameplay [is bad], and the multiplayer is even worst. Hopefully the next Bond game will kick this ones fat ... back to the industry to teach the makers a lesson!!!"
2,Nice Saddle cable,"Nice quality sadle cable. Guys, this is a bike seat security cable. It is not intened to protect your bike against theft, just your saddle."
1,A Red Herring!?,"The confoundingly selective content of this book leads me to believe it was written as a disinformation tool to help shift the blame for 911 away from the Bush administration. On the other hand, if you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK with that famous single Magic Bullet (the case for which was made by Mr. Posner in his earlier work, 'Case Closed'), you'll LOVE this book. I give it two stars despite the content because the actual writing is engaging. I give it no more than two stars, however, because it is, in my view, essentially an unconvincing snow job."
2,Great Hold,"I have curly hair, the extra hold holds the curls without the stiff, stickey feel you may get with other sprays."
2,Typing tutor,I was typing at a speed of 15 adjusted words per minute before using this software now my speed is 41.I think this statement speaks for itself.The games are appropriately targeted at increasing speed and accuracy.
1,A dark novel left to wander through a Indians life.,"A story of a man named Abel. His reintroduction to his native life, the rebellion on society, murder, the finding of self, and continued race to find real meaning in life. This is all told through the medium of dreams, visions, and realities making this book very hard to follow or understand the meaning that the author is trying to convey."
1,Ick!,"Dismal and overwrought bio of silent cinema's first Latin lover. Casts Valentino as the victim of scheming women at every turn. Offers no new information, and rehashes lots of unproven allegations, like Rudy worked as a gigolo in NY before his film career. If anyone can recommend a good biography of Valentino, I would love to hear from them."
1,A downer,"If you like depressing books, here's one for you. I should've stopped reading after a few chapters, but I kept expecting it to get better. It didn't. The main character's scarcasm and pessism may seem clever to some; I found her totally unappealing."
1,buy a cheap laptop instead,"I bought this thing trying to carry medical information readily available in my work. I thought it would work with Linux. It does not.It is expensive for the features: it comes with a slower processor than the current pocket pcs, the construction is cheap, the battery can not be replaced, so one is dead, your machine is over.Does anyone want to buy mine?"
1,No music,This CD came and we could not get it to play on any thing....computer or CD player. Do not know why but we sent it back.
2,This is one of the best books ive ever read.,Though the politics are a bit streched the book has very realistic descriptions of space flight.
1,not my thing,"I picked up Life Of Pi because it is such a popular book. I just could not get into it though. I really liked the author's descriptive and straightforward narrative, but the plot/theme was just not for me i guess. Definitely give it a shot, but maybe get it at the library first."
2,Great hair dryer!,"ProsLeaves my long/ wavy/normal-to-fine hair smooth and shinyStrong air flow, but not too strong that it instantly tangles hairThe option for hot air is actually hot without being scaldingThe switches for temperature control and speed don't accidentally switchNice designCuts down drying timeGreat priceConsA little heavier than I'd likeHandle can be a little slippery due to the smooth texture of the dryer- kind of hard to holdThe shaft of the dryer (where the air comes out) is a little longer than I'd likeOverall, I recommend!"
2,A sober elegant performance,"It seems that lately, Glenn Gould has become some sort of de facto bench mark by which Bach keyboard performances are defined. This is a shame because Serkin's performance is an elegant performance. As a previous reviewer had stated, when you listen to Peter Serkin's performance you feel like you are listening to Bach, whereas Gould's performances sounds like you're listening to Glenn Gould. Frankly, I also appreciate the fact that the performer is not humming along in the background. I also appreciate that this he doesn't over embellish or over rubato his performances.Highly recommended along side Angela Hewitt's performance."
2,Good Product. All Windows Compatible,"Its a nice product, inspite of its technical details saying that it is for win 95 , it works on all. its also a quite key keyboard. its Definately more worth for its price"
1,"Silpat is great for candy-making, but not baking","Silpats are wonderful for baking. Peanut brittle, caramel, or anything else that requires a buttered pan works great on a silpat. However, I much prefer parchment paper to silpats when I'm baking. The parchment paper does not mess up the heat distribution, and in my experience, Silpats repel grease more than parchment paper, meaning that when I bake with Silpat, my cookies have more oil left on the bottoms of them (soggy middles) than when I bake on parchment paper. The parchment paper seems to soak up some of the oil, leaving a crispier bottom. Most people probably like Silpats because they're cheaper and easier than parchment paper. I prefer a better product, even if it requires a bit of extra work."
1,No luck with this one,Right out of the box this unit did not work correctly so I had to return it; so frustrating. It would not grab and pull the rivet.
2,Listen here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For a long time iv wanted this game for a long time about three months.I was exited to finnally get it, I understood it uses sunlight to play,I waited two days days to play,all the sunny days in san clmente The sun doesnt come out So I try to play without it because I wanted to play,and......trust me it doesnt work well.You need reeeeeal sunlight which I know.The gameplay isnt good,the graphics are ok.You probably dont want this game unless its constantly sunny.Overall,it isnt great I would not buy.I wasted money you should get sword of mana instead."
2,Awesome movie,"Great movie, I got the SD streaming version and it looked great, no buffering or anything. I highly recommend it."
1,A cry in the wild was too wild for me!,"I am a fifth grader and watched this movie in class. My whole class and I agree that it was graphic. There was lots of blood and nude scenes. I think it should have been a PG-13 rating, and shouldn't be shown in elementary or middle school. It is more violent and bloody than the movies my older brother and my mom watch. It was a MAJOR disappointment."
1,Gaetan,"Islam is not a combination of anything to do with the Bible. If it was, Muslims would be calling Jesus ""God"". You need to separate the Quran from anything Christians or Jews have ever believed to understand true Islam."
2,It's working!,"Dr. Krystosik's book was the key I needed to finally begin to lose weight. It's not a diet, rather it's a change of lifestyle. And a pleasant one at that. I am not hungry and I am seeing numbers on my scale that I haven't seen in years."
1,faulty adapter,"If you have Garmin Legend GPS, do not buy this adapter. I purchased it, used it in the truck and every time you turn off and turn on the engine, it will damage GPS. I had my GPS replaced 3 times.I purchased newer Legend HCx and got it damaged by adapter also. After replacement, I simply use standard cellphone cigarette adapter and haven't had any problem at all."
2,GOOD BOOK!,This is a very interesting book to read! I learned a lot from this book! Goood book!!!! Thank you a lot !
2,Bought this for baby's fingerprints,"This Product arrived late. By then, I had to use a Office Depot ink pad for my baby's fingerprints that were required for a official document.In my opinion, this product is good for fingerprinting. It contains wax which does not cause blotting."
1,Got these for Xmas 2012,"Just got this today. One side of the headphone does not work. I am returning this today with Amazon's great return policy. Read the reviews, buyer beware. Need I say more?"
1,Nice case but the zipper broke.,"Nice case for a good price, but I guess you get what you pay for. Within a week of having the case the zipper broke rendering it useless. I now use the case without the outer shell."
1,Not worth trying,"I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with this hot curler set and have returned it. It is very poorly designed: the curlers don't fit well the heating pegs, but rattle and fall off if even slightly bumped; the lid doesn't stay on; the clips are hard to get onto the curlers; the directions say to preheat for 15 minutes, then leave the curlers in for 15-30 minutes (which defeats the purpose of using hot curlers in the first place!); the ""cool touch"" ends are neither cool enough to touch nor easy to handle; the curler clips left bumps in my hair that lasted longer than the curl; the cord wraps around the base but doesn't fasten, so it keeps coming unwrapped if you move it. Forget it!"
2,A Very Good TURANDOT,"At this very favorable price, give this a try. Everything about it is first-rate, particularly Caballe who really has no problem with the tessitura here and who provides a Turandot with more hidden warmth at first than we are used to (with Nilsson, for instance). The sound is fine too."
2,Took me awhile....,"BadA. The narrative pace is just awful. I don't know what it is about this book I almost didn't make it past the first 40 pages because the begining moves so slowly.B. The idiotic ""conspiracy theory"" idea regarding the Texas Revolution. Someday right minded people everywhere will be able to laugh conspiracy nuts right off the street.GoodThe book has a great deal of information regarding the beginnings of an organized abolitionist movement in this country. Garrison was the focal point for this when the movement started to move beyond isolated groups of idealists and Quakers and started to be taken seriously as a genuine force for social change.Overall-Once you get into the book it is amazing, but you have to be in the right mood to do so."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,The controls are terrible. They didn't do a good port to the PC. I would give it zero stars if I could.
2,Ode to the South,"Elton' s ode to the South proves tempting,evoking Tumbleweed Connection but falling short.One thing he does more is piano playing as he used to in his first albums.There is a positive feel throughout the record, Weight of the World talks about a maturing superstar while Answer in the Sky delves into the spiritual.My favorites,however,are Turn the Lights Out and My Elusive Drug.Although it took a few plays before I began to love it,I consider it inspiring."
1,This is not Jazz. This is not Herbie Hancock. This is nothing at all!,It is incredible how pop-rock has invaded some illuminated minds and made such cool and nonsense sound flow from so privilleged musicians.You'll find a technically great keyboardist here playing sequences and sequences of unimportant sounds with master command of his instrument.This is not the right thing to expect from composer and musician Herbie Hancock.
1,Unfortunately a waste of time and money.,"I was trying to save money, and this boot assembled very well, but it only stayed on the CV Joint end for a few days. I've been an auto and aircraft mechanic and installed the bands around the ends very tightly with perfectly clean surfaces, but the boot is too stiff to flex properly.After spending $24 for the boot, I spent $75 for a new axle (Honda Accord) and installed it, which took the same amount of time as putting on the boot.Nice idea, very poor product."
1,Very disappointed,"After reading all the reviews I purchased this for my boyfriend for his birthday because he's been wanting a pair of wireless headphones for months. I received two headsets and returned both because of extremely poor reception. Laying in bed, 5 feet from the receiver, the headphone volume would inexplicably drop after about 5 minutes of listening. Sometimes turning the TV on and off would fix it. We thought the first set might be defective but then the second set did the exact same thing. Too bad... I'll be looking for another set."
1,"Late, late, late...","DIDN'T COME IN TIME :( VERY SAD. Ended up having to buy it at a local bookstore....waste of time and of money. Once again, :("
2,Captivating!!!!!,"One of king's best so far. I was litteraly sucked into jessie's horrifying world. King kept me up all night, I just couldn't put the book down."
2,Easy to assemble,This was very easy to assemble. There were no screws and everything was assembled by hand. It looks good and is strong enough to hang multiple items on each peg.
1,Two thumbs down,I had ordered this dvd for Christmas. I got it before then which was great but when i went to watch it on Christmas Eve. I found it to be not funny at all. The F word is used by every puppet and the jokes could be altered to be funny. I used to like Jeff Dunham but i'm very disappointed in this dvd. I must say i am not so sure i will want to order his next one that comes out. He might be not be married any more but i have to say when hew as married his stuff was A LOT more funny....and AJ the new puppet reminds me of Chucky. that demented doll from the old movies. I must say this is the first dvd i wish i had known was like this i would not have gotten it. even the extra's are not impressive to me. I must say others might find this funny however i do not and i think he needs a realty check if he is going to continue this career of his.
1,Too Brief,"The Container mapping is the second chapter is good...I read a book for a day and return to book shop for next day. I am looking for books to discuss the whole architecure with e-commerce site. This book just breifly describe each topic, and some difficult topic such as inventory control are missed out intentionally...The author says it is waste of resource, then I would say I waste my money. I pay $50bulks for the book and the content should be much more enriched...MSDN has a very good example there, The Duwich Bookshop, Duwich Online.....Those are the materials that I am looking for....Disappointed"
1,"Good, when it works.","Like many others here, I was looking for a cheap and easy rower. This one seemed to win, so I took the plunge.The good:Assembly was very easy, it is relatively light, and can stand and fold up to minimize floor space when not in use. Computer keeps time and strokes accurately, but I don't really trust the calorie counter.The bad:Seat is pretty hard and uncomfortable. Footstraps are next to useless (take an old pair of sneakers, pull out the insole and drive 3-4 screws through the shoe into the footpad. Replace the insole, lace up, and you'll never slip out again!).The dealbreaker:After only a few months of use, one of the wheels has broken clean in half. It is currently useless as the seat will not move while I'm sitting on it. I'm still looking for a replacement."
2,A book that every one should read. A must for jewish Library,"This is one of the rare documents that describe a corner of so rich and profound Jews History in Persia (Iran). As much this book is probably one of a kind, and so well written, and the writer(s) efforts, has to be recognized; the planning and ideas which originated from its supporting organization (The Center for Iranian Jewish Oral History) which so far has led to production of this book deserves to be recognized much greater. The Persian (Iranian) Jews have brought a rich history with them to western hemisphere. Publication such as this, not only demonstrates their effort in more than 5000 years to survive, thrive, and contribute to the culture and governing system that they lived in, but also can acts as a permanent document to be passed on to their next generation; a generation which is not or so poorly exposed to their past and the history of their ancestors."
2,5 star album,The guy who ran benway bop records in las vegas made me buy this record and i will never be the same. Song after song of completely strange but funny punk rock.thanks ron benway.
1,Underground metal!!!,"OK, so... this is just a good CD. Overall, yes, it can get kind of boring, every song is about the same thing, etc etc. But, hey I can't lie when I tell you that I loved it. The way every song is mixed differently, giving it that everchanging flow, keeping it from getting so boring like most metal CDs... I think the vocals could have been mixed a little better, but overall it wasn't bad."
2,"If you love the show, this is a must buy!","if your looking for a reason to buy the book, Just do it! I have read and re-read it and still am not done with it! Its great it includes little things that you would have never known. The cast is shown for who they are in there own personal sportlight. You find everything from there application to there favorites to what there up to now. If you love the show or just wanna be nosy this is the ultimate guide to your curiositys! Just buy it you definitly won't regret it!"
1,Overpriced,"This meter does exactly what it says for about 5X what other meters cost. An excellent product if you are made of money. Its like the $1,000- government toilet seat. For simple volt/amp/continuity measuring save your money. The simplest radio shack, amprobe, or extech meter will work fine."
1,Don't understand the appeal,"I've been a Dr. Who fan since I was a child. I saw ""Trial of a Timelord"" as the dismal cap on a series run from greatness to ruin in a few short years. The ""trial"" plot is cobbled together to salvage the production of three incomplete episodes that were in various stages of completion when the BBC decided to put the show out of its misery. There's no doubt that the best of the Colin Baker era is here, but that is condemning with faint praise. The Sylvester McCoy era is sometimes worse, sometimes much better, but Dr. Who never regained the greatness it had from 1968-1980. I think you have to be a fan to enjoy this at all."
2,Needs a little elbow grease,"I am pretty happy with this pump, especially considering all I had before was a little hand pump. Using the presta valve side, I pumped up to 80psi very quickly. Getting up to 100psi took a LOT of effort. I put all 130lbs of my body weight into it and it was extremely difficult, but I got there. I am ok with this because it's a lot easier than my hand pump. Also, I haven't come across any pumps that go to 100+ psi with ease."
1,Don't waste your money,"Cheaply made. I got it, plugged it in, and it burned out. Opened and found a transistor not even screwed in. Save your money. It wasn't worth the aggravation of returning it. I used it in my RV. I hard wired a wall socket instead. Works much better, and half the price."
1,For women who want to be Stepford Wives,"This book was definitely not for me. I would have appreciated some biblical foundations on where some of these opinions of womanhood come from. Then, maybe would be open to receiving some advice on what materials I should or shouldn't wear to please my husband. I'm all for serving and respecting my husband, but I am not defined by that. I'm defined by who God says I am, not by how much my husband shows affection towards me and loves me. If you are going to put this book into your Spirit, please know that God loves you more than your husband could ever love you, and he will show you by faith in JESUS in the LIVING WORD of GOD (bible), how to love and honor your husband."
1,A (bad) TV movie?,"Interesting premise, but poor execution. Stereotypical characters, meandering psycho-babble, unsatisfying conclusion. Dissappointing read."
1,No fun,"I had read quite a few good reviews about these bikes and was excited to get one. But I found it very disappointing. I read how easy and fun and comfortable it was on 3 or 4 differesnt sites. Not so, it really want all the comfortable and I didn't find it fun for the most part. The steering was kind fun. But over all I wouldn't recomend this type of bike. It's also extreemly slow so don't expect to be able to ride with others who are using a normal bicycle."
1,Very loud,"To it's credit, this dryer is lightweight. The description of this item states it is ""super quiet;"" however, I found it to be quite loud on the high setting. Also, the diffuser attachment hurts my head. Someone needs to tell the folks at Revlon that the human head is spherical--not flat. Finally, the cold shot button takes several seconds before the air temperature drops; it's far quicker and simpler to just turn the dryer away from your hair to set the style. I am not able to see any increase in shine, luster, or smoothness from an ordinary hairdryer without Tourmaline or Ionic technology."
1,You people are stupid!!!,Why do you people even bother? I mean you bought this and expected what? This would be some great record. All you silly people that buy these tribute albums on this website or any other all need to be have your head put on a stick.
1,cswanmom,"I was very excited to receive this DVD due to all of the great reviews. As soon as I received it I put it in for my toddler. After about 10 minutes I turned the t.v. off. It was weird, over stimulating, did not have any kind of order and I felt if I left this on I was just going to dumb down my toddler. Was not impressed and regret the purchase."
2,A Book for Everyone,"This book is great. I normally don't read non-fiction as entertainment but this is definitely the exception. Hillenbrand's terminology is excellent. She uses the everyday ""language"" of a horse person. She explains the ""language"" so that non-horse people will understand yet keeps the explanation from being redundant for readers who are horse people. The movie is also excellent and really stays true to the book. Both the book and the movie are awesome stories of second chances and the power of someone believing in something."
2,Really Cool,"I'm not a die hard Marley fan, but I've been listening to one of his most popular albums for several years. Hearing the songs on this album seemed a little weird the first time around but soon I became used to the remixes and ad-ins. After I heard it a few times it turned into my favorite album. I buy a lot of CD's. This is my favorite in a long while. I also recommend the Jimi Hendrix Blues Album. My favorite song on the Marley album is the one with Lauryn Hill. Also, I like the one with Busta."
2,'The Straight Man' by Russo is Updike's 'Centaur' revisited.,"How is Hank Deveraux, Jr. not George Caldwell? Both are academics teaching in New England. Both have their counterpoint references: Caldwell's is the myth of Chiron, Deveraux his Occam's Razor. And, both men are consumed by conflicts generated from tenacious humor, perceived sexual opportunities, and their familial infrastructures. It works. Richard Russo has captured John Updike's voice from 'The Centaur' which I have missed and enjoyed revisiting. I know I will read Russo's other novels, and urge others to enjoy 'The Straight Man.'"
1,Perhaps I just got a lemon but I preferred my 2.1,"I have found that MOST of my photos with this new 5.1 are NOT very good at all. I MUCH preferred my older A2600 which was a 2.1. The pictures were fabulous with my old camera. I noticed shortly after getting the camera and taking several photos with it that many of my pictures were blurry. I sat and read the manual to ensure that I wasn't doing something wrong. If I do closeup pics, they are very nice, but general photos are most often blurry and horrible. It's incredibly disappointing. If I could just replace my old camera I would except that they don't make it anymore. I used to rave about my old camera, but I am NOT happy with this one at all. I am going to have to send it to the manufacturer to have them check it out and fix it. What a PITA since I bought it brand new!!!!!Good luck to everyone else - I hope you have better luck than I!!!!"
2,Scottish princess and lots of humor,"Loved it in the movie theater. Rendition of old Scotland very good; characters interesting, especially heroines triplet brothers who provide most of comic relief."
2,bbq grill cover,Well worth the extra money...My grill is like another child to me...only the best best best best best best best
2,Good Astronomy,Nice history of telescopes and all associated equipment. He opens the heavens for both amateurs and professionals and makes for easy reading.
1,Seriously?,"Okay... the game itself was fun for the 2-3 hours that I played it. After sometime I realized, where are my trophies? Then I found out there are not trophies for Assassin's Creed! I KNOW! It seems a little harsh to give a game bad rating over a small issues like trophies but, COMON! I do play for trophies because it gives me a sence of accomplishment and lets other players know of my accomplishments. I understand that 10 years ago this stuff didnt exist, it's not 10 years ago. I can't play a game without trophies and for that, Assassin's Creed recieved a bad rating. Now, if youre a player who does not care much for the trophy/achievement system, then based off the 2-3 hours I actually played, I would recommend this game. But if youre looking for trophies, i'd look somewhere else... obviously."
1,This thing is more fickle than a 13 y/o girl.,I didn't try to return this because honestly it wasn't really worth the time. I would buy a different product if I were you. There are plenty of them out there.
2,Nicely Done Recording,"The original recording was a product of the 60's. It is well done musically and the cannons heard in the pieces are synchronized to the musical score, as the composers indicated.The cannons are authentic of the time of the battles and the sound of the firings good. The explanation of how they engineered the microphone setup and fired the cannons is given in commentary as an extra. This is interesting as well.The music itself is well known in the case of Tchailovsky's 1812 Overture. Beethoven's Wellington's Victory is not as well known. It's a lesser Beethoven but still interesting. It's written for popular consumption so lively. In the Beethoven, the different armies, French and English, are separated in the right and left speakers. Their approach, the battle, and the conclusion is indicated in the separate speakers. The battle is between the forces of Wellington and those of Bonaparte in Vittoria, Spain June 21rst, 1813."
2,Satisfied Customer,"The Camera was delivered on time in original manufacturer's package and full factory warrenty. Without shipping charge and sales tax, I have saved over 30% compared to retail price from Best Buy or local retail camera stores. Online shopping via Amazon is the only prudent way to shop"
2,Love this movie,"I bought this movie a long time ago my daughter, then 18 months, loved it and watched it over and over again. She is now four. I thought this was a very cute movie with a good point which is you are family no matter what happens. My daughter watched it over and over and I never had any trouble with her mimicking anything she saw on TV. She also understood the point of the movie, ""Ohana"" no one gets left behind. I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews about this movie but we never had a problem. I plan on letting my next child, due in Feb, watch this movie as well. It doesn't have anyone die in it like a lot of Disney movies even though Lilo's parents are deceased. I thought it was one of the best starter movies of Disney."
1,The Search Is Over,"If you're looking for the worst Gary Numan album, you've found it. It sort of feels like a contractual obligation album of some sort (maybe IRS demanded a follow-up to METAL RHYTHM immediately). The METAL RHYTHM album is actually quite good, but it just doesn't translate well on stage. Or, at least, it didn't this night. Gary sounds bored (flubbing his lines even more than usual), and only the backing vocals seem interested in doing ""Cars"". The version of ""Call Out the Dogs"" keeps it from being a total zero, but I'd make this the last Gary Numan album you pick up."
2,BUY THIS!,"The best rapper out there making some sci-fi beats. Not much can touch this one. Man, Del can rhyme. Pick this one up and you'll be listening to it all the time. It's one of those CD's that you can listen to all the way through and enjoy every minute of it."
1,crap,The only reason I gave this a one star is because it was shipped fast. The hat itself is crap. It was bent so bad that it took serval days to get back in shape plus the the fray on the end was all but ripped nearly off. The tie under neck does not move so impossible to tighten to head and fits all sizes is a joke. Save your money. It was more to ship then the hat costs.
2,great smooth jazz assortment,"The music is from many varied artists and could be considered acid jazz, but it is a great addition to your jazz collection."
1,what a piece of junk !,"This thing is a real piece of junk, it does'nt braid hair at all, it just twists it. And it does'nt even twist correctly! I tried and tried again and I never got a satisfying result. If you're looking for something to braid hair, don't bother buying this thing. Just continue using your own hands. It may be slower but it's less frustrating..."
1,Description Didn't Fit Book,"The book I received had pages that weren't attached to the spine. This isn't a huge deal, but I would have liked to have known this before I bought the book."
1,Do Not Buy This!!!!,I Would Not Recommend Any One To This Product! I Have Order This Product And They Haven't Came In The Mail Its Been For Ever And Still Havent Got Them!
2,Good read,I really enjoyed this book. A little slow at first but picks up well. I found it hard to put down towards the end.
1,Smoking in less than 2 months,"I was so thrilled to get the radio taoster- It looked great in my midcentury kitchen and I loved listening to the radio while I was cooking. However, we have only had the toaster 2 months and it has started smoking every time we use it. I have cleaned out the crumb tray and it seems very clean on the inside- we only use it a couple of times a week. The last toaster I had was one from college, that my roomate paid about $10 for and it lasted nearly 10 years. How could this one be broken so quikly? Im going to bite the bullet and get a Dualit."
1,Useless,"I bought this as a training aid to teach my puppy not to bark at people. He doesn't even pay attention to it. I stood probably 2 feet away and he ignored it. I don't know whether it's simply that he is a puppy and has the attention span of a goldfish or if it really is just a piece of junk. Either way, it didn't work for me."
1,Good and Bad,I won't repeat stuff about the content that many others have said before.My recommendation is to buy Trust and Betrayal seperately and skip Reflections completely.Trust and Betrayal (the first two OVAs) are a must-have for every fan of the Manga or the TV series.Reflection is a jumble of flashbacks and a barely comprehensible story to hold it all together. I wish I had never seen it!
2,Really Good Listen - Excellent Sound,"I can't speak for the CD release, but this was a 1982 concert recorded for radio broadcast by NBC for the NBC Young Adults Network. I actually have a copy of the vinyl that was distributed to radio stations for play over the air, including all the Honda ads that were included as they were the main sponsor of the show. Christine and John McVie, Fleetwood and Stevie Nicks show for this concert as well. The sound is excellent. I recommend this if you are into Bob Welch."
1,Why all the fuss?,Perhaps the most overrated book I have ever read. Holden Caulfield is a slacker. I didn't give a darn what happened to him.Go ahead and read it so you can hold your nose when others start to wax poetic about how they relate to it.
2,Worth it!,"It's creative, dramatic and entertaning. A nice approach on the subject. Good writing and good acting. It's worth keeping in your library."
1,Kind of useless,"This DVD teaches individual steps, but does not put them together for ease of learning any actual dances. So if that's what you're looking for, I'd suggest not wasting your money on it."
1,A Miss For My Favorite Idol,"You might have bought this album because you saw the album cover as a shirt in Hot Topic and thought it looked cool. If that's the case, you should go buy Idol's Greatest Hits instead, because this album only has a few truly great songs on it. ""To Be a Lover"" was the big hit here, but the best track is the six minute long ""Don't Need a Gun"" (which was subsequently trimmed down for radio; this album version is better). Also, this was Idol's follow-up to his uber-successful ""Rebel Yell"" album; ""Whiplash Smile"" seems to go out of its way to be edgier in stark contrast to his previous album. All the songs are OK, but nothing there's not enough to make you say, ""That was AWESOME!"" once you're done with it. Good title, though."
2,Halloween,"Great item, super quality, looks and feels real, I love that is comes with the hat to complete the costume,"
1,Not worth the money,"Our daughter is now 14 weeks old and does not use this anymore but, when she did we had serious issues with her sliding. She would go in it swaddled with one arm free (as suggested by her pediatritian) and I would find her slid down to the bottom with her head between the bumpers. No matter how snug we fit the sides to her she always slid. Needless to say, I quit using it and she was fine without it. If you need to elevate your baby put a phone book under the mattress and save yourself some money."
2,Great Cleaner for the $$$,"We haven't had any trouble from using ours. Nothing has broken.It cleans really well. I can't tell any cleaning difference thanusing the ""rentals"", but at least I know what's been cleaned-upwith it in the past. Pretty simple to use, even with the attachments.We use it about once a month to keep the carpets cleaner. Bought new 3/2009A+++ value @ $150"
1,Waste of money!,pfft. waste of money. i loved it until my screen faded and consequentally went BLACK after 5 months rendering it USELESS.
2,An amusing read in a field of boring instructionals,"Over a decades has passed since I read this book, but it stands out in my memory for being as entertaining as it was informative. Marc's style of writing is easy to read and his books are genuinely amusing. I would suggest them over a lot of others in the field just for the fact that they will hold attention while others will either bore you to sleep or come off as just a lot of macho BS. Marc's gasconades ring true by contrast, and add spice to what otherwise might just be another boring instructional."
1,Geared more towards children through adolescence.,"I was disappointed in the content of this book: very wordy - the font size is way too small - and too lengthy because of that. If they can get through the wordiness, I think that parents would find this more useful for helping their children. No where did I see how shyness and low self-esteem are connected (thousands of adults suffer from both), their causes and solutions."
2,"Great at regenerating, but not on hydration","For those of us with superbly dry skin, this stuff won't touch it. You'll HAVE to use an extra moisturizer with it to hydrate your skin.However, for the regenerating portion, it's quite outstanding. I've been using it on my face for quite some time but about a year-and-a-half ago, I had two moles removed on my upper arm and for some reason, they just wouldn't heal. I've tried about everything and on a whim, I just put this stuff on them for the fun of it. Well, not only did it start the healing process on the scars, it also got rid of a lifetime problem I've had with these little bumps on my arms. Pretty awesome stuff, that's for sure! In addition, I would think that it might work on pregnancy stretch marks too if it's able to mend scars.So, give it a try - who knows? You might be surprised at what it can do for your skin! Recommend!"
2,Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,Norbert Leo Butz is absolutely amazing once again and once again Sheree Renee Scott is a usual disappointment. But one of the bonus tracks she actually sounds alright.
2,DECENT,"IF IT WASN'T FOR MAFIA AND FLUXY ON THE TRACKS, THIS CD WOULD BE PLAIN BORING. THE ARRANGEMENT ON ALL THE SONGS FROM THIS UNDERATED BRIT DUO IS CLASSIC. THE ONE COMPLAINT WITH NON-REGGAE LOVERS IS THAT REGGAGE IS STAGNANT, NO GROWTH. THE BEATS ARE THE SAME. HOWEVER, HERE ON GREGORY'S LATEST ALBUM, MAFIA AND FLUXY PROVES THEM WRONG. ON ""HAVE I SINNED"", WHICH IS THE STAND OUT TRACK ON THIS OPUS, MAFIA AND FLUXY PROVES THAT CURRENT REGGAE CAN BE FRESH AND INNOVATIVE. CHECK OUT THE NEATLY PLACED CHRISTMAS BELL AND THE ADDITIONAL KEYBOARDS IN THE CHORUS. UNFORTUNATELY THE COOL RULER'S VOCAL ARRANGEMENT ON ALL THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM SOUNDS THE SAME ON ALL OF HIS PREVIUOS WORK. STILL A GREAT BUY. COP IT!!! ALSO CHECK OUT MAFIA AND FLUXY'S WORK ON BOB ANDY'S NEW JOINT WHEN IT DROPS. ONE LOVE!!!"
2,Great and humorous travel book,A great book to read and arrived on time and in excellent shape. ThanksTom
2,Great package deal.,It just finished in UK on BBC. Actually very recent. Better quality than new 1st series. They have had time to get kinks out from long layoff of no shows. Good extras (havn't seen them all. Hours of entertainment. No skips. Good qality. Highly recommended.
2,A bawdy canine riot !,"I thought this was going to be some refined story of the Bard through the eyes of his dog. Instead, I got a randy romp of domestic fights and love, told in ""canine Elizebethan"" form. Wow what fun ! Some of the lines Mr Hooker (Bill's dog) I still like to use. This is a fun book"
1,Do this ... then do this...then do this...,"This is another one of those overpriced Course Technology books which are meant for trade schools and community colleges. The approach is simple: Follow the author's instructions by typing in the required commands, press OK or Enter, and verify the results. You won't really understand what you're doing since the explanations are sparse and you won't be able to apply your knowledge to a general situation. You will only know about the concepts as they pertain to the instructions that the author gives but you will certainly not have any idea how to do anything else."
1,Don't like the Comic Version,"I found that I don't like the comic version of Buffy. It's hard to replace SMG, James M., David B., and the rest of the cast as their respective characters. In many ways, the actors made the characters."
2,Reccommended,"Very comfortable shoe. I wear a 12, I ordered a 12 and it fits perfectly. Quality on this shoe is excellent, no stitching errors, no overglue, no marks. Packaging was good and delivery was fast"
1,ONE OF THE WORST FILMS EVER MADE,Since when does superb special effects merit an Oscar. Hollywood is so stereotyped and predictable that it's impossible to enjoy movies these days. The titanic is nothing special (the movie I mean) and was only such a big box office draw because little girls get wet to Leo. End of story.
2,Schriver is Tufte for writers!,"Blew me away! Now, all we need is _Dynamics for Dummies_ because I can't get others to crack open the 600 page binding. This is the definitive book on document design, and covers the harder task of demonstrating that a document is successfully designed. One of the best highly technical books I've ever read. Covers history, modern practice, theory, links to other fields, etc. for lots of writing and communication issues. Slightly politically biased, which is one of the risks of a subjective writing style."
1,Beautifully written,I recommend this book to any one desiring a deeper understanding of God and His love for us who are so beneath Him.
2,Great knife for a boat crewman,"Great knife from Swiss Army. It's a little large for the purpose (probably the ""regular"" size would be better) but it has really useful tools, included the serrated blade, which works best for line-cutting. If Swiss Army ever comes out with the same knife in a ""flick-open"" blade model, that is the only additional thing I'd want!After searching for a ""low volume"" sheath for it, I adapted a small flashlight sheath that didn't make this knofe even bulkier on my belt, as the other knife sheaths did."
1,meh.,The patterns were small and overly simplistic. The techniques weren't anything I couldn't get for free from a Google search. I expected a lot more from this book.
2,Old school synth dude,"I am a fan of the kings of synthmodern music,such as depeche mode Erasure omd Alphaville etc. So i am hard to please when it comes to this kind of music. This album is so good once you hear it youre hooked. I cant get the song messing with love out of my head. Im so glad their is other cool music out their like echo image. They are a great band look forward to more music from them."
1,"Extremely Disappointed, severely damaged product.","YIKES! There hasn't been an item that I have received from amazon.com that has not been EXACTLY as described. However-I was completely, and utterly disappointed when I received my book from THIS seller. The pop up book I received came in a flimsy floppy envelope. When I opened the package I wasn't surprised when I saw that my book no longer resembled anything REMOTLEY as described. Multiple pages had tears, and pop-up sections were completely ripped out of the book. NOTE TO SELF-never purchase a book from this seller ever again! It just might be worth spending an extra $20 dollars on a book that is legit and worth the two and half week wait. Do not, I repeat DO NOT waste your time or money with this seller."
1,nope,"Bought it for a friend, not my type of movie. i prefer uplifting family Christian movies, only got this because a friend wanted it. I never watched it."
2,Very Helpful,"I decided to buy this book AFTER I injured my knee as a result of running... It would've served me much better if I had purchased it a few months earlier. This book helped me to understand what I did wrong and how to avoid doing it again in the future, so it was definately a good use of my money. The author is very easy to understand; there are plenty of illustrations where helpful; and the information appears to be sound."
2,Easy to use,"Not much to say about printer address labels, other than they are easy to use and don't appear to stick in the printer, as past products have been know to do."
1,Deceiving.,"The product itself works great, however the description is very deceiving because it is not the size the description suggests."
2,A Thrilling Ride,"I've never read Michael Prescott before, so this was a pleasant surprise. The characters were interesting and human, the action was fast-paced and pulse-pounding and the dialogue was pitch perfect. A smooth, appropriately grisly thriller that will keep you reading late into the night. Exactly what I hoped for! Recommended for fans of Dean Koontz, Patricia Cornwell and the like."
2,hahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"im 13 and i went to go see this movie with my mom in theaters (bad idea, i know) i was laughing all the way through the movie and was shushed about a dozen times i was grounded for a week afterwards for taking my mom to that ""stupid, innapropriate movie"" but it was worth it, so find time away from your parents and watch this hilaious film(guaranteed 'pee in you pants' funny, i know i did)"
1,Very disappointed.,"Had to send them back - VERY disappointed. The polarization of the circular polarizer was okay - but as you dialed the polarization down, a warm tone seeped into the image. So you either had cool (temp) polarized image, or a non-polarized, warm image. I could only handle it for about 30 mins before I went back inside and removed the filters and put it back in the box. Didn't even try the UV filter."
1,"Girls loved it, but it didn't last.","It just isn't very rugged. Seems it isn't built for the right age group. It would probably last fine for older girls, who are more able to treat things delicately, but... those girls don't play with dolls anymore. Little girls that play with dolls need this kind of thing to be able to handle less nimble hands and fingers that may get a little rougher sometimes. The design is really cute and made it very popular... while it lasted."
1,I am a long time,Horror watcher and collector: I will make this fast as these movies were some of the worst I have ever seen. Deserve none of my time. Speech out of sync. Quality not good at all. This deserves zero but can not give it. Do not waste money as I did. Also Acting pathetic as well as story lines.
2,"Good batteries, excellent price","Batteries came somewhat quickly by USPS and arrived in good condition. Have used one battery recently on vacation and lasted all day with a lot of usage and still had a full charge at the end. A great price as compared to the outrageous OEM cost. Recommend anyone give them a try, you won't be disappointed."
2,very well made bag. But it's too big.,"I bought this bag for a Gitzo 3541 tripod. Although not the largest of tripods, it is of moderate size. The only thing larger in Gitzo are Series four or five tripods, which have a wider top portion. Even under those circumstances, I find the space a bit too generous. Extra space means extra bulk when carrying and the internal slop negates some of the protection that is afforded by the bag. I'm in the process of ordering something that fits my tripod better. I'm going to use this case for compact light-stands, which it seems well suited for. I can fit three Cowboy studio light-stands that fold up on themselves, quite easily. Like I said, it's a well-made case, just not for most tripods. And for the minority of people out there that carry series four or five tripods (or equivalent), I would assume, they have the budget to spend on something more tailor made."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I have read the reviews about how well this works, RIDICULOUS. When I bought the first Kindle, early on, I was surprised how NOT functional the cover was, so sure I am of Amazon and the owner, I wrote and asked for a replacement cover because this was obviously a flawed design. I got no answer, no new cover and NEVER use this one except when i am storing the Kindle for travel. It is worthless as a holder....WORTHLESS."
2,More compliments,"After I bought this book and started following its recommendations, I started getting a lot more compliments on my clothes. The four stars is only because it should probably be updated with new pics, etc. The information is five star, though."
2,Mrs Brightman has a pure cristal voice that transport me.,"I am a fan of Mrs Brightman since I saw her on a TV performance singing, I guess, with Bocelli. She has been blessed with a cristal pure voice that seduce me and make me think I am in Paradise. If that were not enough she is also beautiful. I love her way to arrange the songs, singing first the themes soft and smoothly to finally going through them with all her power in a classical operatic way. This album is a jewel."
1,Not very impressed,"I purchased this beard trimmer because I wanted something with more adjustability than most beard trimmers. The unfortunate part is that if you press the trimmer firmly against your face when you shave like I do, then settings 1-3 will be the same. They will be a setting 1 - the closest. Reason for this is the guard is very flexible and doesn't hold the 2nd and 3rd settings very well. Overall I do not like the weight, I think it is too heavy for what it is. I prefer the weighting of my Norelco G370 and this is still the best all 'round beard trimmer for my money."
2,A timeless page-turner,"Greene's work, although provinvial in the sense that they are terribly British (I don't always get what he is talking about), is a knockout! What great great writing! Really unbeatable travel reading ... don't hesitate..."
2,Tyreik,"My grandson, just loves this DVD. He can sit and watch it over and over. This is a good buy for a toddler."
1,defective. Broken.,I received this item broken. It is hazardous to use. UI want to return it and get a new one.
1,Only for those who have time to spare,"This book is nothing but a time-waster. Characters have no names and the narrator is never clearly stated. The only thing that was clear was the meaning of the title. Other things, like the last chapter, are poorly done and leave saying ""huh, what was i reading?"" ."
2,OXO products are the best,"I just love the OXO products and so does my family. These were purchased as a gift and I liked them so well, I got a set."
2,They were are and will always be CREAM,"One of the most articulate reviews about the Cream Reunion DVD posted anywhere can be found on Amazon by Mr. Packer. He points out that the reason for the reunion is not important, it's all about the music.Since many Cream fans were not around for the original genius and for decades it looked like we could never witness one of the best bands ever, this would be worth any price to own.The beauty of the music is Eric/Jack/Ginger are not going through the motions. The energy level is high, there is fun in their eyes, and with all the health issues Jack Bruce in his 60's still has vocal pipes that can move a mountain.I went down to the crossroads and think I'll stay for awhile.Thanks to a power trio that has made my life fuller."
1,will not play,"Will not play on my brand new Sony Blu ray player. Don't know about content. It was great when I watched it on Cinemax last year, but cannot play in on my player. I'm guessing it has incompatible region code."
1,Deport this Import,"This disc is only $9.99, but don't buy it. Save your money. If you can find another Shangri-Las compilation similar, do so. The selection of songs are great. On the contrary, thumbs down for the audio quality. It is awful. It sounds like someone burned a CD from old vinyl. ""Give Him a Great Big Kiss"" has a ding in it (must have been a skip in the record!!). It's a shame that such great material was produced so inadequately."
2,It's an okay book.,"He told his story of ""want"" for a Harley straight forward. He got his Harley by whatever means he had. He wrote about his rides; good ones and bad, with refreshing candor and humor. I'm not sorry I read this book and would read another cycle adventure by Mr. LaPlante"
2,Sure Fire Crowd Pleaser!,"World Party's music is most often associated with Revolver-era Beatles and psychedelic whimsy. The CD ""Goodie Mob"" (an acronym for ""the Good Die Mostly Over Bull"") finds Kurt Wallinger once again stepping out to deliver an urgent party message. Wallinger has jettisoned social commetary for hands in the air party songs like the title track ""Get Rich to This"", an amusing homage to the Beatles ""Baby, You're a Rich Man"". A knock out, two K.O., rap inferno, ""Goodie Mob"" is a sure crowd pleaser. Listen for Sinead O'Connor's uncredited guest on ""Chain Swang""."
2,just for fun...,"I bought myself a pair of Moon Shoes in college. My roommate did, too. She and I are both petite (5'2"" or less) and near 100 lbs. For us, these worked really well and we had a great time. We even took a few of the bands off to make them less stable/bouncier. Our male roomies were too heavy to participate in the fun (although they tried)...Now that I have kids of my own, I am super excited to see that Moon Shoes are still available. I remember these being a fun way to exercise and annoy my neighbors. (The hard plastic is loud on concrete surfaces.) I am baffled as to how anyone wouldn't be able to figure these out. You just strap them on and walk... Some balance is necessary, but that's the minimum requirement. Maybe they need to approach these as if they were a new pair of rollerskates/rollerblades?Regardless, this is a fun toy that provides some exercise for those willing to put forth a little effort."
1,Teen Silverberg,"Silverberg wrote this when he was 18, and it shows. About 1 to 2 millions of today's SF teen fans could, and probably would have written this storyline better. What saves ""Seed of Earth"" from zero stars are the last 25 - 30 pages, where the story turns into an interesting psychological drama. Four persons, virtually strangers, are forced to live together in a cave. The tensions, the frictions and the insights into their characters are developed quite nicely (albeit with 50's self censorship of certain scenes). Here at least is the seed of the future great master, Robert Silverberg."
2,awesome,"this product shipped really fast and works perfectly,and for those who said this product breaks and gets stuck in the phone they simply did not read their instruction manuals, it shows you how to remove the connections by twisting the plastic inserts up and it pops out with no trouble."
2,Start Your Morning With Creative Ideas,The Norpro Flower and Star shaped pancake/egg rings are a 'fun' way to start the day...especially with children and grandchildren. The kids really love it! I recommend this product!!!
2,Pretty Decent Card,I enjoyed this event alot and I recommend it. My personal oppinion is that it's between a 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 star product. Main event was outstanding.
2,"A must for any married woman that is ""hanging in there"".","I enjoy all of Berg's books. Pull of the Moon is special to me, in that it accurately depicts fellings many married woman have about their not perfect and insenitive husbands. I like that she wrote her husband letters, reminding him of moments that helped her decide to do the things she does. There are something he can hold and read over and over, rather than letting it go in one ear and out the next. I found this book humerous and sweet. Makes you want to go fill up the gas tank and sit on an expressway ramp to anywhere."
2,rolling along,You can't beat the price for this wheelchair. Its great for transporting people in places like wal-mart and target. It is construted for the average person. I used it for a person that weighed 170lbs.. The footrest are made of plastic which is ok as long as you do not put all of your weight on it.
1,"Outdated fashions, not very contemporary","I'm amazed that this book was published in 2004 since the styles in here are more from the 1980s and 90s (oversized silky bows, dull pastels, etc). The fabric rose bouquet, garter, and shoe bows look incredibly tacky. I don't consider myself ultra modern but this book has few things that look similar to many other recent bride and do-it-yourself books. If you are anxious to see what is inside I recommend you check it our from your library, like I did, and not bother purchasing it. Many of the projects in here require sewing knowledge. Of all the projects in the book I would only consider making one (the flower girl basket)."
1,Not as Good as the Book,"If you enjoyed the book, avoid the movie! I bought this movie because, as an employee at store that rents movies, I could buy used DVD's for less than $5. That was $5 poorly spent. The book is so complicated and subtle you have to read it many times to get every tiny scrap out of it. The movie compressed that convoluted and hugely symbolic book into a 2 and a half hour movie. I can think of some more idiotic moves but not many. To someone who likes the book this movie is like taking the Bible (and every single story and backstory in it) and compressing it into a 1 or 2 hour movie. It's just not a good idea.I'm not saying the Golden Compass is anything like the Bible, (don't want to offend any Christians, I myself am Catholic) I'm comparing the sheer volume of content that Hollywood has pared down."
1,Mr.,Ad stated that this unit was HDMI uplink to TV. It is not and has been a hassle getting it hooked up correctly. Contacted the supplier who has been no help.
1,Not worth the money,"Paul Doherty was a much better writer before he started churning out book after book at maximum speed. ""The Horus Killings"" has irritating, ill-defined characters; a weak plot; and no real sense of historical grounding. I can't speak for the accuracy of the history behind this book, but Doherty certainly can't bring Ancient Egypt to life the way he can medieval England.So read some of the early Hugh Corbett novels instead, if you want a more accomplished and interesting book by Doherty."
1,ILLOGICAL AND DULL STORY,"The novel is full of so many inconsistencies and illogical actions that its very hard to appreciate any other aspect. The characters are shallow. Period. The plot's premise has some interest but the author can't seen to focus on the main theme and loses interest (thereby losing the reader). And the motivations of the characters are utterly ridiculous and unbelieveable. I don't mind books in the genre and there are quite a few good ones that can thrill you and lead to some pleasant diversion--this, however, is one of the worse of the genre and doesn't impact you at all."
2,Good Album for an Old NMA fan,"I like this Album, especially the second Disk. Definitely worth the money. The final track, the remix of ""Over the Wire"" is incredible, and worth the price of the Album alone in my opinion. In general, I don't like remixes, but this one is great!!!"
1,"Dr. Neil Baum, Clinical Professor at Tulane Medical School","This is a must-read for anyone considering cosmetic surgery. After reading this book, you will have a greater understanding of the various cosmetic surgical procedures and most importantly, how to select the surgeon who is most capable of performing your procedure. My advice: don't let anyone touch you for a cosmetic procedure without reading this book cover to cover. Your face and body are far too important to make a make a hastey decision.Dr. Neil BaumClinical Associate ProfessorTulane Medical SchoolNew Orleans, LA"
2,SUUNTO T6 Wristop Personal Trainer with Heart Monitor,This watch is a very good product for people who are very serious about establishing and tracking progress against a formal training program. It comes with USB computer cable to interface with training software provided on CD. Plan on spending considerable time learning all the functions (83 page manual). If your primary purpose of getting the watch is to obtain a heart monitor watch there are products for less money and easier to use.
1,Long Delay on ATT order,"Ordered the ATT cell plan to replace my existing plan with another carrier. Should have just gone through the carrier store. Took more than a month to receive the plan, the phones etc, and follow up by Amazon was very poor. I had to initiate all calls and emails, and the phone reps were poor in follow up and language deficiency in communication. I would not go through them again for phone plan purchase, at least not until they get act together. Before this, all Amazon purchases were great. This really put a bad mark on their rep with me."
1,"A Major Disappointment, Unfortunately!","I bought the disc for the Weinberger ""Polka and Fugue,"" a piece I love so much it gives me chills just thinking about it, it entirely transports me to another world where everything is wonderful and grand, I honestly want it to be played at my funeral -- but I find not only this performance but every other selection presented on this album as a complete failure. Yes it truly is sonically spectacular, Yes the orchestra is ultra-transparent throughout due to the amazing recording, but, I am really sorry to say, I find an absolutely ubiquitous consistent lack of darkness or color or mood or swagger. I mean, come on, for crying out loud, The Sorcerer's Apprentice should have you on your feet! Instead, it's just a lot of bumping and thumping. Also, I find the horns totally underwhelming."
1,"Static, Static, Static!","This headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static. The other parties don't hear it, but their voice is constantly zapped by the static, and I'm asking them to repeat themselves. I've compared it with a couple other headsets I've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations. Actually, this headset has static problems ANYWHERE - office, car, out walking, you name it.Do yourself a favor and avoid this one."
1,tv image,"I was disappointed that the DVD picture was a strip across the tv screen with large black margins top and bottom, and did not fill my big screen tv. I checked back on the original ad for the DVD and there was no indication that it was that type of DVD. I know there used to be two kinds of DVD's; I don't know if that is still the case."
1,"Too much hero worship, too little history","The book reads like a college term paper where the author had a requirement to submit x-number of pages. The book is impossible to really get into. There is little narrative and too much hero-worship. Hardly a paragraph goes by with out an ""Undoubtedly, Lewis would have..."", ""Knowing Lewis' character..."" or ""We can only assume that in light of Lewis' commitment...""If that's not bad enough, how many time do we have to hear that, given the detail of Lewis' journal for the pages we have, the missing time periods must be lost for surely Lewis would been consistent in his recordkeeping.This book should be about 30% shorter without the authors distracting ""commentary"""
1,Couldn't set time,The instructions were easy enough but the watch would not respond when I pushed the buttons. It says to hold the 'set' button for 2 seconds and the seconds will begin flashing. Some of the time it did that but the hours would never respond when I hit 'mode'. I worked with it a long time and then finally returned it.
1,Very good except,"I finally received my camera and shot a couple pics at night. Overall, camera produce good result. I notice that there are couple of stuck green pixels always at the same spot. I am returning it soon. I am not paying $500+ for a defective camera. This is really a big disappointment. Only if Kodak did a better QA."
1,Terrible Video Quality,"Story:If you haven't seen the film, it's pretty great overall. Certain aspects like the smoking inside the restaurant cause it to feel dated for me, but overall it's funny and Ryan Reynolds is great.Video Quality:The problem with the blu-ray is that it is among the worst quality blu-ray transfers I have ever seen. I only watch new films on blu-ray at 720p, and even at that resolution a high quality blu-ray looks stunningly different than a standard dvd.The video quality for this blu-ray is awful, instead of the picture being crisply detailed, it's like there's a filter that muddies and softens everything, literally. I would rather watch the DVD transfer than this blu-ray, and this is certainly not worth the additional money over the DVD. If you have any doubt, rent the blu-ray first, and then make your decision. Not a good transfer at all."
2,value for money!!!!,I bought 3 sets of this sheet set. I washed them and used them and they come out softer after every wash.I wish the pillow case were included too.4 stars coz I cant find the matching pillow cases.
1,no book,"does anyone else have trouble receiving orders? Is 3 weeks too long to wait when they say it will be mailed within 4 days, and it is usually 1 to 2. I can't find out per computer if is has even been mailed!"
2,The powerful conclusion to Outsiders vol 3,"After the cliffhanger ending to the third TPB of Outsiders (Wanted), this crossover book is a must-read. The teams' interaction is written effortlessly by both writers, who are clearly relishing the chance to play with each other's toys as it were, using the new dynamics to let both teams shine.Judd Winick is uniquely gifted at writing the human side of superheroes, and this collection features one issue that allows the Outsiders a quiet moment of reflection and mourning. These are the moments that make this series so compelling and Winick one of my favorite writers."
1,"Be suspicious, be very suspicious","Since the publication of the memoir by Time magazine's Robert Blair Kaiser (""Clerical Error"", Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002) we know that Malachi Martin was a seriously twisted individual who became extremely adept at creating false realities. This is putting it mildly: he didn't just tell a few lies, he lived many lies for many years (read Kaiser's book for details on this and more).So any claims made by Martin in his supposedly ""factual"" writings (to which this exorcism volume belongs) cannot be believed unless there is some independent verification. None exists in relation to this book, for reasons which will be obvious to anyone who wastes time (as I did) on this nonsense.If you like ghost stories, and understand that nothing in this book is likely to be true, I suppose you might get a thrill from it. Otherwise forget it."
1,only as an unreliable third backup,Buy only for infrequent use or a third backup media for items you know you can retrieve from another device. Works great until it unpredictably fails utterly. carefully read the negative reviews here. I wish I had. And don't bother either extending the warranty or calling customer service.
2,Looks natural,"I'm very fair and was looking for a product that looked natural and wouldn't streak. I've been using this product for years. The only challenge I have with it is my feet, as any shoes with tight fitting areas will rub off the tan color and make my feet look blotchy."
2,Deep pan allows for plenty of layers...at a good price,"I've always wanted a lasagna pan that would allow for plenty of layers, and this one is just what I was looking for. I was able to make a 4-layer lasagna that turned out just wonderful. On the second day, the servings were easy to cut into neat and even pieces with the spatula that comes with the pan. On the third day, I used the spatula to cut perfectly proportioned servings, wrap them individually in plastic wrap, and put them in the freezer. They are ready to take out as needed, unwrap, pop them onto a plate, and microwave.The pan is surprisingly light weight and yet heavy enough to bake without burning the food. It cleaned up in a flash; no soaking required. I can't see any reason to pay more for a lasagna pan when this one does the job beautifully."
1,Not as described.,"The description for this audio book, lists 14 different stories, on 2 discs. There are only 13 stories, and they are different from the one's advertised. The product information should be changed to describe what will be sent, not what is offered for purchase. If I had known the ""actual"" track listing, I would not have purchased this item through Amazon. Instead, I would have purchased from an actual book store."
1,"unique, but not enjoyable","The sense of smell is a deserving subject. For a lighter and more clever take on it, try Jitterbug Perfume by Tom Robbins. Perfume plods along; much effort is wasted trying to garner sympathy for a completely flat character. As a female reader, I find it a bit annoying that the women who smell the best also happen to be incredibly beautiful."
2,Great Book!,"I used this book in one of my counseling classes, and enjoyed it. It was very informative and easy to understand. It's a keeper!"
2,I don't understand,"I am Allison. I want to be a model. Could you possibly give me a round-trip ticket to visit your agency? I am the person you are looking for. I live in Orange Park, Florida. my number is (904) 635-3125. Glamour shots has pictures of me. You can also contact Nikki Hall @ Barbizon Atlanta, Georgia. Thank you for your prompt attention.good day, allison ""ally"""
2,Good information!,The book shares pertinent information about the importance of light - good light - full spectrum daylight for humans. Am replacing all lighting to daylight throughout the house.
1,Not a very good book.,"I am an historian and a professor of history and I just finished reading this book, and I must say that as usual, Mr. Lewis presents a very simplistic and pro-islamic view of the world. Bernard Lewis is a hack for Turkey, has he ever written one critical thing about Turkey or Islam? How can anyone take him seriously as a historian when he has repeatedly attepmted to excuse the horrendous war crimes of the Young Turks and the early Kemalists regarding the Armenian Genocide, 1915-1922. Imagine a historian claiming that American slavery never existed or that the Jewish Holocoaust never occurred, he/she would be ridiculed not given a seat at Princeton. For a much more balanced view of what Islam is capable of may I reccomend The Burning Tigris by Peter Balakian."
2,Wonderful Book,I got this book several months ago and I have learned so much. I just started at the beginning and followed along with the example exercises. It has given me so much confidence. I would recommend this book to anybody who is struggling with BusinessObjects.
1,several bad parts received,The instructions to put this product together were very difficult to understand. Several hardware parts were missing such as screws and bolts.Two parts were defective. THe main wheel cluncks terribly with each rotation. I am in the process of having the company send me replacements for these non-working parts.
1,"Takes a long time to charge batteries, and is confusing to operate - fails long term","Works great, but takes a long time for batteries to charge, and the operation can be cumbersome and frustrating.It does the job effectively, and comes with TONS of great extras and conversions.UPDATE (4/2011):This product was only used a few times. I recently tried to charge several batteries, including the ones that came with the unit. Only one of the charge slots would work.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It is too expensive for something that fails so quickly."
2,Aidan Of Oren: the Journey Begins,"My kids and I LOVED this series. I would highly recommend buying all 3 before you start reading them. It was pure torment for my kids to have to wait for the next book in the series. And they insisted on rereading the first book before continuing on the to the next. I love the humor, adventure and thoughtful way the main characters were developed and how they interacted with their world and one another. I am also trying to get it set up for the Author to come out to California and visit our school (our budget is REALLY) tight. I've heard his school visits are incredible. He really knows how to inspire kids to read AND write."
2,Fascinating!,"I've only seen the first episode, so my comments are based on that. This is a fascinating look at the history of Christianity, not only the history we are familiar with as Western Christians with roots going back to the Catholic church... but also a history of the Church of the East. Diarmaid MacCulloch is an excellent narrator and makes what could be a very dry subject matter instead very interesting. Great footage as well! I really enjoyed it!"
1,And. . . ?,"I had high hopes for this book at first but as I read they disappeared. I kept waiting for all of the insight described by the other readers. That waiting and anticipating is what made me finish the book. All in all, it just left me sitting there wondering why I had wasted time reading it. There were a couple of amusing parts, but for the most part I just looked forward to the ending."
1,Clueless,"Estrich must have never had an original thought of her own. Mirroring Coulter's style, she displays a lack of creativity and intelligence that is becoming so pervasive in liberal circles. Where Coulter's book excels in documenting her assertions (okay in an inflammatory manner) Estrich never comes close to the detail or logic that Coulter does.Another example of a liberal, who preaches tolerance and acceptance, being completely intolerant and unaccepting of another's views, to the point that she has to pen a book identical to another in order to attempt to make a point. She fails miserably. Don't waste your money even if you subscribe to a liberal ideaology."
1,Beware! Totally exasperating product that failed quickly,"I purchased this Belkin Pivot-Plug Surge Protector product from Amazon less than 3 months ago in late June 2010. A recent power failure during a rain storm (suburb Philadelphia, PA) resulted in the loss of my desktop, Compaq Presario's C-drive requiring the full recovery option of restoring Win XP operating system and all contents of the C-drive, email, software, etc., - the works - contained therein permanently LOST. The sole, important function that this fancy powerstrip is claimed to do FAILED in a matter of months. Intend to take it up with Belkin, but that does not restore the harm that's been done. Horrible!"
1,A Dreadful book,"My abusive ex husband gave me this little nightmare in order to encourage me to be more vapid and submissive for him ( hint.. though the title suggests it, this book is *not* pro-woman ). Amoung other things, it suggests that husbands keep their wives on a ""choke chain"" and that having a career is only something woman with poor self esteem do, because they feel ""threatened"" by Barbie Dolls like Ms. Bird. Lying is encouraged, and negotating is out. Honesty does not figure in Ms. Bird's world, intelligent woman are held in contempt. Kind men are ""weak"".This horrible book ended up in trash can, and after my ex did other various awful, illegal things to others smaller and weaker than himself I will not get into here, we divorced.Whenever I see this book, I am reminded of the destructive mind set of the man who wants a woman to act like this, and wonder why another woman would encourage it."
2,A fun book,"Six girls are going on a sailing vaction. They all have different reasons for going,and all have very different attitudes. An storm strands them all on a deserted island. They must cope with nature and their own tempers and arguments. A fun book."
1,Not the wonderful old version - everything is changed for the worst.,"I loved the original Moosewood cookbook. I had borrowed it from a friend and cooked with it often. When I bought the new version, I was quite surprised at the changes in the recipes. The recipes had lowered the fat and upped the sugar content. That's good you might say - well I didn't know too many fat vegetarians in the 70's. Good fats from eggs butter and cream - satisfy your hunger plus give you good nutrition. Sorry to say these revised recipes are just not as good as the old ones. I am very disappointed in this version. Plus the new photos take out the charm of the book.I do recommend buying the original version used if you can find it."
1,Nothing like Bollywood,"Nothing like you see in Bollywood dance, very slow and the moves weren't that great. Regret that I spend my money in this DVD. This DVD is for elderly women that will like to get in shape."
1,Don't get it,I can't believe I wasted my money I thought it was going to be like all his other shows but this one sucked
2,Goes Beyond all of the Home Runs.....,"In this book, you'll find out that Hank Aaron is not just a home run smasher. Statistics show that he is an excellent all-round player, probably better than most fans make him out to be.On top of being a star, Aaron's story is amazing with all of the racism, discrimination & hate that he went through.After reading this book, you will probably wonder why No. 715 was only SECOND on mastercard's most memorable moments. Also, you may, like me, want Hank to keep the home run record forever. I'd rather have someone who worked hard for it than a hideously overpaid A-Rod, or stuck-up Bonds.Bottom line: get this book if you enjoy sports at all."
2,"Weak themes, but otherwise perfect","The flow and purpose of the music are immaculate. The orchestrations, the melodies, the textures all give a feeling that there are notes not being played that are there all the same. It is a grand soundtrack. Unfortunately, the main theme is not strong enough to warrant the repetitions as it receives. This hurts the score somewhat, for there are so many other ideas present that deserve greater attention."
1,Drama not Action,"I picked this up since there has always been a lot of hype about it in the gaming, comics and online world. It barely held my interest. It is a dark and gloomy story that is more melodrama than anything."
1,Beautiful play ruined by Kino,"This is a beautiful play, excellently acted in a very interesting production. For the price, however, one would expect decent sound if not great sound. But, the entire production is destroyed by the horrible sound - surely the worst of any DVD I have ever purchased. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! At the very least, Kino could have added English subtitles to make up for the poor sound, assuming that the source was not good and therefore they could make few if any improvements. More respect for the consumer is needed, especially for the price. Save your money and buy the Broadway Theater Archive version."
2,The Next Best Thing To A Personal Writing Coach,"After my third client remarked, ""the Boice book is what got me through my dissertation,"" I knew I had to read Professors As Writers. As an academic coach, I work with professors by telephone to accelerate their rate of writing and publishing. In this guide, Boise gives detailed suggestions on how to manage the primary challenge faced by my clients - a lack of external structure to support regular writing. He also addresses the crucial (but often overlooked) issue of how to build social support for academic writing and publishing. Academics who have wished their appointments came with a set of clear instructions on how to write easily and productively will appreciate what Boise offers in this book."
2,Peterson's is better,This one comes in second. It's definitely for the amateur and is very nicely illustrated. My main beef is it requires too much page flipping and the organization is poor. The one I prefer in the field is Peterson's. It's more pocket sized and quicker for reference use.
1,impressive,"i have never had such a kind of idea that male bodies could be that attractive to me. Of course, i'm not a gay, but i really appreciate the cool feature of those guys--sexy, impressive and healthy! I'm working out regularly, and probably i will be ""the playgirl's man of the year"" some day in the future. Thank you --editors and photograph designers, thank you for providing us such great video."
2,One of the best books ever written,This book gives a detailed picture of Qing Dynasty which ruled China from 1644-1912. It also tells the creation of the mighty empire and how it end feudalism in China. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Chinese history.
2,nice show,"I had seen this before, and I wanted to give my children a chance to see it. They loved it. A fun, feel-good movie."
2,Motivational Interviewing Preparing People to Change Addictive Behavior,"This book was written for the professional therapist, but I believe it can be helpful for the person with an alcoholic family member. It debunks the characterization of the addicted patient as highly resistant and describes how to identify and work with resistance that exists to promote change. I think the recommendations can be adapted to interactions with a family member or friend who suffers from addiction. A caveat, however: I think it would take a lot of effort and practice to successfully apply these principles in the non-clinical setting."
1,Power Troubles,"It works fine as long as it's not attached to the printer. It installs in windows as ""usb 2.0 printing"" followed by ""no printer attached."" But when attached to the printer it loses its mind and starts disconnecting and reconnecting rapidly. Usually this means the device isn't getting enough power so I stuck it on a powered usb hub. Didn't help. It may have been my specific printer and it would have no problems with another printer, but I'll never know. I'm returning it and getting a slightly more expensive one. Keeping my fingers crossed. BTW, my printer is an ALPS MD-5000 in case that's what you have."
2,Sneaks Up On You,"I did not expect to enjoy this series so much. A fat chef as a detective? Please! I'm now hooked, of course. The plotting and character development are excellent, and I've pre-ordered the next season! Other reviewers will tell you the plots and list the characters. It's their growth that I enjoy, and the development of their relationships. This is adult television, and allows you to be an intelligent observer rather than insulting that part of you."
2,"THE 1, THE ULTIMATE, KONIG WOLF!!!!!","ok, i have more than 20 zoids and i dont have a favorite, but if i did, this would b 1 of them! its so kool, its not easy, but its not really hard either. it has a really kool scope that flips over its eyes for long range shooting with it 2 back guns.the konig wolf has so many differant stances too! its tail can be moved up and down alot, and so can its head and neck, cuz they move seperatly.alot of ppl say it has bad weapons and only guns, but it aint true. it also has its razor sharp claws and teeth. its really kool if u like gundam models 2. i took a level 8 zaku 2 and made it ride on the bak of the K wolf holding the scope like reigns, making it charge into battle. and last but not least, it has a reall working fan on its bak. i give this zoid a 12 out of 5!"
2,"Love these, but 2 is very thin. Get 3 for skiing.","I love these Patagonia bottoms, especially as a base layer for skiing. But the 2 is too thin, in my opinion, so go with at least the 3. Even the 3 is thin, but you don't want too much warmth when you'll be active. If you are not planning on being active, then you likely want even warmer than 3.For skiing in the Pacific Northwest, the Capilene 3 has been perfect for me."
2,Ear plugs not E.A.R plugs,"These ear plugs are not the classic E.A.R. yellow ear plugs. The information provided is a bit deceptive. They work ok, but are not as comfortable. If you want the classic yellow, look for an add that says classic yellow and good luck."
1,Mr. Gurdjieff disowned this one...,"Actually, I didn't read this book. Mr. Gurdjieff advised against doing so and apologized to those who already had. Apparently, his plans changed and his writing skills increased so he decided that it wasn't worth looking at. There's nothing in it that's ""bad"" or that will send you down the ""false path"" (or maybe it will, actually), mind you. But it seems that if you're really interested in trying to understand Gurdjieff's ideas or just trying to understand in general then you're just wasting valuable time with this one. Via con Dios."
1,not worth a penny,"software worked great until the website went down that sends the ringtones to your phone, could never get a hold of customer service, so much easier to download free apps online"
2,Very good,Fast shipping good product wont esitate too bye again...but theres a lack of precision the controler was not the same as on the picture it european with the blue logo not red logo but its working very good .
2,"OXO Good Grips 6-Piece Measuring Cup Set, Black",This is a great set that can be used not only at home kitchen but great to use at work. The measurements are acurate and they don't break.
1,ironing board cover,"i ordered this product as I have a Homz wall hung ironing board. I measured the board and the cover was supposedly the one that would fit. However, it did not fit. It was too short and because it was elastized, i couldn't stretch it to the end./ The return policy from this supplier was complex. It said you could not get a refund if you opened the package. Don't know how you are supposed to try this cover without opening the package plus they would charge you a repacking fee.I will not recommend this supplier and will not order from them again."
2,High quality ricer,"This was a gift for my sister-in-law. She was thrilled with it! It has a nice long handle, which was what she was looking for, and it is a nice size and has a nice feel, as do many Good Grips products."
1,disgusting,"What else could you expect from a self-righteous, holier-than-thou, wannabe T.V. evangelist? Is bunk, and I laugh at the very notion that any level of course study, let alone a top level grad course would use this waste of paper as anything more than a quick laugh."
2,"Sexy, groovy, and well produced.. What more can you ask for?","A great remixed version of the original CD. The quality of the remixes here is superb !!! You will find elements of HOUSE, TRIP-HOP, DRUM N' BASS, and BREAKS all wrapped inside an incredibly sexy voice. You don't come across this kind of quality very often. Your lounge/downtempo collection needs this CD. Get it !Please note that the only reason I gave this CD 4 stars (and not 5) is the fact that I liked the original version better than this remixed one."
2,Flute Fantasies,"HelloIf you're wanting to know the content of this CD then I'll go straight ahead. Grovlez, Gaubert, Enesco, Sancan, Taffanel, Busser, Ganne, and the most spectacular: Faure. My favourite piece on this Digital CD would have to be Fantasie by Faure as I frequently play it myself. This collection of marvelous French flute pieces is spectacular and I thourgly enjoy listening to itSusan Milan has the most amazing soft playing, but can also be very strong. Her vibrato is the most immense I've ever heard. And Ian Brown, well where do I start? The guy's a genius. The way he ticles the keys giving off a smooth and delicate sound, always in time.This is a definite 5 star ratingIt's a wonderful CD to listen to whist going to sleep which slowly sends you off into an amazing dream, hence the name ""Fantasie""I thorouly recomend it, Stephen O'Donnell"
2,great for insect bites!!!,I've used this ointment for years for any type of insect bites to stop itch and/or stinging.When I could no longer find this in the stores I went to Amazon.com.
1,Make sure you check for firmware upgrades,"Right now this product does not have a ""resume"" feature, which to me is a must for an MP3 player unless you only listen to short songs - and don't listen to spoken-word programs or books-via-MP3."
2,Amazing!,"Having recently starting a new health regimen including walking, I grew tired of my old pedometer (a cheap unit that I picked up at a sporting goods store for $10) and wanted something easier to set, as well as be able to notate progress. I had heard about a pedometer that had a USB port and set out to find it----the Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer! As a test, I calibrated it against my old pedometer and a GPS unit and found it to be on par with my GPS unit. This unit smokes my old pedometer. The accompanying software is great for tracking your progress. I now vary my treks without worrying about whether my distance or steps will be accurate. If they ever build a pedometer with a GPS, I'll buy it in a heartbeat."
2,Jealous much?,"Everyone at the beach was jealous that I could literally sit and float and my ""drink"" had it's own little spot!! Use it in Lake Michigan with lots of waves and had absolutely no problem with the bottom falling off or seams coming apart!! I do have to say that I bought 2 and could only use 1 because back seam had about a 24 inch rip in it, but was returned without any problems...thank you Amazon!"
2,Make Over Your Man: The Woman's Guide to Dressing Any Man,"I love this book! For the longest time, I have been wanting to make over my man....thanks to Lloyd, now I can!Naima"
1,Oh my word,"Wow...That's all I can say. I haven't laughed this hard in a very long time. As a ""card carrying grobanite"" At first I was appalled by the idea, and then when I listened to the samples I honestly just LAUGHED!!! and laughed VERY HARD! Maybe these guys would be good if it wasn't Josh Groban's music, but probably not. The voice QUALITY isn't as good as the orriginal.... My advice, buy the real thing. Josh is currently alive, well, getting grounded, on tour and only 23. My question to you is why waste your money if you can get the real thing? (Especially if the tribute would make Josh flip in the grave, if he was dead)"
1,I prefer CA diaries,"Ann M. Martin seems to know a lot more about teenagers in California than she does in the BSC. Dances in the 8th grade are nothing like the BSC's. Also, Mary Anne and Logan have been going out for TEN YEARS NOW! And they've only broken up once. I used to be an avid BSC fan, but it got pretty stupid. Now I read the CA diaries and I love it. The early BSC books were great...but not really anymore I think."
1,I would give it a ZERO if I could....horrible!!!!,"I read and re-read reviews before buying, so I believed the positive reviews this camera got. DON'T believe them! This camera has been the worst camera I have ever used. When digitals first came out we got a Kodak and loved it. Thinking we needed to ""upgrade"" we got the Coopix. The pictures are almost always fuzzy and out of focus. The flash is beyond slow. The information that came with the camera is useless. We tried every different setting on the camera and STILL the camera falls short of even what a disposable camera can do. I hate this camera! I can't tell you how many memorable moments were lost because of this piece of garbage."
1,solitaire hand held electronic arcade game,We were not very happy with this game as it does not light up. I have never ever bought one of these that did not light up for playing in a dark space it was not worth the money or freight and handling charges I had to pay would have been better off buying it at the drup store or toy store
1,Perry Mason 50th Anniversary dvd,"Perry Mason 50th Anniversary EditionThis is not the Perry Mason DVD I was waiting for. I expected Season Three Vol. 1. I have spent good money on starting my collection of all 9 seasons of the Perry Mason television series. I grew up watching Perry Mason from the very first season. I am not going to buy this edition. I will eventually get the shows from the 50th Anniversay DVD when they are released in the season's Collection. I would also like to see Perry Mason released in full seasons. Stop this Season Two, Volume one bit. Release the full season in one package and be done with it. I also believe the studios are charging too high of a price as compared to some other tv series."
1,The worst cell phone ever,"We've had this phone for seven months now. After countless trips to the Verizon store, we just got a replacement for the original phone that died. The replacement has all the same problems - bad charger connection, short battery life, dropped calls. And the Verizon Tech Support tried to convince us that all the problems with this phone are our fault. I'm totally disappointed in this phone and in Verizon. Can't wait for my contract to expire, so I can change providers.ps. I also have a Nokia and I love it. Simple, user-friendly, durable."
1,Read the fine print,"I ordered this product for my Pre-K classroom, however I failed to read the fine print which states ""Content developed exclusivley for Comfy Keyboard."" In other words, the product can only be used with their specialty keyboard. This might be a great product, but I don't know b/c I can't turn it on."
1,So much potential...so many problems,"These headphones have the potential to be the only pair you will ever need to workout in. I was falling in love! But, they fail too early and often.Easy to pair up, volume controls are touch, answer calls, pause, fast forward, comfortable in the ears, it has it all.But...The volume controls stopped working after the first 2 weeks. If you look around, this is a common problem.Also, it skips like mad. Nothing will make you want to chuck these in the trash more than being in the middle of a workout and the volume doesnt respond, and the music skips more than a CD.Bottom line?Wait for the second generation S9."
1,Marketing masterpiece for collectors only.,"In what was no doubt conceived by some marketing whiz somewhere, one single was split across three discs, each with three tracks. Each starts with the title track,then adds two more. And grand total, exactly two tracks were not previously released.This is the first part, containing the full version of the superb (if a bit overlong) ""We're In This Together"". Added to this are two extra tracks, both originally on ""The Fragile"" LP (vinyl) release: ""10 Miles High"" builds nicely, but never really goes anywhere (although I suspect it may have done better in sequence on the record). ""The New Flesh"" is essentially several minutes of industrial noise and brief vocals.Is this really worth it? Not really, neither of the other tracks are really much to write home about. For completionists only."
1,+,"weakThe best product reviews include: •An explanation for what you liked or disliked about the product•Product pros and cons•Facts and feature details•Comparisons to similar productsFor more information, please visit our Customer Review guidelines."
2,Not Bad,"I've been listening to T since back in the day. Teena's voice is just as fresh as ever. It's nice to see that she's a happy woman and content with life and love. You can tell this in her music and voice. This CD is jazzy and smooth but I much prefer and miss the young Teena going through the growing pains and complexities of live and love in her earlier albums. I really miss the belting, soulful and sultry deeply passionate songs like Cassanova Brown, Yes Indeed, Dear Lover, Tune in Tomorrow, Miracles Need Wings to Fly, Where's California. This CD is more easy listening and not bad but not her best."
1,What?,"Okay, first of all, I like seahorses. And I wan't to learn more about them, but this toy seahorse is not of much use to a thirteen-year-old hopeful writer.... Zachary B., 7th grade"
1,Deflated,"The product arrived with a hole we could not find. We bought this with several other toys for a pool party we were throwing. The adults eventually laid it out on the patio and used it to sit on so their swimsuits wouldn't snag. I saw in other product reviews that it showed up with a hole, and I took a chance anyway. My bad."
1,"Good build quality, poor mic performance.","Maybe the unit I received is defective, but I have to shout for the mic to pick my voice up. The headset is comfortable and fairly good looking, but the terrible mic makes it a failure. It's cheap for a reason, look elsewhere."
1,Verry happy with the product,I am changing my review. I have an external sound system and when I had that on and the sound of the TV completely off the subtitles/closed caption would show. Once I figured that out I was fine with those two movies. It was my bad. I have seen all the movies and I am very happy with the collection. I am glad that I am able to change this. Sorry for the initial review.
2,An Excellent Value !,"This was part of my Stereo update. My wife and I came from a 25 CD player and thought wouldn't it be nice to load all of our CDs and even have empty slots to grow. The operation is simple, we select shuffle and it's like our own radio station, without the commercials. I matched it up with the Sony STDE197 Receiver and a fresh pair of those Bose 301-V. Years ago I used to be an audiophile and I now think I'm going to enjoy getting back into my hobby."
2,beach-house hot sultry early evening cocktail hour listening,"Extremely ecclectic range of music, all covered in a very laid back fashion with K&D treatment. Particular standouts for me were their work with Bomb the Bass, Aphrodelics and Depeche Mode. Havent listened to the second CD too much but I'm looking forward to getting to know it."
1,Flimsy product from usually reliable Bodum,"Looking at water kettles and reading reviews I decided to ignore the cheapest (which seemed to be plastic-y and not long lasting) and go for a Bodum, as I have used their products in the past. I know $40 is still inexpensive for a water kettle in the US (I dont know why) but I expected more bang for my buck. The Bodum kettle is made of cheap plastic that actually is bendable when heated. The smell in the kettle is of burnt plastic and while it works very well (boils water fast/shuts off/has nice design) I cannot bring myself to drink water from this kettle - would you boil water in a plastic take-away container? That is what it seems like to me. I never expected such cheap quality possible in electric kettles since I have lived in Ireland where every household has one and there are never any as flimsy as this Bodum kettle."
1,OUCH!,"OKAY--I GET IT ALREADY! This is a painfully confusing film with fine performances throughout. If you are bored with the linear and crave complexity with symbols thrown at you for little reason but to further confuse, go for it!! God, I don't care about the characters or the plot in this movie at all. Is it real or is it...? Is it worth the trouble? Maybe, but not for me or my wife, who begged me to stop the movie half way through. Not me--I'm a masochist."
1,"Porn without the um... well, porn.","I just saw this movie and couldn't believe how terrible it is. The plot is so much like the first one that this movie even has a 3-way sex scene like the first was famous for. The film was done so poorly that if you watch carefully you'll notice that right in the middle of the scene shoes suddenly appear on Maya's feet, whereas she had been barefoot only seconds earlier. If an entire cast and crew is too stupid to notice that, then you can just imagine how the rest of the film goes. Also, the whole idea of using rats to sabotage the electrical system in an airplane is too far-fetched to be believed. Avoid this at all costs."
2,super sturdy,"Before I bought this I had a ""contractor grade "" POS I bought from BJS. The hose seems indestructable. It's heavy, but it us supposed to be. I have had it pinch a little if I pull it too much out of the coil, but it is the best quality hose I've ever had. This hose matches the grey exterior of my house which is a plus.."
2,beautiful being is what adam is,"he is an absolutely beautiful person...he's got the charm and unspoilt beauty of a child...if everyone is like him, there'll be no wars."
1,Bose Wave Music System Multi CD Changer,"I paid $800 for the Bose wave Music System/Multi CD Changer. The changer holds 3 CDs. Now the changer will not work and the changer was seldom used. It keeps the CDs and then displays ""Disc Error"" and will not eject the CD. If you put a CD in any of the CD slots in the changer, it keeps the CD and will not eject it. Bose will give you a list of procedures to perform that might correct the problem and at the end states that if they do not work;send the changer back to them and they will repair it for $75 plus shipping. You can try all these remedies numerous times but they will not fix the changer and Bose knows it; they know what the problem is. This problem is common on their CD changers. Bose should be made to compensate/and or fix this problem when a consumer has spent this much money on a sound system/changer. I will never buy from them again. It is a rip off and they are getting by with it."
2,not a country music fan,"But the 'old timey music' on this album bears no relationship to the dreck that comes off the airwaves. The songs are clean and pure, the harmonies amazing. Unsentimental, but full of emotion, each song is a pleasure to hear over and over. The harmonies (on alison krauss's songs in particular) sound fresh and new, and at the same time as if they had existed for a century somewhere in the American consciousness. None of this music seems to have been written, it all grew naturally from some soul plant that ranged over fifty years ago from deep in the Appalachians down to the Louisiana mud."
2,Fascinating Reading,"This book is written for lay people who want to deepen their knowledge of the New Testament and its history. This book presents a much needed perspective, by demonstrating the many instances in which New Testament passages have been altered, either due to error or an intentional effort to conform them to emerging church doctrines. Ultimately, the author demonstrates the fallacy in claiming that the New Testament is an unerring record of the words and beliefs of Jesus."
1,Yuck,"I bought this machine because I love coffee but hate the mess and time that it takes to make it. And, I just happen to love gadgets that are supposed to make your life easier. But true to form this machine by Black & Decker was very loud and poorly constructed. For example, the handle is cheap plastic and I was afraid that it would snap off each time I used the machine. The coffee was nothing to brag about either.If you love poor quality coffee that is made by a cheaply made machine then you won't be disappointed. I am going to try a Senseo and hope for much better results."
1,Exhausting attempts at literary majesty,The opening chapter of the book resulted in my being determind to battle through Ms Forbes confusing and exhausting attempts to cover a range of subjects which demand that the reader expends as much energy on following the plot as the heroine does in her pursuit of the truth. At times the temptation to admit defeat loomed large but the need to know where the book would end was greater. Frustration is not always an emotion which leads one to complete a task but in the case of Bombay Ice it is worth overcoming. Hopefully the next novel from the author will focus less on attempts of literary majesty and more on the telling of the story.
1,Wrong Item,I thought I was getting something completely different. If it sounds to good to be true (price) it usually is.
1,Good for a while...,"I'll keep this short and sweet. It worked for a couple of months but then for some reason, one of the buds (the longer one) decided not to work (the volume is just very low) and now I only have one working earbud that essentially cost me $25."
1,DOA,"Just like the other reviewer, mine did nothing either. I went through three new batteries before giving up. Amazon should set up a test dept. to check all new products before allowing their seller to cheat Amazon's loyal shoppers. These units are produced in Korea (I wonder North or South, LOL). It seems a lot of junk from Korea and China is flooding out markets, same thing at ebay, way too much junk. The reviews on Amazon help a lot when you remember to read them, and please, when you get a bad product right a review. Oh yes, the one star rating is the worst Amazon allows, too bad they don't provide a minus sign!"
2,HP Printer toner cartridge,It was shipped quickly and came as described. No problems with the product.
1,reinstall,"Our first Linksys stopped working after a winter power outage, as well did our neighbors. when we got the replacement we were unable to connect to the listed(168.) url. the install disk provided was usless.we have DSL internet which works fine but we needed this for our wireless laptops.It took me two week of entering and reentering the prividors gateway and all the other numbers.now i finally have wireless what a PINTA if it ever stops working i sure as hell wont buy another one."
1,Not so good.,"I read this book and it is pretty darned strict. I think eliminating foods is all well and good, but I would rather see a book on raw foods that gives me more options, not fewer. It's a complicated and heavy read too. Yes, I want to know more about raw foods, but I want to know about them in layman's terms, not from the voice of one doctor speaking to another. I found the language intimidating and the recipes challenging. Simply put, I didn't like this book."
2,I love a good fairy tale and this series has them all!,"Snow White, Prince Charming, the wicked queen, Rumpelstiltskin, Cinderella, trolls; something to please everyone. However, I hope they don't allow the series to turn into soap opera."
1,The power supply died after one year,"This wine cooler worked okay for a while. The temperature went up after a few months, but that was easily fixed by cleaning the dust out of the filter on the back. Unfortunately, this week the power supply died, and now the cooler doesn't work anymore. It only makes clicking noises when plugged in. I'm not sure if I should buy a new power supply from Vinotemp because this problem seems to be quite common."
2,"Simple, short and sweet","I am not the type of guy that often watch animated movies. I enjoy movies like ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" ""Gladiator,"" ""The Matrix,"" ""The Lord of The Rings,"" to name a few. After I watched ""The Lion King"" I was surprised and was in awe about the story, soundtrack, and the overall feel of the movie. I could not believe that for the first time I enjoyed watching an animated movie. This movie is the epitome of family entertainment captured in a DVD disk. It's one of the many reasons that make a weekend movie viewing with the rest of the people you love worthwhile. It's a phonomenal movie. Two thumbs up."
2,Could have been perfect,"I am not here to comment on the movies, never found The Exorcist anything more than a mediocre flick anyway. I will just comment on this DVD set.The packaging is lovely, with an outer cover made of high quality cardboard and printed perfectly. It houses four individual ultra thin plastic cases, two of which have 2 DVDs each the other two each has one DVD.The only problem I had was that one of the two disks in the first case is a double face disk, and a double face disk means trouble and all the acrobatics needed to touch it or know which face has what! It is beyond me why didn't they make an extra disk and make one of the two single disk cases a double as well?Other than this, I find it to be one of the best value for money DVD sets i have ever bought. A must for fans of those movies or those -like myself- who just wanted to see them to know what the fuss is all about."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH SEASON 2 OF ROCKY & BULLWINKLE,NOT WITH THE CONTENT,THAT WAS GREAT;HOWEVER, WITH THE WAY IT WAS DELIVERED. SONY - WONDER WENT ON THE CHEAP, THEY DOUBLE RECORDED ON EACH DVD. THAT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO FLIP EVERY DVD TO SEE THE SHOWS IN ORDER. THAT TO ME IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND NOT MENTION WHEN YOU ORDER OR ON THE BOX. SONY-WONDER SHOULD BE ASHAME OF IT SELF. SEASON 1 WAS ONLY RECORDED ON ONLY ONE SIDE, LIKE IT'S SUPPOSE TO."
2,A Good Best Of Foreigner,"I have always loved Foreigner since i was a little kid. The problem with some of the other best of Foreigner is that they lacked all the best tunes. ""The Best And Beyond"" should have been the best and then that should have been all we as fans needed to buy. I am happy to see Long Long Way From Home on a disc with Hot Blodded , Urgent and Cold As Ice! Another song i have always liked but never owned was ""Blue Morning Blue Day! As in most cds Foreigner had filler tunes but like Eddie Money the big hits over powered the cds anyway."
2,Sweet on this Game,"Purchased this game for my soon-to-be seven year old five years ago, and she still thinks it rocks. The candy pics are stunning. My twoish tot has been doggin' this game lately, and it's still holding up! With all due respect to the first reviewer of this product- I do believe that this game does offer various learning opportunities besides the whole obvious memory deal, such as: color i.d., counting, taking turns, candy history, cavity ed., etc. A forever fave."
2,Very Insightful story!,"I absolutely loved this book by Jane Hamilton. She wrote it with plenty of laughter, tears and insightfulness on a very touchy subject...child abuse. I adored her characters, namely Alice, Theresa Howard, even Nellie! I have recommended this book as well as her first one, to my sisters bookclub and several reader friends. I give Jane Hamilton a thumbs up! GO GIRL!"
1,problem and sorry i purchased....,"well, i thought i was getting a good deal on this exercise bike for my daughter; it arrived in a timely manner and it was packaged well; but while putting it together, i realized they had sent me two of the same bolts, right's only and i needed a left bolt; so i called customer service and they were nice and promised to send one out to me; and they did-so i had one side already put together; was just waiting on the left bolt and when it arrived; it would not screw in; the threads are messed up or something else is not right; i can't get the bolt to screw in!!!so i've had this piece of fitness equipment for almost a year now and it has not been used! i wish i could return it but i quickly trashed the box it came in...sorry i purchased this; too many problems-"

1,not the best,"Kerastase, Lait Vital Proteine Hair Conditioner is at best okay. I really enjoy Kerastase hair products however I found this conditioner to weight my hair down. It also doesn't leave my hair sliky smooth as other conditioners."
1,Most of this can be found on website,"Not only can you find most of this stuff on website but when it comes to games like everquest, where things do change on a regular basis, books like this quickly become out-dated. Save yourself a few bucks and go do a search on the internet for ""everquest"", their are many excellent sites that will provide you with the information that is in this book for nothing or for a low fee."
2,"Good, but...","I really liked this book and I love the main character of Tempe Brennan. The characters are well drawn and multi-dimensional and I loved all of the tidbits about forensics and anthropology. The locations were rich in detail and I felt like I was there. My only complaint about this book was that I had every single plot point figured out a good 30-50 pages before Tempe did. There wasn't a single thing in this book that surprised me. But it was still an enjoyable read and even if I knew that going in, I would still read it."
1,Fair brush,"You get what you pay for. If i had to do it all over again i would have spent a few more shekels on a higher quality product. Yes, it does the job but i am constantly picking out hairs from my soap, razor and face. Very annoying. I can only imagine this brush lasting 2 months at most with the amount of hair it loses. Do yourself a favor and steer clear."
1,Being Fair....I am a fan of hers,"and I really enjoyed her previous works, more than I could have ever imagined, but this record is horrible. The songs are trite, the lyrics are incredibly boring, indulgent and immature. The music is pop staple, with forgetable melodies and repetative chorus lines, I feel as if the studio wrote the entire album for her while she was sleeping, this just doesn't speak to any of her previous works at all. This album fits on the same shelf with a Nickelodeon-themed CD. Instead of heading in the direction of an artist like Alanis Morrisette, she is going backward and joining the ranks of Hannah Montana and the Naked Brothers Band. She is a great artist and her first two records are amazing. She is better than this CD and I am looking forward to her next effort."
2,Good weblogic 6.1 book available on the market.,"If you try to find the in-depth technical JAVA 2 Enterprise Edition with BEA Weblogic 6.1, this book is very awesome. This book tell you how to setup all JDBC, EJB, JTS, RMI, JSP, Servlet, and ""how-to-do"" application deployment. You cannot find from other books in-depth details like this book.Only things, I cannot find the CD includes all source codes in this book. Also I expect to see more details on cluster configuration and impacts on others (jndi, ejb, jsp, servlet), if I have cluster web farms. The best of the best, if you can introduce weblogic 7.0."
2,"Good sleeping bag, but not exactly 40F","For the price of this sleeping bag it can't be beat. I brought it to use on my camping trip and I did not expect the weather to dip into the 40's overnight but it did! I was sleeping in jeans, 2 t-shirts and a hoodie and was still cold (partly due to me being on the ground also, but that's expected from camping).I would say this sleeping bag is more appropriate for the 50's temperature range but definitely not 40's. The following night it was in the 50's and I slept like a baby in this thing, perfect!"
1,A shower radio that is does not work well with water and is not for morning showers,"The volume, memory, and tuning controls are a pain in the butt. i.e. if you want to change the volume, you have to press the ""volume button"", then the up/down buttons. However, if you are not fast enough, you have to hit the ""volume button again"". Considering that in most cases I am barly awake when I go into the shower in the a.m., this radio is hard to use. ---- OH YEAH, the radio has stopped working after 3 months. It is not located by a direct hit under the showerhead, in fact it's the furthest away from the showerhead in my shower, yet it still got water inside and stopped working. This was a slow death that started with buttons getting stuck, then losing the LCD screen, then death."
2,AMAZING!,"This stuff tastes exactly like soy sauce - only better! Seriously! I was on a health kick, and picked this up in the organics section of my local grocery store. I thought ""eh, it will probably be weird, but it will be good for me."" It is NOT weird at all! Compare the nutrition facts of Bragg Liquid Aminos and regular soy sauce and you will be amazed! regular soy has 920 mg of sodium PER SERVING, while Bragg's has only 160 mg. No need to refrigerate - and it has a 3-5 year shelf life but contains NO PRESERVATIVES. ZERO CALORIES. I will never go back to traditional soy sauce again!"
2,Mechanical Aptitude and Spacial Relations Test review,I found this book to be very using in preparing for the Postal PS-8 & PS-11 exams.
2,Charming...,"Mihai Eminescu's poems are the best example of a genius' work. In order to gain an introspective look in the Romanian culture, folklore and myths, one simply has to read a single poem. You will surely love his poetry...The poem entitled "" Luceafarul "" - The Evening Star is his best poem, dealing with love, deception, man's condition versus the condition of the Immortals... Stop doing whatever you are doing now and start reading!!!"
1,Bad..Ok one more time; pay attention this time- BAAAAADDDD!!!!!!,"Worst make of Nokia...I guess N3310 was far better than this one...No battery life...No internal phone memory..and even if u add a memory card, u cant transfer anything from it to the phone memory as it is very less...no ringtone compatibility- the nokia tools sucks big time and doesnt know wat to encode into from a normal mp3...voicemail feature not proper...Camera is ok...Ringtone volume of those in there already is good..But overall, STAY AWAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY FROM THIS PHONE!!!!! LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE...GOD BLESS U!!"
1,Build quality not so good,"The table sure looks nice, and nothing beats free shipping on this kind of heavy thing. However, the build quality is not so good from the two tables I bought:1. One top surface panel's veneer has some bubbles in it2. One bottom panel was scratched with a big hole (probably during shipping). I end up mix and match to have only one overall good looking table facing outwards3. Many locking screws can't be tightened up enough (the holes are not deep enough)4. The wood is very soft, so be careful with the tools you use"
1,what a waist of time,"Who would have thought, that with such a ""great"" list of actors & actresses that this movie would be so bad. The scrip must have been written by a foul mouthed teenager as it had no depth and no direction & every other word was a swear word. Do people really talk like that? Not were I live and thank goodness. YUK"
2,the strange world of public libraries,"The second book of comics about the Mallville Public Library is just as funny and true as the first.If you want to try before you buy, you can read their entire archive online at http://www.overduemedia.com or buy a 'Read Responsibly' t-shirt."
2,A good introduction,"A bit biased towards using stem cells but not too much. He really tries to just show you the basics of the debate and the science behind the debate, which many people dont know. So if you want to understand more about stem cells, where they come from, their potential, the alternatives, etc. this is the book to start with."
2,CANNIBAL BLOOD GIRL...,"Although this film is lowbudget, and you can tell, it's still alot of fun. Every single short within the anthology is completely different! My two favorites were CANNIBAL BLOOD GIRL and SPEAK EASY. Cannibal blood girl and speak easy were the only films that had been made by directors with previous experience. Creep Creepersin and James Cullen Bressack. I loved seeing Sophie Dee but naked covered in blood in Cannibal Blood Girl. Speak easy was just a low budget gore pleasure that was quite artistic and fulfilled a fantasy of mine to see gore with dubstep. Pretty sweet! If you like lowbudget anthologies, you are gonna like this one so check it out!"
1,The boxing was good,"This episode could have, should have been a 5 star. It's a refreshing break from the ever-present cylon threat.However...Kara's a frak-up. Lee's an insufferable twit. Their character flaws serve as the basis for the majority of the side-plot turned main plot, and it's about as annoying as they can make it. The pace and frequency of flashbacks is jarring and pointless, and the fact that these character flaws (the same ones, again and again) are driven to the point of inanity. There's no telling if this will affect the series' overarching plot, because this episode is nothing but highschool drama.That's right, I said it- highschool drama. This series deserved better."

2,Seeing Through Statistics,It was a very reasonable price especially when compared to what my College Bookstore was asking. It contained both the CD and the IfoTrac that it advertised. It arrived promptly and even had a thank you note!
1,Not Worth It,"Just because a movie is supposed to be scary, is visually stunning in a few brief moments doesn't mean it's good. Jennifer Lopez didn't help this movie either. When I Watched this movie I was not impressed, this movie is just a weird combination of other movies. It's ""Lawnmower man, Nightmare on Elm St, and Silence of the Lambs"" thrown in one big blender and set to mush. I didn't think one part of this movie was even remotely interesting or scary. Vince Vaughn acted Lethargic and D'Onfrio just wasn't scary. No good acting + bad overall story= NOT WORTH IT. Sorry but I just report the facts."
2,Million dollar home business,"The Next Millionaires written by Professor Paul Zane Pilzer keeps you focused on your home based business.Any entrepreneur that wants to capitalize using the internet to sell their product, service will gain a good foundation on what to sell and understanding direct selling through todays technology.Pilzner discusses direct selling as a massive economic opportunity for a home based business that can achieve great success using technology available today. If you want to run a small direct selling business from your home this book is a must read.This book is easy to understand and provides a starting point for a home based business entrepreneur."
2,Funny looking thing,When I first got it I kind of didn't like because of the front wheel fork being so thin that can be twisted and even broken easily. It didn't seem funny at first and I was almost ready to sell it when I showed it to my 10 months old son and he loved it. He enjoyed so much that I decided to keep it for him when he is older.
1,This Book Is Sick,"I loved The Persian Pickle Club, so I picked up The Chili Queen from the library. It started with a character who was the madam of a whorehouse, so, considering the warmth of The Persian Pickle Club, I figured it was a story of redemption. Wrong! There are no likeable characters. They are, to a person, all amoral people committing immoral and illegal acts. I kept waiting for one of them to change, but no, they were evil right to the end. Although Dallas writes well, and her description of people generated a few laughs, and the plot twists were a bit of a surprise (although I guessed one), at the end of the book I felt sick and very sorry I had read it. Oh, and she throws in the detailed rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl. I need a shower."
1,Irritated my face..,"Usually Neutrogena products do miracles on my face. I have severe acne and I have to have a facial regimen in order to keep my breakouts tamed. Once I ran out of Neutrogens's Stress Gel I started to use this product. The first day was okay, but the next couple of days my skin got worse. As of today 1/31/2011, my skin has broken out in other spots where I didnt have acne. The areas also turned red and my face itches and burns. I have since stopped using the product. Im just hoping the itching and redness will stop soon. This problem has never occured with any other acne products. If you have sensitive skin or other skin problems..beware of this product."
2,one of my all-time favorite movies!,"i love this movie, and i'm _very_ disappointed to discover that it is not currently available! the movie is fun, witty, and well-acted, and i find myself going back and re-watching it often. i can only hope that it will be re-released...preferably on both videotape and dvd. i'll be one of the first in line to buy it!"
1,Um.. . . really?,"The Catholic Church is built on traditions that take us through a re-tracing of Christ's life -- the liturgical year. Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, I suggest the author take a fresh and unbiased look at the original source -- the Roman Catholic Church."
1,Folk art,This wasn't my cup of tea and wasn't what I'd want in my back yard. The book was in good condition and arrived promptly. The content wasn't what I ws personally interested in.
2,Great Albums-Why have they dissapeared?,"When I was a little boy, I used to love the Tom Glazer albums in the Activity and Game Songs Series, labeled by CMS Records. We had copies of Volumes One and Two. Volume Two got warped in the car, and Volume One got scratched and we had to throw them out. We tried to replace them by ordering them from CMS Records. But we found out that they had gone out of business. Please ask Vanguard Records would come to their senses and convert these albums to CD so they can be reissued. The lessons Tom Glazer Teaches are desperately needed in Today's violent and synical society. Through their songs, children can visit a much gentler place."
1,Thorough but unsatisfying,Tons of footage from the attack and propaganda from the period but ultimately unfulfilling. Felt like a very long slide strip from elementary school.
1,Dissapointed and Unsatisfied,"The book had a beginning a middle and no end.I felt like I had read the very long introduction to the ending to be found in a future book (which I will not read).Unless Demille's message is that terrorists are smarter than the combined world law enforcement agencies, the NYPD is the smartest of that group, and the world is at the ""mercy"" of terrorists the book should have had a reasonable ending."
1,Eleven on Top,"The story is great; it is THE TAPES I am complaining about. I gave it 1 star because there was nothing lower. The first shipment I received had THE END OF THE STORY missing. I returned it, and received a new one. This tape is missing even more of the story at the end. So it must be a manufacturing defect. No matter how great the book is, when you don't get to hear the ending it is pretty disappointing."
2,"A little too big, but cute.","This is well made but a little too big for me. It can fit 2 sticks of butter, which some might find handy."
2,"Classic Album, Great Condition of Vinyl",This was a rare classic and gem I heard about and had to have. The vinyl when received was in GREAT condition.I love sitting back relaxing to a George Duke record. This album was recorded in Braziland is GREAT music. If you are a fan of Duke's bodies of work you WILL love this!
1,Trash,"I really HATE it when I buy a book thinking it was a new one, only to find it written in '08. It is silly, with little (if any) plot except romance. BLAH!!!!!"
2,Clear and engaging. Excellent.,"Straightforward, understandable, entertaining, with an easy-going style, chock full of explanations--both solemn and humorous--and examples--both historical and contemporary. This volume teaches. I learned. I can't think of a better book for personal exploration or for the classroom. It was originally the textbook for a course I was taking at the university, but it became a textbook I could never bring myself to sell back. Years later I still keep it on my shelves for both reference and recreation."
1,Garbage,"I bought this back before they changed the product image. They used to have a picture of the official Zune cable with the Zune logo, so I got it not knowing that it's one of those cheap knock-offs. I was rather peeved by that.I just use the cable to charge my Zune, and it works for that, most of the time. Being cheaply made, it doesn't fit snugly in the device, so occasionally you walk away thinking it's charging, only to return and find your battery dead. This is annoying. The cable doesn't last very long either. I had two of these a while ago, and they both literally fell apart after about a year or two. On one of them, the plastic on the Zune-end literally fell to pieces when I squeezed it one day. On the other one, the squeeze button on the side fell out. If you plan to keep your Zune for a while, I recommend getting the official $7.99 Sync Cable from Zune on here."
1,Unreliable,"I've purchased this unit with two handsets roughly one year ago. Issues I've experienced include no record of calls that I received and messages not showing up. I physically listened to my wife leaving me a message one day. When I attempted to playback and delete it, there was no record of the call. In the past 45 days I know of two other similar issues. The only other complaint I have has to do with the base unit flashing, but not emitting an audible tone when a new message is present. The phone works well, I just cannot trust it. There is clearly some sort of unresolved manufacturer's defect which is why I rated it 1 star. The phone is very clear, comfortable to talk on, and both the battery talk and stand by times are sufficient. I'll be purchasing a new phone ASAP, it just won't be another GE. We had a Sony phone for 5 years and we were very happy with it. We bought the GE because the Sony interfered with our wireless network."
1,Typical white boy pollution,"Blues from new york? Uh, you get what you pay for. If you like amature white boy hour then this is the CD for you."
1,Not worth the time,"I can't remember what I paid to buy this book, but whatever the price; its not worth your time. I threw it away the day I got it. My school textbooks were a 1000 times better to look through. If you no longer have your textbooks; your best bet to start studying for the EIT is to get the Engineer-In-Training Referene Manual and its solution book. From there you can figure out what you are deficient in and rebuild your library."
2,Hobbit,"I really liked this book. The beginning was kind of slow, but if you keep on reading you can't put it down. I really like how he used the main character as a hobbit (or really small person), instead of this tall, masculine person, who works on a farm, and all the chicks dig him, because people like that have ""a really hard time proving themselves"".That why I like The Hobbit, because Bilbo proved himself even though he's three foot tall.It shows us that height and weight have nothing to do with our character. We could be four foot five and two hundred pounds outside, but a seven foot high one hundred forty pound body builder inside."
1,Worst Hockey Movie EVER!!!,"I love hockey, but this is the worst hockey movie I ever saw. The ""Goon"" acts like he's retarded. I wasted $20 on this, and I'm sure I'll never watch it again."
1,Disappointing,"I've grown up in the shadow of Uncle Ted. I'm almost 50 and when I was about 20 I remember reading about his draft dodge story when he was being interviewed by some magazine. Don't remember which one.I've seen him in concert a couple of times and must say he puts on a great show and no one can put more of themselves into a concert than him. That's who he is to me. A brillant rocker. He has walked through rock and roll history. That's what I wanted to hear about. I was really embarrassed for him. I love guns, hunting and right to carry but what does that have to do with what he has given his fans for over 30 years. He lives a stones throw from my house now. If I met him on the street I'm not sure I would know what to say to him. He's a great man. It's just a sadly boring irrelevant book.I really hope he gets a good ghost writer and tells of all the amazing things he's experianced in his life."
2,Pleasant Surprize,"Yet another film I already knew about, although the plot is a little silly, I enjoyed watching Peter O'Toole and Audrey Hepburn whom I simply adore, over & over because they displayed darn good acting. There are also moments where they are quite funny as well. Equally enjoyable are Eli Wallach, Charles Boyer & Hugh Griffith. Additionally, generally you can't go wrong with a William (Billy)Wyler movie either. Very good entertaining work will be found here."
2,WOW,"If you are a ship expert, or just want to find a little information, this is for you. Braynard and Miller did a spectacular job! They wrote enough info. so you know and understand each ship, but aren't so detailed that the book bores the reader. This book is a must have for anyone interested in ocean liners."
1,Didn't help,"Tried this for a month. Didn't really help with my IBS, but then nothing else has either. . . ."
1,disillusioned,"I ordered this 4 book ""boxed"" set for my grandaughter as a Christmas present. The books looked like they have been repeatedly handled and the ""box"" was a piece of light cardboard that had been hand formed into a box and sealed with clear packing tape. If you are expecting anything professional, forget about it. I am so disappointed and so never going to purchase anything from this company again."
2,Different but works,"This model was different that the model that I was looking for , but it worked and works fine a month later."
1,WORST ALBUM BY HIM! FLAT! INSULTING!,"I think that this is the worst album that Ja Rule has made. He could have taken more effort to have made it better. His attacks at 50 Cent come off as cheap, cold, insulting, heartless, and downright hysterical. He could have used his talents to rap about something else on this album. And as for the music, it sounds lame, some of the songs don't make me get up and dance to them and they sound like rejects from other Murder Inc. artists. His sing-song rap style is missing on most of the songs. And his attacks at 50 Cent tend to go overboard--is he THAT angry? He seem to be angry on most of the songs. Right now 50 is one of the hottest rappers now--Ja needs to accept that and this album just doesn't do it for me. It sounds rushed and he needs to reevalutate his music career if he wants to continue!"
1,Not for young potty trainers,"At first this video caught my daughter attention since it features Elmo. But there's very little action, so she bored of it quickly. It's more of an interview movie, where he talks to other puppets about the potty. Not very engaging for the potty training age range. This would have been more effective if you actually saw any potty training happening. She may find it more interesting, AFTER she is finished potty training, since perhaps she'll be old enough to have the patience to sit and watch a bunch of other people and puppets sit around talking for an hour."
2,Kept my interest until the very end.,The characters lives and the plot all intertwining kept my interest until the end of the book. I didn't want to put it down. Hoag develops her characters so well that imediately I felt a powerful bond to each of the weather it be positive or negative. They were so real. Overall a very well written book one of the best I have ever read!
1,"This movie was not released, it escaped!",I was cast as the villians mother but my role ended on the cutting room floor - lucky me!
1,colorado fan needs to get a clue,"I'm sorry but if your a DJ and think that ATB's music is good, then I would hate to hear you spinning at a club in San Diego. I'll admit his beat is 'unique' but that doesn't by default make it 'great', like you suggest. There is a big difference between unique and great, and thats something that you have yet to understand. The people who enjoy this lackluster CD are the same people who buy 'trance' compilations that have ATB mixes... they don't know what they're talking about (because ATB is obviously not Trance)! ATB is no where near the class of great DJs such as Matt Darey, Keoki, and Tony De Vit (and others). If your looking for something different then get this CD, but if your looking for something good don't waste your money."
1,Chair pockets,"Not satisfactory for either chair we have. Removed the ""table"" portion and it fits the arms OK."
1,Rosle made in China is rough around the edges,"I've bought dozens of Rosle items. The current batch of Made in China items are making me hesitant to buy any more Rosle items unless they're made in Germany, like they used to be.I have this vegetable spoon. Just received it today. The front lip is rough if I use my fingernail to go along the edge, all around the spoon.The quality control and finishing of Rosle items made in China are MUCH lower than the brand and the price deserve.Beware if you buy Rosle in the USA. It's probably 'Made in China' and a second rate item."
1,Skimpy,I thought this book was longer than it is and have more insight into the outcome of one's painting. I guess I was looking for more of an interpretive book.
2,a! Shub Niggurath!,"Shub Niggurath, the black goat of the wood with a thousand young, is mearly hinted at in H.P. Lovecraft's fiction. Mentioning little more then the name and appellation, old Shubby is shrouded in mystery. Price has compliled here some of the works which have followed Lovecraft's scant clue to define Shub Niggurath. Price includes one of his own stories, a tale sexual decadence, perversion and madness in the name of Shub Niggurath which, of itself, makes the book worth reading."
2,Great movie,I loved this movie. It's about Sponge Bob and Patrick going to Shell City to get King Neptune's crown. ANd while SB and P are going to Shell City Plankton takes over the world. IT's a great movie. See it.
2,For once the monsters get to be the good guys.,"I read the short story that this movie is based on years before seeing the film. Usually this is enough to ruin either the movie or the book for me but for once I was pleasantly surprised. Well acted, good cinematography and more than just about every other print to film conversion it follows the story quite well. A must see!"
2,Oh Were Of To See The Wizard,This is truly a classic that will live on for ages to come. this movie is awesome. it's a must see
1,Not for the uninitated,If you're trying to find the origin of various religious practices and differences this is not the book. Green assumes that reader knows what various terms are and often I did not (and I'm studying to be a Baptist Preacher). Why does the Catholic Bible have extra books from the protestant? Couldn't find it in here. How did the Baptists rise to dominance in the U.S.? Who knows? It's not here. The text is dry and unenlightening. I believe there are many better books for the uninitiated and even the fairly well initiated.
1,No Light to the Saber,"My son wanted to be a Jedi Knight for Halloween, so I purchased this light saber. We had a multi-colored toy just like it from Disney that lit up, so I thought this one would too. Unfortunately it did not and this caused a problem. My five year old was quite upset that there was no ""Light"" to his ""Light Saber"".It's not a bad concept, but it's a cheap toy not worth it's price."
2,"FOR THE BEST OF 60'S, 70'S, AND 80'S ROCK ,TUNE INTO OK GO!","OK GO has a nice mix of retro rock. GET OVER IT, their 1st single, sounds like the J Giels Band, with a drum beat of love stinks, mixed with keyboards of Angel in the centerfold. Then you have track 2 DON'T ASK ME , which reminded me of Adam Ant. In other songs on the record I could hear Queen, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles as well. If you are a fan of 60's-80's rock music, you will absolutely love OK GO'S self-titled release! I for one, do like this type of music, and to be able to listen to this in a new band is great! With all of these differnt styles blended together, I found OK GO to be quite enjoyable!"
1,pleater tape,I was very disappointed in the pleater tape. It looks old and shelf worn. Not what I needed as far as stiffness or quality.
1,Not worth it at any price.,"I can't explain the satisfaction of the previous reviewer other than his trimmer came from a different batch or factory. My Remington MB-10 recently died after a good, long life and I would buy that trimmer again if it were available. Replaced it with the MB-20. After the difficult task of removing it from the perma-package, I found it to be much cheaper quality than the old trimmer. The battery cover won't stay in place when attempting to turn it on and the switches are rediculously difficult to move. Shouldn't be that hard to turn on and off or adjust. Poor design and poor build quality. Not sure what happened to Remington as it feels like a cheap toy. Back to Amazon it goes."
2,Incredible girl,"Wow!This girl is awesome. Well produced, well performed. Very polished jazzy feel. The instrumentation is also very, very good.Favorite tracks: 2 & 10"
2,"Here Fishy, Fishy, Fishy....","If you're like me & you PREFER to grill with a whole fish vs. the portioned off cuts then you will LOVE this gadget! Here's the trick - Open the basket. Line the inside with parsely, rosemary & bay leaves. If you want to get 'fancy' you can weave the rosemary & parsely branches/twigs into the grates of the basket. I don't but you certainly can! ;)Take your fish (like a yummy snapper), rub-a-dub the fishy with garlic, olive oil & parsley (the ""holy trinity"" of mediterranean cooking) and of course, salt & pepper. Slide your fishy into the herb-decorated basket & cook away!How fantastic to flip the fish without it ripping & falling apart!!! Happy Grilling!"
2,funny movie,"A good, funny movie about being awkward and learning how to live with that awkwardness! Should be required for all teens, to show them it's okay just to be you."
2,WW II story of Nazi occupied Rome.,"Based on a true story (The Scarlet Pimpernell of the Vatican) of Msgr Hugh O'Flaharty of the Vatican who runs a clandestine operation to hide allied servicemen and Jews in and around German occupied Rome. His nemisis, S.S. Col. Herbert Kapler, is played by Christopher Plummer. Pope Pius XII is played by Sir John Guilgood. Excellent scenes of the Vatican and Rome, coupled with interesting insight to the rest of the story regarding the Vatican's work with the victims of the war. Good performances and entertaining. END"
1,If you prefer books over the Internet.,"Some people don't enjoy reading a computer screen. If that's you, then you'll appreciate the book."
1,not an author children should read,"Mr Whittle is a skilled writer. However his fiction should be written for adults, where the problems won't affect impressionable minds.The first thing that disturbed me was the poor English of Quon Lee. While those learning English as adults might have difficulty pronouncing certain sounds that their native language don't contain, this would not be the case with a little boy. It's not true that ""Chinese tongues"" are unable to make the l sound, etc. Add that to the portrayal of the Jewish tailor as always whining, you get ""old-fashioned"" in the bad sense of the term.Then Lizzy was involved in smuggling, in effect stealing from the government & those obeying the law. Then blackmail. It's not OK to blackmail someone even when that someone isn't a good person.And I certainly don't think that people kept in a barrel would be alive at the end of a week. They either would starve, die of thirst, or suffocate. Maybe not all, but at least some."
1,"shockingly poor construction, probably used before--stay away","While I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the order arrived, I was quickly disappointed. The packaging was shoddy, hinting that I may have been handed a previously returned item. As soon as I was done assembling the base, I realized it wouldn't work: the holes in the metal parts were so badly aligned, and the two legs were of unequal height, that it would not sit flush on all four legs. I could have assembled the rest of it thinking to just ""make do"" with it, but why should I waste 60 dollars on a bad product. I have decided to return it asap, hoping to find another brand which has not botched this very simple product."
1,TERRIBLE!,My husband and I really don't like this toy. First of all it is not very sturdy - my 8 month old easily tips it as she tries to pull up to standing. And it slides across the floor as she tries to pull up on it. Worst of all it is designed poorly as the the balls get stuck in the track as they spiral down - very annoying. It's too bad as this toy has potential. My daughter loves to stand and play and likes the silly music the toy plays. But now she only plays with the balls the toy came with.
2,Learning slides review,"These are very nice, but the paper is peeling off of a couple of them already (and we just opened them yesterday. Otherwise, they are great for teaching kids."
2,MAGNIFICENT,"This is one of the best book's ever written on world war two.I learned a lot reading this book. Imagine a front 3000 miles long!This book is full of information I had never read before.It let's you get into the conversation's of Hitler, Canaris, Goering, Himmler, and the long suffering General Guderian. The author left me with the impression that the Soviet's could have defeated Hitler without allied help. My understanding of president Roosevelt's prosecution of the war took a major step down. The only problem i had with this book was the lack of good map's. But i still give it 5 star's."
1,Disappointing,The questions in the game are too easy and the game play is not very interesting. I think this game would be a good value for [money] but not at almost [money].
2,The Master of metaphor is at it again,"This Film is another example of what an Artist can bring forth when they are paying close attention to their surroundings,very good acting and pacing of storyline,if you have been watching and paying attention to Romero's Dead films before this, there is an ever growing trend in this film towards the end and the two Dead films after this one, the people in these films are using the zombies as excuses to do whatever they want, as this is a mirror image of what is exactly going on in the world right now as in he past, yet its accelerating due to the fact that large percentages of the population have lost the Spiritual component to their lives. As with all Romero's fims about the living dead,we have a choice,same choice as the first choice,look around you,outside,at work,in traffic,at the stores,millions of people that do not even know that they are Alive,its time to wake upThank You,Jerry Jay Hanson"
2,WOW!!! AMAZING!,This Cd is simply amazing!! A must buy for any fans! Don't Speak is still brilliant!
1,"cheapo, at least it behaves like one","I rated it 1 star because it won't allow me to rate it lower than that. i got what i paid for. got it last Nov, less than one year. it can't power up anymore. Never see this in any other laptops I have used. Wait, this is not all. I am not the only one whose is busted. My friend followed my footstep and bought the same model around the same time. Guess what? you got it, same problem. wont power on. Mother board busted. Mine is on its way to Fremont now for repair. I am sure it's mother board problem as well. This really changed my view about HP products. THANKS A LOT!Regret that I recommended to my friends, so I am posting this message here for you to NOT fall for it."
2,A Blues Tribute To Jimi Hendrix,I'm sure these guys love the music - specially of Muddy Waters & Jimi Hendrix. There Is fantastic sound and climate of their music - this is the best collection of all time for blues - the blues of Muddy Waters and Jimi Hendrix. The Guitar Lovers - you have to have it.
1,"Booo! Bad writing. Bad, bad writing.","Does anyone say ""Crazy getup""? If they do, I wish they wouldn't. There's too many examples of bad cliche writing in this that I don't have time to point them all out. I was looking for a good time travel romance. This isn't it."
1,Excellent Concept... Too Long,"I enjoyed the concept of this book but for what it was and what it really wanted to tell us, it was far too long. If you are going to make a novel of epic proportions, then you need to create some kind of world like Anne Rice does."
2,Wonderful MP3!!!,"My 4 year old loves this MP3 player! He is able to switch songs and adjust the volume by himself. The headphones have worked great and have decent sound quality. We have had no problems with it and he takes it EVERYWHERE, so it has taken some bumps and drops. He enjoys the songs that came on the disk and I have been able to download new songs and audio books to it. The two headphone jacks have come in handy when he has friends over or in the car, and the speaker works great for when he is running around playing. It has a latch that he can attach to his belt loop. Great product!!"
2,A fantastic novel through the eyes of a great man,"I just finished reading this novel and I must admitt it is one of the best novels I have read this year. It really is an exciting travel through the 20th century, through the eyes of a man who's carreer made him involved with major political and social events. I would say this is a must to anyone interested in photography and journalism, and a recommended for anyone with a heartbeat. I really loved this book."
1,Without the usual breathtaking tension..,"I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed in this book and in Tom Clancy (I've read them all). It seems that he starting to repeat himself, and the story is VERY predictable. One of the things I really used to like about a Tom Cancy novel was that the story was always hard to figure out, and Mr Clancy always liked to stretch the reader's fantasy and imagination. I really hope that the next one will be better, otherwise I will have to look somewhere else (maybe he should concentrate less on the games, and prepare the novels more???)"
1,Turns off all of the time,"Awful FM Transmitter, it plays horribly through my car's speakers and it also turns off all of the time for no reason at all while I am listening to music! Spend your money on a better transmitter that won't turn off as you're enjoying your music."
1,"""Balanced"" in what way?","So, let me get this straight. If I write ""The Case for Green Leprechauns,"" and I proceed to interview every expert on the matter WHO BELIEVES IN GREEN LEPRECHAUNS and not a single one who doesn't, then according to Lee Strobel and his book I would be engaging in ""balanced"" journalism. ?!?!?!"
1,Don't Buy It!,"Want to know the ""secret"" that this author tantalizes you with? It's daily injections of URINE from a pregnant woman and to avoid all dairy products and foods that have preservatives in them. This book is total garbage! Don't buy it unless you just want to throw away your money and use the book for a fire starter!"
1,Santa Claus failed to conquer - no DVD was in the case!,"We got the DVD wrapped as new, yet there was no DVD in the case. Luckily, Amazon did a great job sending us a replacement immediately, but it was upsetting that the PASSPORT VIDEO has such poor quality control...."
1,Desperately hammy stuff.,"The line on the box, ""From the producers of '24'"" says it all. This is a simplistic, ponderous, turgid, self-important parade of cliches. I got it because it was recommended for people who liked The Killing and other Nordic noir series, but it doesn't come anywhere close to them in characterization, complexity or sophistication. Avoid."
1,a pure soap opera,"Bronte does no follow up on any characters and leaves us grasping at what the meaning of all the action. For example, someone will get married and then Bronte just leaves it at that. Just because they fight with each other later on merely shows that self absorbed people don't get along. Dear Bronte, if you're going to write a book, add more to the characters and don't just state the obvious. Also, why did you include that dream about Cathy Linton in the beginning and not have any more supernatural stuff later? You should involve the supernatural and not just mention or include it. One star is generous"
1,Does not fit R817,"This dock does NOT fit the R817 Camera. Just bought this and the HP R817 and I am very disappointed. The input for the camera is to big for the 817. So do not buy this if you get the 817 **update** This review was written, when the dock was stated to fit the R817, which has been changed because it does not fit."
1,The Waltons first seasom,The Programs are good except the the first two DVDS in this series are not copied real good in that the sound track is off on the first part of these DVDs. The rest of the programs in this series are good.
1,CVOGEL,"Ok but the lever that adjusts from mild to strong, didnt do any good. The water dripped out at the same rate regardless of my setting."
2,Changelling fun - for serious 'thinkers' only!,"I have had this game for years, and have loved it from the beginning. It is easy to understand, but not for anyone who doesn't like to think. The cards are often complicated - it's not like a trivia game! Sometimes a question can take a while to ponder and figure out, so it's not for anyone who wants a fast paced game. The game is very challenging and fun for people who like logic games. It is best played with a group, but can be adapted to play in pairs as well. I will even pull out random cards myself for fun! The sceond version, Mindtrap II, is somewhat better, with many different types of questions. However, I would reccomend this to get you ready for the second version!"
1,"Worked OK for 4 years, now no picture, just audio","It wasn't a great VCR, but it did work, for 4 years. Only 4 years. One day, today, it stopped showing the video. You could hear the audio, but no video. Everything the other folks are saying about this thing is true: it's noisy rewind and fast forward. I thought my previous VCR, a Hitachi, didn't last long when it died after 9 years. 4 years is ridiculous. Stay away from Panasonic."
1,Very Disappointed - Low Quality Tie Rack,"The picture of this product is misleading. Instead of the pictured item I received a tie rack that was essentially a staight piece of wood with rounded ends. There is no taper like you see in the picture. The item is made in China made evident by a sticker on the packaging. If you look down the side, the nails or 'tie hangers' don't line up evenly. They have different angles and depths that make the item look really poorly made. One of the belt hooks spins and there is no way to tighten it. The actual wood appears solid but the manufacturing appears very rushed. I highly recommend passing on this tie rack and looking elsewhere."
2,The Traveler's Gift - a good book for discussions.,"Both of my book clubs have enjoyed reading this book. We have found it quick and easy to read, full of historical figures with which we can relate, and full of good standards that hold up to how we were raised. This book is worth your while to read and good to share with others."
2,Good item,"This product is overall good, the only problem with it is that our baby can get out of it if she wants to, she can kick the part off of her feet and even the part around her sometimes. She is 6 months old. We only use this swaddle for naps away from home, we keep it in her diaper bag because it is more compact than the Halo innovations one (which we use most of the time). It is also probably not as warm as the halo innovations one. This swaddle has really good velcro and is very soft, it also is much more adjustable than many brands. If you are going to get a swaddle with a pocket, this is the one I would get."
1,7 week cycling for fitness,If you know nothing about cycling its good. But if you have spent a whisker of time in the saddle its a little boring.
2,GARMIN-C340 Street Pilot-The perfect navigator,"Looking for a personal navigator on-line will yeild a plethora of navigating electronic boxes. But, who's is who's, what is what, this one or that one and why pay more or why pay less. The simple answer is to ask the people who have already purchased one. They can tell you the good points and of course the bad points. I wanted one for my father in-law who happens to need one that basically does all the work for you. The Garmin C340 fit exactly what he needed, easy to use, no real need to read through pages of instruction, very straight forward, uses real street name and not coordinates, finds gas, food and lodging at the touch of a button. What more could anyone ask for. The C340 is it...wa-la...we're here."
1,Too bad no one read the book,"This movie called Stuart Little because its title character is a mouse, not because it has anything to do with E.B White's book of the same name. I felt like I was watching a re-telling of ""Annie"" rather than seeing a film version of a great story. A typical result of creating a giant marketing and merchandising machine."
1,THIS IS NOT A CONCERT!!!,"This is an unauthorized documentary, just like the last few done recently with critics giving their opinions about Thin Lizzy. The quality of the live footage is terrible and thrown together with the worst audio imaginable. If you are a Thin Lizzy fan you probably already have this footage on video.Why in 2006 is their not more ""official"" Thin Lizzy concerts and footage availiabe(we know it exsists) with all the enhancements that could be done with older footage? These bottom feeders that produce this ""junk"" hoping fans throw them a few dollars(like I did) should be ashamed of themselves. Avoid at all costs!! If you do buy this dvd, like I did ""you will be sorry."" I wish I knew what I would be expecting before unwrapping, so at least I could return and get my money back."
2,The Court of Two Sisters Cookbook,The history was very inviting to read. I plan to revisit this section before another visit to New Orleans. The number of recipes was disappointing but did have several of the restaurants staples in it.
1,Mishapened topper,"Unfortunately, when this item was received, it was so mashed down that the incline of the piece was hardly noticeable. It could not be used right away because the incline was not proper and we let it lay out in hopes that the shape it should be would return. Didn't return to normal.Not to happy."
2,Great Album to listen to and dance to! He is Terrific!!,"I've listened to LaFave for a long time, and have seen him perform in Dallas Texas, every time he is in town. His singing truely touches my soul personally, and for that I Love him. My kids know every single song he sings, and everyone knows he is my favorite artist, He has a great band too, and those guys are truely talented!! I Wish them all continued success, Because if any one deserves to be recognized its for sure Jimmy and his Band!"
1,Avoid these,"Just received these as my first pair of earbuds , replacing the old style speaker-in-the-ear phones . These just don't cut it at all, no bass whatsoever and are tinny at best . Very comfortable and fit nicely but the loss of sound , 3_d and stereo perception are really non-existant. may try the $100 stuff but this fails so miserably I may stick to the old style earphones or even proper headphones .Life is too short to listen to good music this way, the sacrifice does not do music justice .Sledge"
1,I really tried...,"I tried. I really really tried to read this book. I forced myself to read more than half of it, but then I had to give up. The plot was boring and I felt like I have read it a billion other times in a billion other boring books. The dialogue was awful, the characters were flat."
1,Laplink does not honor license.,"I purchased PCMover as part of a new computer. I transferred programs and data according to instructions, but an SQL database did not work properly on the new computer. Not surprising, this is complicated software. However, even though I reversed the original transfer, and the original transfer did not work, they would not let me use the software to transfer from a different computer to the new computer. Laplink seems to think that they can steal with impunity."
1,PI-DDLING,"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I had read all the reviews and had high expectaions. After seeing it I felt nothing. I was not disturbed, unnerved, did not replay scenes or have questions running in my mind. Just because a movie is plodding and pedantic does NOT mean it is a masterpiece. The only aspect of this movie that saves it from a zero is that it looks great. B&W does create a certain bleakness."
2,Zelda - A Long Time Coming,"Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is the best Zelda came to his consoles since Super Nintendo'sThe Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.I'm not going to write this review for noobs. For you die-hard Zelda fans out there, this is the cream of the crop. The items and weapons are awesome, with some old favorites and a few new goodies. The boss fights are incredible! It is obvious that the game makers took a lot of time on this one to make sure to get everything perfect, and when you play you will see their attention to detail and patience in release will keep you playing and playing.I recommend this title for Wii players above most other games available today - regardless if you are a Zelda player of the past or not. Come see what the talk is all about..."
1,My daughter couldn't hear herself sing.,The volume for the microphone is so low that it is hard to hear the child singing. Also the microphone cord when moved causes static and if the mic is too close to the speaker it will cause high pitch noices. Lastly the voice comes out sounding muttled and that is not when I was using the voice effect.
1,Why Did You Write This?!?,"I buy your books, Tom, because of the largeness of scope, and plot complications, and close calls, and snazzy spyworks, and worldwide intrigue, and tens of thousands of lives on the line. But ""Red Rabbit"" felt small and plodding and there weren't any plot twists and nothing really ever went wrong. And where was the payoff? When I finished it, I just went, ""So?""There's a reason I buy your books, and this wasn't it."
2,colorado confidential,i'm sorry i can't review this book i only received them two days ago i've read a few books written by this author so i'm sure i'll enjoy it
2,Western set in New Zealand,"Rather ""stilted"" British version of the western...one would almost expect the dialogue to run along the lines 'I say old chap keep a stiff upper lip...."" with a rather grim ending..considering its age it hasn't weathered too badly..Glynnis Johns and Jack Hawkins are always a treat...the unintentional funny bit was the bosomy Ms. Laya Raki tastefully dressed in a grass skirt performing a 'Maori Dance' which to me remsembled a cross between Salome's Dance and that of a belly dancer...still not bad as entertainment if you are prepared to make allowances for the corny dialogue and unconvincing fight sequences....brave pioneers founding another portion of the British Empire while 'civilizing' the natives and then undoing the good work by not practicing what you preach by playing ""footsie"" with the chief's wife; which for the time when the film was made is rather startling"
1,"Oh, ye Gads!","I shudder when I think of why this alleged ""author"" even wrote this pile of C***.What a premise! Murder at the Supreme Court; one Justice killed, his legal clerks are getting bumped off.... ahhhh! how a real who-dunit writer could have developed such a great idea.But what we have here is saccharine-sweet garbage, badly edited at that. No idea about police work, FBI agents crying like babies, and a ridiculouds construct as an end...Don't even read it from the public library; it ain't worth it.I had to give it one star because Amazon would not have accepted it otherwise; also, because Coulter abstained from graphic descriptions of sex, as it seems to be mandated now for woman writers.Otherwise....Gahhhh!"
1,Good Beginner Book,This book is good for the beginner that feels unsure in their explaination of the Tarot. Tarot Made Easy takes the reader in a simplified way through all the possible ways of interpretation of the Tarot. This book focuses more on the art of fortune telling than the exploration of the personal soul journey that can be the Tarot.
1,Love Barry Manilow's music but cassett did not play,I was very disappointed with this product. I had aticipated listening to Dance Away and the cassett although wrapped in cyclophane did not work at all. Would not recommend buying cassetts online ever.
1,"Lots of questions, little review, some accuracy","This book offers a lot of practice exams, which is nice. However there is only about 20 pages of review or discussion. The answer keys do not explain answers, they simply repeat them. As the other review states, accuracy is questionable. There are many questions in the practice exams where the answers given in the key are clearly incorrect. After the first exam I found myself questionning whether I was really missing questions that I was unsure of or whether the book just gave the wrong answer again."
2,Omar junans' wonderful review of Black Sabbath,"This book about Black Sabbath is extremely interesting. It tells about how the band evolved and became who they are now. It shows the ups and the downs of the musical scene in the seventy's and eighty's. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Ozzy Osbourne. If you like rock and roll and everything that comes with it, you will love this book."
2,"A Wonderful, Holistic Approach to Bone Health","This book is a wonderfully written reference by Nelson, who is a nutritionist with Tufts University, and who comprehensively approaches the topic of osteoporosis. Covering the approach of prevention, supplementation, medication options, and exercise, Nelson approaches this topic with humor and in a very easy-to-read style. Lots of easy reference tables and well-illustrated exercise plans make this an accessible reference for everyone."
2,best non-fiction short story I've read in a long time.,"After borrowing this book and reading it in 3 hours.I knew I had to have it for my library collection andat least 5 other people who would love it as well.The more I read, the more involved I became with theauthor. I cried when Jake died and know what it's like tohave an animal speak and listen to you, just like shorty did. I hope Lou Dean continuesto write this type of story.I highly recommend it to children and adult alike."
2,Good psychological suspense,"Tate Collier and his ex-wife Bett, are reunited to search for their missing daughter Megan, in this quite suspenseful psychological thriller. Aaron Matthews is a highly intelligent psychologist (and psycho) who can talk people into believing almost anything. The paths of Tate and Bett will soon cross with that of Matthews and we learn that something in Tate's past is the reason his daughter is missing.Filled with a few surprises and emotional situations, Deaver has written a satisfying story with some good characters. Matthews' use of language instead of tools (although tools are sometimes used) to knock his victims down, is a good change of pace. Overall, it's a good, quick entertaining read.Recommended"
2,A really good book!!!,If you like mysteries you'll love this book. It's a very exciting book and you'll want to keep reading on to finally find out who that stalker is.
2,Working out was never so fun!,"Working things out that is. I found Lloyds puzzle books to be incredibly entertaining and really helped me think outside the box. This is actually not an unheard of phenomena and is supported by many researchers in the field of creativity, that one can improve ones capacity for creative thought with puzzles like these. I found this book to be a lot of fun and would strongly reccomend it."
2,Jaw-dropping!,"I bought this book on a whim, and I am so glad that I did. The book kept me captivated.. all the way to the very end. Growing up in a sheltered Southern town, I could barely conceive of the life that this girl lived... but the brutally honest way that Souljah told the story made it so easy to visualize. If you are looking for a riveting story that will hold your attention and leave you in disbelief... then I recommend this book. You won't be disappointed."
1,RIP OFF!,At a mere 12 pages-- most of which is garbage-- this is one of the biggest ripoffs Amazon.com has to offer. The book does NOT live up to its title or its promises.Shame on you Amazon. I thought you knew better.
2,It Really Works,"While visiting my son and his family, I was really into reading this book. My son showed an interest so I bought them one as a gift. He started using it right away. He moved items around in his office and another space in his home and received two important phone calls, that will change his prosperity!Karen's humorous approach makes this book really easy to read and follow. She removes a lot of the mystic that is sometimes associated with Feng Shui. I highly recommend it to anyone that is just becoming acquainted with Feng Shui!"
1,BADDDDDDDDDD,First of all this game has no mouse control at all.To fire your weapon you have to press shift and enter at the same time and you have to use another 2 buttons to line up your shot.All other games do all this just using the mouse.That aint all every action you take you have to use 2 or 3 buttons to do it.It is not a free roaming game.You are on a path if you try to walk off of it you can't.Very linier game play and really bad controls.I just bought this game and am putting it up for sale.It is obviousley a console game adapted to get the pc dollars
1,Lame,This didn't do exactly what I expected. I assumed this would increase the aspect ratio of the camera- but in reality it simply added a magnifying glass to my lens. Which means I had to be zoomed in just to use the attachment.
2,Kick ass!,This game is one of the best online games i have ever played.If your getting this game your going to have to have internet connection to play.Also one player is not that fun at all really it mostly made for playing online. One bad thing is that you need a good graphics card but i have a Radeon 9800 Xt it works perfect. You should denftinely buy it i won all the battle field games.Good Work EA!
1,After the 1st episode....,this anime seems indifferent to me. It should be better to play lineage or something than whatch an anime who deals with characters in a online game. Can't say bad or good only that it doesn't interest me into watching the whole series...too childish maybe
1,Lame,"There isnt one song on this cd I like in fact i dont even like Aaron. I think the only reason he wrote a couple of pathetic songs and got them put on a cds is because he had connections from his brother Nick. If u like Aaron Carter,stop and if you dont like his dont start."
1,"The ""Andrew Dice Clay"" of political thought","This pains me to say this but... this is not a very good book. The major problem with Savage's arguments are that they're based on adrenaline and angst instead of facts that work. When he does make points that are true and accurate, they are usually so over-the-top and bombastic that it makes him seem uncredible. Not everyone that is conservative is this macho and what his book does is make the conservative movement look more angry than it actually is.If you are into books from talkshow hosts, get Hannity, get Limbaugh, get Marvin, skip Savage. He is the ""Andrew Dice Clay"" of political thought."
2,Works as advertised - just set your charge cycle properly,"Nineteen months after using this battery everyday, it's now showing some signs of wear. Occasional reconditioning restores some capacity, but from a high of about 2.5 hours, am now down to 40 mins per charge, all things being equal.I've modified the cycle, as suggested by the IBM Battery Maximizer app, hoping this will extend the life some more. Apparently, if you're plugged in most of the time, it's better to get the charger to stop at less than 100% capacity, and start recharging at below 90% capacity.Nothing wrong with the battery, really. It works as advertised. I just wished it would have lived a little longer."
1,OVER RATED!,I really don't understand what all the hype is with this band. They are mediocre at best.
2,Great Information,"It has only been in my late 40's that I'm discovering how to take care of my naturally curly hair. Years of growing up has conditioned me to try to straighten my hair and how unhealthy it had become from this process. This book has helped to free me from that programming and to really understand my hair and to love having it. Get this book, it is a must!"
2,Another great album,Andreas Vollenweider is a modern composer of original genre mor than just another new age musician. Taking classic themes and various cultural styles and blending them on a canvas to compose a new art.
2,The Wait is amazing,"ZOX's new album, ""The Wait"" is one of the most clever, interesting, and varied that I have heard in a long time. The songs on this CD jump from invigorating and foot-thumping melodies like ""Thirsty"" to sterling and sentimental, however not wailing, ballads like ""Carolyn"" and ""Anything but Fine"". The lyrics of Eli Miller are thoughtful and cognitive without being cliche or dripping with angst and with beats like these, it makes dealing with any downer situation seem easy and almost fun. The music is easy to dance, or sit back and relax to. Anything goes with ""The Wait"" and anyone looking for something that they've never heard before should buy it."
1,Humorous at best.,"I highly recommend this to anyone well grounded in LDS theology and who has a sense of humor. For those individuals, it will provide many hours of laughter. If you lack the former you will learn little, as it is biased at best. If you lack the latter, the out right lies, prevarications and falsehoods it contains will make you angry."
1,A poor picture of Savannah,"Scattered and often pointless, Midnight isnt entirely sure what type of book it wants to be or what message its sending. An occasional great character saves the book from total failure, but you are not left with any type of complete picture of Savannah."
2,Why the heck did this bomb at the box office?!?!,"P2 is quite the little film. I disagree with a reviewer that rated this a one starer, also stating that it was boring because it was in a parking garage.That's what makes it so brilliant! The setting was so dark and lonely, a metaphore perhaps for the antagonist of the film, Tom. This movie will disturb you because it can actually happen. Most horror films revolve around truly far-fetched notions, but this could happen to you.Angela, our heroine is great. She's smart and quick and gives Tom the persuit of his life.There is also a slight morbidly romantic tone to this movie as well, if you really listen to the dialouge."
1,Modem blues,"I purchesed linspire 5.0 expecting an easy time. But, I have the linux modem blues. I have sucessfully installed modems with redhat 9 and lycoris, but with linspire I am surprised to be having such hassles. A usb external wasn't seen. I yanked my pci modem and put in an agere chipset modem. Linspire sees it, but I get a 'no dial tone' window. I reboot witht the same computer into windows 2000 and the modem works fine. Really, if this is supposed to be such an easy distro of linux, why haven't they resolved this stuff? I find little information on the linspire web site. And of course, without a working modem, the cnr is totally useless! So, here I am going on to modem #3, scouring the web trying to find something compatible. Arrgh!"
1,Infantile Humor,"This was a bad movie. The action scenes were descent, but the humor was terrible. I am a Walkin fan, and I had hoped for something more. I was given infantile humor. Come on ... give me something funnier, than a really short guy running out of a bar during a fight. I have seen better action movies."
2,married at midnight,"It was a good book...I had read the other books in this series and wanted to finish all of them...I feel bad that I had to buy the book, but there wasn't any other option...I would have like to have read it from the library or on an ebook, but not available...I did what I needed to do..."
2,Just my style,These salt and pepper shakers are pleasing to look at. They function just as any shaker would. I made little pockets on my napkin basket for them.
2,Flawless,"Let me say I have been a tremendous fan of the boys from Hull for about 10 years now and have come to expect greatness (the exception being the B-2 remix album). This album blew me away.... This is Fila spinning other artists' tracks yet this album simply towers above other mix cd's including Fila's own Another Late Night....I have never wanted to review a product before, but after listening to this album I felt truly compelled to get online and let others know....you will not be disappointed"
1,unhappy with purchase,"I searched ,found and ordered Hella OVAL lights for my tractor. I had researched quite a bit and finally chose these OVAL lights to match the other ones on my tractor. Problem is the product doesn't match the description! They came as ROUND lights. So, I went to the John Deere dealer and ordered the OEM lights because you can't always believe what you are told on the internet. Buyer Beware!"
1,documentary? about what? 1969?,"I buy almost anything as long its not mainstream and hoped to learn about Australian cinema. Big mistake. Most of the time we see actors sitting in comfortable chairs and talking about movies and, yes, once in a while clips size 10 seconds moving along. Boring and most annoying was the fact they been talking about Australia some 40 years ago and as I am not historian writing thesis it makes no sense at all. The only thing I learned from long talking they dont have freedom of speech either and not happy about it. Sure, whatever."
1,just another cheesy glam band,"I heard about this band a lot, yet I never heard anything from them since last night. Let me just clarify a few things...this is no were near being ""metal"" or is this ""gothic"". This is a glam band that has taken thier love for The Cure, and Black sabbath to far, and turn it into crap. It seems as though mtv has done it again with another cheesy gothic band that is full of hot-topic trends. When I think about this band I think of AFI, Evanescence, Marilyn manson, Slipknot, and Linkin park, just a few of the trendy cheesy poser mainstream bands. Brain Hugh Warner (yes, this is the actual name of manson) has gotten other bands to try to fallow him in his foot-steps. He is the vanity filled, trendy, mainstream mtv ""goth"" [my face will be the by-product of my music] world. I like metal, and this is NOT metal. This is more punk if anything. This is pansy ""my family hates me"" ""my boyfriend/girl-friend just broke up with me, and I want to kill myself"" tenny-bopper music."
1,Incomplete!!!!!,"Even if the staging is quite good, and the singers are competent,specially the Lulu, one amazing singer, (the conducting is not remarkable ) be warned: this is a Two Act version of Berg's masterpiece. I can't understand why some people insists in doing one unfinished version of a work that since 1978 is very well completed by the Austrian composer Friedrich Cerha. Berg wrote the essential of the music of the third act. The third act, that isn't played in this DVD, is essential for the complete understanding of the work. The Mise - en - Scene kill the characters in the second act trying to explain the history without the real end. Don't miss your time and money. Go to the DVD recorded in Glyndebourne. There you will have a first rate conductor, a fantastic staging and a complete performance of this sensational opera."
1,Couldn't Get Past the Writing,The writing in this book was so awkward and clumsy that I really couldn't pay attention to the plot. Perhaps the writing did improve as the book progressed; I read half of it and gave up.
1,lacks privacy,the product is not that good. only blocks views from the extreme sides.I wish i could return it. it's really not worth the price
2,A saxman like this can converse,"My title comes from the second track on this luxuriously smooth-as-silk sax album by Kim Waters. That track, ""A Love Like This"", is a 4:37 piece of original soprano sax playing that is so lush that Kim has made it my favorite of the entire album. The depth of feeling that Kim transmits through his playing of soprano sax really gets the listener in a groove you never want to end.The whole point to the album is summed up in the title track ""From The Heart"" as Kim takes you along on a musical conversation that teaches the art of listening. This is a lesson we all can learn by hearing and re-hearing the beguiling ""Royal Groove.""While playing this CD you get drawn in to another world with romantic mood music that will put you in a healing frame of mind after a long day of whatever."
1,Garbage,"This is the worse software ever. I only wanted to copy a family video to another dvd. No user support, no online or printed help. The box it came in is more useful. I had to rate it one star but it was not even worth that rating."
1,not the same layout as print,"This is one of my largest complaints of the kindle system as a whole. This book is a dynamic book, meaning that the page is sized for the text. The problem with this feature is twofold. First, the parts lists are difficult to reference quickly. Second, a page cannot be referenced by page number (as is done in most lecture classes). It would be a great Kindle feature if you could choose between standard book layout styled print and dynamic pages (depending on your personal preference or quality of eyesight). Until then, this book is best bought as a hard copy."
2,"Precision milled - it fits 5/8"" arbors and 1/2"" arbors","Unlike other arbor converters this one really works. It comes assembled with a 5/8"" insert, an Allen wrench, and set screws. Remove the insert and the product slips on a 5/8"" arbor with ease and with zero apparent slop. Read my other review of one that does not fit 5/8"" arbors because they milled with no allowance. I highly recommend this product."
2,Simply Nice!,"...Such a fine piece of music. Mel, George and the producers are simply the best right here and now. I have played Bass since early 1950. This fellow . . . Brian Torff on the Bass, simply makes me happy. That's the way I might have played if I simply had the tallent that Torff has. You need a gift from God in order to play like Torff does.Thanks for still being alive!"
1,Just not a very good read....,I am buying these Paizo releases out of curiosity. I am just not very impressed with the Henry Kuttner offering. Elak and Prince Raynor are both very bland characters and the stories just fell flat and were uninteresting.
2,Definitive work on Emergency Incident Rehabilitation,"Whether you are part of a public safety agency, or just curious as to what ""rehab"" is, this book is for you! This book was instrumental in helping me plan a rehab sector standard operating procedure for my fire/EMS department. A must for any firefighter/EMT!"
2,SUPERIOR HORROR REMAKE!!,"IT'S NOT THE ORIGINAL, BUT IT'S NOT BAD. THIS ONE DOESN'T LEAVE YOU HANGING LIKE THE ORIGINAL AMITYVILLE HORROR...SO IN MANY WAYS IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER!AS FAR AS CAST GOES...THE ORIGINAL CAST WAS MUCH BETTER!!"
1,transportationnof item,"the item ordered was not expensive but I paid to get it quick and it took 9 days to get here. It was too late, but do to the price it wasn't worth returning."
2,My Favorite Mavricks CD,"I totally agree with the review I read a bit ago, you never know what to expect with a Mavericks album. AND if you like to group your music into different categories you may have a problem with this. It is not country for sure, I would say ""retro"" a bit. IT is a bit of a splash back to the 60's maybe. To me it is refreshing and enjoyable. This may have been their first CD but I can say it is my favorite. ""Foolish Heart"" I can listen to over and over and also ""Missing You"", musical genius at work here. They have created their own niche. I can bet you one thing, if you play this cd at a party you will get a lot of ""who is that?"". In short I like um and find it refreshing to put in this cd every once in a while, cleans the cob webs away."
2,"Works fine, but....",Does what I bought it for but I wished I'd looked around at my local big box store where remnants cost about the same and I was able to pick the color of my choice. Oh well.
2,Fusilli Drawer Pulls ~ A+++++++,The Fusilli Drawer Pulls are great quality and a great value. I bought the Satin Nickel Pulls to go in my kitchen...they look great against the espresso finish of my cabinets. Would recommend!!!
2,Real Cajun,I love the language and dialect used to write the book. I'm a Cajun and had trouble with some of the words but can remember my grandma and grandpa telling me stories when I was little and these are how they prounced things. It really took me back.
1,This book is trivial,This isn't chicken soup for the soul; it is barely a bouillion cube. There is nothing here. Just alot of obvious blah/blah about how life should be treasured because it is ephemeral. And Mitch Albom seems like an exploitative opportunist. I think the old guy killed himself to escape Mitch Albom's smug presence. Yuk.
1,Big disappointment,"This has to be the biggest disappointment of the year. The American chess darling has betrayed the entire adult and scholastic community by coming out with this book. Don't you think that a tragic blunder was made when the author constantly has to defend herself? This should be a once in a lifetime lesson. The author bashed just about everyone in this book, including friends and supporters of hers. She made her best friends Irina Krush look like a spoiled selfish brat and Elizabeth Vicary look like a sex digger. What people would write to sell a few extra books. Totally shameful! Totally selfish! Totally horrible! Stop defending the inexcusable!"
1,save your money,"Save your money and try something else instead. While this would likely work, and did keep me full, it has the taste and texture of pancake batter. Maybe I'm too sensitive but I couldn't even get it down."
1,"Rotadent not as ""advertised""",Rota-dent was highly recommended by my dentist. No wonder as he was selling it with his name on it and probably making a huge profit on it. But my unit did not turn out as advertised by the dentist himself. I was guaranteed that the electic toothbrush would work for a week on one full charge. Well it did for a while but in less than a year it was down to about 4 days and now it will hold a charge for two days. A piece of junk not even worth half the price. As for the replacement brushes? Don't even let me get started on that!
1,Swap Meet,Not a very good Movie but Cheryl Rixon was in it and She is one Sexy Lady also it has Me and My Cousins Eddie and Jessica as Extras lol !
1,The Worst ... I've Ever Read,"Evan Hunter has written some good books but not this time. You have to ask yourself why anyone would write a book about characters that no one would never want to spend a moment with, let alone read about...in a so-called plot that is depressing and irrelevant to most ordinary readers. This sad, dull book is replete with a lot of flashbacks of earlier years in the lives of the first-person ""writer"" and his sister, who is mentally and emotionally [messed] up. A lot of dialogue but nothing happens. In the end nothing happens. It takes a whole book for the so-called characters to decide to get help for the sister. Do not waste your time on this drivel. Wish I could have given it a minus-stars revue. Blah!"
1,"You can afford an editor, can't you?","There is nothing worse than a six hundred page book that could benefit from not just good, but ANY editing. It is incredibly annoying to have the same trite metaphor, or the same random fact (dropped in to demonstrate that the author is clearly in the know) repeated within two or three pages of each other....multiple times within the book. Sometimes, it appears that Clancy writes each chapter, and other than the basic plot line, completely forgets what he has written, and so uses the same literary devices over and over. Yes, it is an interesting premise, but the writing has devolved so far in the past couple of years as to distract from the story. Please. Please. Hire an editor, and let them edit your books."
1,Not a Thermometer,"I also bought this watch & spent extra money because it is advertized as ""Thermometer"". There is no thermometer on it. Very cheaply made."
1,wow,"i must be getting over the 2d platform genre or something, cause this game is just plain boring."
1,Fish die in this tank,"Your water will be sparkling, the gentle sound of the water wheel is relaxing, it's a beautiful tank, but you just can't keep anything alive in it! I have fish in mulitple tanks ( different brands )and they do beautifully, but anything I put in this tank is dead within a 2 month period. Crazy. This tank is not cheap, but there is something wrong. As I write this there is a poor fish gasping it's last breath in that stinking tank. I guess I am out the money because I will not put another fish in that tank only to watch it die a slow and painful death. It's a beautiful fishy coffin. If I sound ticked off it's because I am ticked off. Buy something else."
2,good running shoes,Comfortable and great cushion. I love it. Been using it for over a year now. Very durable.
2,"If you get one book on usability methods, make it this one.","I've found this book to be a terrific resource. It's comprehensive, practical and approachable. Kathy and Catherine take you through a wide variety of usability methods, explaining why and when to use each one. Highly recommended."
1,Need better size information before purchase,"This exhause tip needs better information on the size of the incoming tailpipe. My tail pipe is 3"" and you would think this would fit but it didn't. The internal dimension of this tip is 2 1/2"" so the tip would actually constrict the flow of exhaust in my case, and it couldn't even be attached with the bolt on adapters. The product itself is excellent if the correct sizing information was supplied so you could make an intelligent buying decision."
1,Needs some work,"It's not too expensive, so not too bad of an investment if you need a quick snack lunch and don't have access to a microwave or such. It does take 2 packets for a decent mug of soup, and you really do need to let it brew in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Adding croutons does help, but overall it's not that great-there are better offerings out there. I don't think I'll get another order, sorry."
2,Possible Mel second best film behind Passion of Christ.,"This one probably show why mel gibson was among the top actor yet only making a few film,s cause film feel like this prove the be worthly enought to earn oscar which i think it deserve, however i dislike some plot, yes the bloodly, maniac viloance is a bit over the top, but sometime just a bit over do, most cast of the film aren't doing good acting, just mel and the engliand king who really stand out acting rest is consider poor performance, so there's you having still one of memorable film out there even after decade is out."
2,"Not a review, but this will likely help others if a reply is received",Hoping one of the three reviewers of this product can help me out with info:Are these blades oiled or coated or not? Thanks in advance for any/all help!
2,Accurate description and good product,"I bought this product, after I saw in my friends place.This is very useful to someone who runs and exercises quite frequqently. This is effective and helpful. I would recommend trying it."
1,Numerous missing items,"This seemed like the perfect kit to bring on vacation -- light, fits in a pocket of my cargo shorts, and has a little bit of everything to handle just about any mild injury suffered along the way.Needless to say, when I popped it open to retrieve some ibuprofen today (the first time I've used the kit), I was a bit surprised to find that not only was there no ibuprofen: There was no aspirin, no antihistamine, no antibiotic ointment, and odds are I've missed something else which they left out.I guess when they call it a ""light and fast personal kit"", they mean it's light a couple items because they packed it fast.Very, very, very annoyed & disappointed."
2,A great place to start learning the art of flyfishing,"Since I was technical editor for this book, I may not be a completely unbiased reviewer--but I really do think Peter Kaminsky's book is a great place to start learning the art of flyfishing. The book is comprehensive,very clearly organized and written in an amusing, informal style that helps to de-mystify flyfishing. Peter also went out of his way to give warmwater flyfishing and saltwater flyfishing the space they deserve--so this book isn't just about trout and salmon. The information here will prepare you for tarpon in Belize, redfish in the Gulf, blues in Rhode Island or bass and sunnies in your local farm pond. I've been teaching flyfishing and flycasting for years and I now recommend this book to all of my students."
2,The Best Book Ever,"this book was one of the best i have ever read. if you're into fantasy, and even if you're not, this book is wonderful. It's told from the point of view of a woman, which is a big plus for all you girls out there. in fact, the whole trilogy is written from a woman's point of view. these books share the feelings that everyone goes through, love, loss, hope, and hopelessness. And it told a great tale of Ireland ( NOT Britain) and made it wonderful and magical. I would recommend this book, and the other two also."
1,MISLEADING,"Smith does very little to identify the entire story of social security. He fails to identify the ever increasing additions to the population that paid into the fund;(It originally included only blue colar workers, then as the fund got into financial trouble another category of workers were added to bolster the fund. The military was brought in in 1957 and federal workers in 1984 as the fund continued to get into financial trouble.) He puts all the blame on Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush and attempts to give credit to Clinton for trying to salvage the ponzi scheme. He fails to identify other fiscal impacts that impacted the national budget deficits. Essentialy poorly researched and misleading."
2,Really?,"As with almost all of Amelia books, I loved this one. BUT I hated the ending cutoff. Unless there's a sequel or something, that ending sucked with just leaving it like that.but great book."
1,Anachronistic,"Previous review writers have pointed out factual problems, and that as fiction, it isn't very interesting. What I found the most pernicious error was his character Simon, a Rabbi, mentioning G-d's name, which is impermissible in Rabbinic Judaism.His book Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages is a beautiful and at times helpful book, but is seriously lacking when it comes to Jewish and Arab writers of the Middle Ages. Clearly Dr. Cantor should solicit more assistance from specialists on Medieval Judaism and Islam before publishing his books."
1,Skip it,"This book was godawful. I always have a book in tow - sometimes serious literature and sometimes just plain fun and this falls into a third category: a complete waste of time and money. Stupid jokes, idiot characters, ridiculous plot...you're worth more than this!!!"
1,"Purple, Green and Yellow","I ordered Purple Green and Yellow for my Grandaughter. As a former Media Specialist I have read it to many kids and it has become a favorite. I was surprised at the $1.99 price tag but thought it must be a great sale price! NOT!!! It was a TINY little book, maybe 3"" X 3"". Not at all what I thought I was getting. I feel like I was duped! Thanks Amazon!"
1,Rusts inside!!!,"Oxo Good Grips Uplift Teakettle, Brushed Stainless SteelI bought the green enamel Oxo Good Grips Uplift Tea Kettle 2 Qt. capacity less than 6 months back. I use it daily to boil water for cooking. I take good care of it- keep it clean and dry when not in use. Unfortunately, it has began rusting inside where the spout meets the kettle. This is definitely not worth the money.2 stars for the good looks and the comfy handle."
1,Nostalgia is really boring...,"This is how war movies were made. Simple plot, low budget, repeated scenes from war documentaries and ending that is predicable. It was good to see Sterling Hayden in his prime. Good movie for a collector of old movies."
2,IT WAS A VERY GOOD ALBUM .,Well to beinging with I like them two guy s like the beats some of the LYRICS I dont like ... I FEEL STRONG about that it s realy right the way they speak SPANISH and ENGLISH . IF they would just use more positive LYRICS they would be the best LATINO HIP HOP CREW out there...........
2,"Handy for skis, bikes, etc.","Got this as a ski lock, but it will serve as a nice, easy to carry bike lock too. Great price!"
2,sign in book for party...,this book is quite large. I am going to use it as a sign in book for my son's 1st birthday
2,This book is best in its class on spiritual excellence!,"I have read this book many times over twenty five years. It gave added dimensions to my life as a Buddhist monk, and to my current life as a Christian minister. The book details a simple message of human sonship with God, as lived and taught by Jesus of Nazareth, and sets it against a backdrop of the enormous spiritual potentials that exist throughout all existence. I recommend it to anyone who wants more out of Christian theology, and more of what is beyond Buddhist enlightenment experience. At first the Urantia papers may be hard going, but if the reader persists and finds their own pace, the spiritual fruits will absolutely astonish and fulfil."
1,"Lights light, but adhesive tape is very weak","I purchased this product to provide light inside cupboards in my camper. I installed them per directions and made sure the surfaces I stuck them to were clean. I'm not sure if the foam double side tape on back of the lights was old or just weak, but they did not stay stuck, falling after only a few hours in some places and once they fell down the lights would come on and drain the batteries. The light was adequate for my use so I'm bummed they haven't worked out. I'm going to use some new double sided foam tape and see if that works better. I thought I'd really like this product, but as of now not so much."
2,My favorite toolkit,"I've had my Swiss Champ for almost 15 years and it's still going strong. You can't have too many multitools in your life, so I also have a Leatherman original and a Super Tool, a Gerber Multiplier original edition limited production run, a Gerber Toolbox, the Buck Tool, the SOG Switchplier and SOG Crosscut, the Bear MGC tool, the Al Mar 4 x 4, the Schrade Tool, and several other multitools, but the Champ is the one I use most.I had one other comment, which is that Victorinox's customer service is quite good. I've sent two of their Officer's model knives in for repair that had lost a scale or a scissors spring and they just replaced the entire knife. Those aren't that expensive, to be sure, but that was still nice of them to do.Another interesting thing I thought I'd mention is that under Swiss law, Victorinox and Wenger split all the contracts for the military and their other venues, so they're each guaranteed 50% of the various markets by law."
2,Belkin Transfer Cable,This worked well to transfer files from XP to Vista--the problem was it was it was a slow process.
1,I absolutely hated it,"It's actually the worst movie I've seen in my whole life. I'm a great film lover -the kind of person who can't afford to miss a movie whether European, American or Ethnic. The Lady and the Duke reminded me of old school performances. Pathetic."
2,Wish I'd had this set earlier!,"I've noticed my 15 month old daughter has more luck eating with stainless steel silverware than she does with plastic baby cutlery. I decided to get her this little set to encourage her to feed herself (which she tries so hard to do), and I wish I'd bought it way earlier! These are adorable, easy for a toddler to use, and sturdy. They clean up easily, and look nice. What's not to like? The 6-piece set is also good value because you get pieces that grow with your child or multiple children. I only wish we'd bought it 6 months ago! Much better than plastic.By the way, my family grew up with the Paul Revere adult-sized cutlery set, and my parents still use it to this day. It still looks great. Very high quality, stainless, and strong after 30+ years of use!"
2,Just go buy it.,I can't say enough about this dvd. It's excellent!! If you are a Zeppelin fan you will not be disappointed.
2,ceramabryte scraper,This tool is small for nice storage and use. The razor or sharp edge works perfect on my flat top stove for scraping off burnt on stuff before I use the rest of ceramabryte prodects to clean it. The razor appears to be replaceable.
2,The Diversity of Clint,"The guy can do anything extremely well. The many hats he wears in this business has proven that.Despite the tragic loss of Walt, the story was good and left an important message. You can always count on Clint to never disappoint."
1,Brothers and sisters,I have not received this item yet and was wondering where it was. Im very disapointed as I alway receive them on time please send this asap
2,So Far a FIVE,"I just received this product in the mail, after some research and deciding to purchase fitness quest. I wanted something sturdy, compact, and quiet. For only 84 lbs its quite sturdy! I'm surprised. It works best on hard flooring but very doable on carpet too. if you're super tall, I don't recommend you get this as its stride is 15"". It works for me as I'm 5'4"". The assembly was very clear, and came with extra lubricant for the joints. Super quiet! Reading reviews, I found that experts recommend rear motiion vs. frontal. Much more natural. I'll post an update if anything changes, but so far I'm very pleased, and again, pleasantly surprised."
2,Crouching what???,"First off your not gonna get any crouching tiger hidden dragon references from me because other than the 4 or five great fighting sequences i didnt care for a love story, im sorry thats just me. For my money Iron monkey was a better movie and Storm riders tops the both of them. The fight scenes were plentifull and the story was just right for my taste the only problem i had was i didnt get a chance to see this movie in the theaters with the sounds blairing off the walls."
2,Great Purchase,"I'm a tea newbie so after fiddling with tea bags, tea strainers, regular strainers etc. I knew there had to be a better way! This basket is great! I use mine daily and it strains out even the finest leaves. I use mine without the lid, and use the lid upside down to put the strainer in when I remove it from the teapot. It's very easy to clean, and overall it's been just perfect for me. I'll never go back to the mess and fuss of all those other strainers!"
1,This is not worthy to be called an album!!!,"Okay, I'm a make this short and sweet... This LP SUCKS!!!!!!!!!! Big Time. Don't waste your hard earned dough. Go get a Wu-Tang album. Thank You."
2,five stars!!!,one of the best toy storages i have ever had. Very compact and spacious! I'm going to order at least one more.
1,DIRE,What a pile of Crap! Old has beens.About as heavy as feathers.Retire with your mega bucks and leave metal to the newer and more imaginative bands.I cant believe people used to fight to get ur stuff off Napster what a WASTE of useful internet time.THIS ALBUM [is waste.]
1,A POX on Adobe,"Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0/Premier Elements 3.0 [LB]I recently re-installed Photoshop Elements 4.0 and the newly acquired Premier Elements 3.0. My computer technician had advised me to uninstall Elements 4.0 several months ago since we were both having severe problems with my computer (operating system Windows XP Pro). I followed his advice, and after many hours of his time, he was able to clean up my computer and make it functional. While I followed his advice, I did not feel that the Adobe program was the source of the problem. I was determined to use the product. When I was able to acquire Premier, I installed both programs. Possibly a co-incident, but both DVD drives became inoperative, and the AV program would no longer function. Several hours were required to correct this situation. Who knows what mysteries lurk with the computer, and I realize that others are using these programs with various degrees of success. I cannot give a rousing recommendation."
1,No support for Mac,"This looks like a fun game with a really reasonable price. Problem is, on my iMac running 10.6.8, the game does not start! Even worse, my requests for help, on their website as suggested, and by email, go ignored. I printed the manual as suggested... no help. I went to their forums as suggested... they were in a language I don't understand. On one help page, someone complains about this issue, and is told to use a wired mouse... no help there, as I'm using a wired mouse. It seems that the hardest puzzle one must solve is how to start the program. The price may have looked reasonable, but I feel ripped off."
2,Two classic chamber works from great talents,"The contents of this CD are:Gabriel Pierné: Quintette (Piano Quintet)Guillaume Lekeau: Quatuor inachevé (Unfinished String Quartet)Belgian composer Lekeu, who died young, left only the first two movements of his string quartet, but they were his best work: engaging, dramatic and musically ambitious. Pierné's quintet from 1919, a more understated but more confident work, comes off just as well here. Both receive quality performance and recording."
2,Bob Acri is awesome,I regret that I am only just now discovering the music of Bob Acri. I have played this CD over and over and still it takes my breath when it begins. Beautiful relaxing and listening music.I plan to purchase more of his CDs later this week.
1,the new model is not as good: issues with wide feed,"The blades are sharp, and it has a powerful motor, but the new ""lid system"" is totally unacceptable.To use the wide feeder (which is a bit wider than the standard feed on the older models), you have to cut the item up into 3 inch lengths. It is not possible to feed 10 inch carrots, a long block of cheese, etc., into the wide feeder without the ""pusher"" being on top of the product and locked into place.The new lid system to be used with the grater/slicer has many interlocking components, and seems more bulky than useful. It also seems likely they will break over time.If you are not likely to use the grater/slicer often, this is a perfectly good product (and you can take advantage of the feeder-less lid).I'll be getting the Braun food processor instead."
1,"If you care for your Iphone, do not buy.","I'm very dissapointed in this case. I bought it and the 3rd day of use, the belt clip detached from the case and it (along with my iPhone) fell to the ground.Now I have a dent on my phone on the top corner where it is not protected. I trusted Belkin's products but not anymore. I thought $30.00 would be sufficient to protect my $500 phone but aparently it is not. Go elsewhere. I went back to using my Cozip case.If I could give this case a 0 out of 5 I would."
2,Bouncing fine!,"I am not a professional and these balls are good enough for recreational sport.And even better! Giving really good response to the force you apply, hitting them and bouncing pretty fine. Not too expansive."
2,This Is GREAT!!!!!!,"This movie was soooooooooooooooo incredible. The special effects were amazing. And Peter/Jeremy is soooooooooooo cute. And here's where u guys will think I'm crazy (which I am) but I think Hook is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo HOT!!!!! Yep, I'm crazy. But anyway, u have got 2 see this movie. Besides POTC, this is the best movie of all time, seriously. Oh, and by the way, I DO, I DO, I DO BELIEVE IN FAIRIES!!!! AND I BELIEVE IN U PETER PAN!!!! MY WINDOW WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN 4 U!!!!!"
2,Awesome!,"The music is awesome! It's not the same kind of stuff you'd hear on a Happy 2b Hardcore CD (Moonshine, [same company]), but it's still great! If you like Happy Hardcore you'll like this CD!"
1,A Poor Imitation of the Sensational British Horrible History Series,"It is a disgrace to blatantly copy a successful idea and an even bigger shameful act when what you produce is no where near the same high quality of what you ripped off. The Horrible Histories series was groundbreaking in making history more entertaining and interesting especially for young readers and this rip off of that idea (History Horrors, a title obviously designed to come up in the same search as Horrible Histories) does not have the same high quality of illustrations or information that Horrible Histories does. Reward the pioneers who took the risks and came up with the ideas and buy the much better books from the Horrible Histories series instead!"
2,"he's definitely ""one of the best""","a very balanced album. There's a song for different kinds of moods, I like most 'til it bend,me & ounu and try offa yah, these are great for weekend parties. There are also great songs for quiet moods; songs like lonely night and Don & Dupes which I play over and over 'cause its briliant."
1,not too good to be bought...,really i dony know why a ringtone must be on a cd...i am pissed of this ding ding ding from this stupid ''annoying'' frog...
1,Ugh and double ugh,"I recently had my roof replaced, and afterward had to clean up the scraps of asphalt shingle left by the workmen. Had this snack bar been dropped on the ground among the trash, it would have been hard to spot.So, the Pure blueberry bar is not appetizing to look at. It isn't good to eat, either, presenting a mucilaginous binder holding together some not very crunchy nuts.It's appeal, if any, must reside in what the manufacturer claims it doesn't have: no refined sugar, no preservatives, no trans fats, no cholesterol, no dairy, no GMOs, no gluten and no soy. Since I don't object to any of those things, it has no appeal for me.I wouldn't eat one again, and my wife didn't like it either, so one star, but check also my review of the Pure cherry bar, which she did like."
1,Do not waste your money.,"Mine broke after a month and neither Logitech or where I purchased them would back them and now I have broken junk,I have since purchased the new Koss Colbalt bluetooth headphones that are only on the Koss website for now and they are twice what these are,and have a lifetime no questions asked warranty on them.The colbalt are better sounding and have better range and they also come with a computer bluetooth usb audio dongle and USB charging cable, AC charging adapter, and audio extension cable and the Bluetooth audio transmitter,also they can work with bluetooth cellphones that play music like the Razr V3x because they have a built-in microphone so you can take calls.They are the best!"
1,Hopeless,"This scanty little volume barely even begins to get to grips with the complexity of Rosalind Krauss's writing. It gives the impression of something David Carrier knocked off on his vacation, completely lacking in any rigourous engagement with Krauss, and full of vacuous comments like ""Hmm, Rosalind Krauss is often controversial, but she is always interesting!"" Well, thanks for that Professor Carrier, you should really do a lot better than this. Krauss is barely even quoted properly either, for some kind of legal reasons mentioned in the preface. This contributes to the lack of seriousness which characterises this slim and ultimately unhelpful study. And what's more, it costs $90!! You would be completely out of your mind to pay that kind of money for this book."
2,Solid,"Solid phone - inexpensive, works well. If you have the vtech system, this is a great choice for adding a phone where it's convenient - not where you have a phone jack."
1,Stick With Martini's Other Novels,"I'm afraid I don't agree with the other reviewers. This is not the Martini I've come to respect. If you're about to read your first Martini, start with another book."
2,Hangman,This was a great toy that made it much easier to play hangman than constantly writing on a piece of paper. What I didn't like was the letters as they seemed difficult to manage and were not so durable.
1,Waste of $100,"Like many of the other reviewers, I have experienced the same problems. At first the steamer appeared to work O.K. However, it soon began to leak steam from the hose and became very dangerous. Today the cap seized and would not come off. The entire unit turns when you try to turn the cap. I will call the company tomorrow, and if I am not satisfied with the response, I will file a complaint with the State Atorney General's office."
2,Exactly what I always wanted....,I looked long and hard for a breadmaker. I researched and researched for many months to find one that would fit my way of life and here it is. This machine not only makes bread but it also makes flavored butter and desserts I was amazed! The bread comes out perfect everytime. I use it atleast once a week sometimes more. My family loves all the new creations I have made with it. Now we can enjoy breads and desserts that are made with healthy ingredients not stuff you can't pronounce. I wanted something that would give me the power to bring in choices in our lives and this bread machine did exactly that and then some.
2,There is more than meets the eye.,"This book gives insight into film editing like no other. the other reviewers said that the book did not really help into any actual editing technioques in real life, well perhaps that is why there are NO actual ways to edit. With today's editing suites, you drag and drop, cut, and you're done. What Walter Murch is giving you are lessons that go deep beyond that. How to tell when a good cut is there, when the emotional moment tells you to cut, how to recognize it. If you want to learn a jump cut, or editing tricks, then pick up something else, but if you want to learn how to recognize the story in your film, and how to tell it in the way that only you can, then pick this book up, and read in between the lines."
2,A Must for Newhart Fans,"I have LP's, CD's and Cassette tapes of every known Bob Newhart Stand Up (OK, Sit Down) routine. Collected them for years. Even sent a complete set to an Arab Sheik in Qatar. And just found out this DVD is available. If you like the original, before TV series, Newhart and you cannot catch one of his increasingly rare live shows, get this DVD. Classic Newhart, refined by age and experience. Buy a spare for a gift. Well worth the price!"
1,This watch is TOO BIG,"When people say this watch is big.. they mean REALLY BIG HUGE. Did I mention this watch is a Gigantic Super sized.. MEGLADON? This watch makes my SUV look small. Don't try paddling a kayak with this watch on unless you like making unintentional left hand circles. Additionally, the tidal feature is worthless for the Texas coast."
1,Scanner is completely unreliable,"This was a big disappointment to us. We've always insisted on HP printers in my company, and thought that their scanners would match the printers quality, but that hasn't been the case for us. This scanner is used on a daily basis for numerous small multipage jobs. It randomly stops communicating with the computer it is connected to, requiring IT support to visit on an almost daily basis. It is far too unreliable for us to continue using it. We are in the process of replacing it with another brand."
2,Very useful,"I found this book to be very useful to me. The author presents a positive, upbeat prespective of the oppurtunities and challenges presented by the Internet."
1,Bad Choice,"Of the ten songs on the album, only two are the original versions. The others are either by different artists (Splish Splash, Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport) or are bad remakes (Tiptoe Through The Tulips, Aint Got No Home, etc.). I recommend not buying this junk."
1,unbiblical garbage,"The feel good generation is at it again. You can't do anything wrong. Perfect book for our humanistic, politically correct society. Mr. Walsch, that was Satan answering your questions."
1,Very poor quality,"Nobody buy the balloon animals kit because it doesn't work. It wouldn't make into shapes, and it was super hard to blow up. When you twist them, they pop, or they go back to normal. And the directions were not very good.Jonah, age 7And we were so excited.-Mom"
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this book looking for some stories about players, about the game of baseball, about the human side of it. I bought it for my son for his 11th birthday. I bought the wrong book. This book is NOT appropriate for anyone under 16, and not for many over 16. I'm sure many players use profanity, but almost every story had more than enough. One story led up to a player and his girl going through the trauma of a backroom abortion (where is the baseball in that?), another ended with the picture of a player sliding headfirst into home to be greeted by the batter, a malevolent teammate with a grudge who slugged his face with the bat. Looking for junk story writers trying to be cute or brutally realistic? Fine, this book is for you. Looking for good baseball stories? Look somewhere else."
1,"Not up to ""The Deed""","I thoroughly enjoyed The Deed of Paksenarion, but I cannot recommend Liar's Oath. The story's weak and Laup is an unlikable, uninspiring character that reminds me of a government bureaucrat who's not happy in his job but doesn't have the courage to do anything else. Gird's character, isn't around long and I never really had a sense for the purpose of the book. It isn't good enough to stand on it's own merits and I didn't find it a particularly good precursor. The book ends with a resounding fizzle and even Paks and Duke/King Keri can't save it. I haven't given up on Ms. Moon though. Her extraordinary narrative added so much to the wonderful story line in The Deed. Unfortunately in Liar's Oath it's not enough to save the weak story"
2,Christmas Lights 2,Looks to be a Christmas season favorite to help get one in the mood. It's amazing to see what some people will do to celebrate the season.
2,better than we expected,"Wanted a small stool of decent quality. Easy assembly, and unlike one review, appears to be quite solid. Pleased and would recommend the item."
1,A Walk on the Ugly Side,"While this movie is well-acted and produced it suffers from a basic flaw: its storyline is unremittingly ugly and depressing. Its portrayal of each character's dark side continues inexorably and without relief. Little Children may be considered a modern-day tragedy, but there is no catharsis. When this dismal and overly long march concludes, my reaction was not ""The End"" but rather ""Thank God it's over."" In my opinion, stories like this just leave a bad memory about disturbed people doing disturbing things best left in a church confessional or a psycho-therapist's office. Putting the underbelly of suburbia's privileged few up close and personal is not, in and of itself, a good reason to make a movie. On the upside, this movie is perfectly made and convincingly acted. Unfortunately it is not a story worth telling."
1,Not enough story... too much filler,"I normally love anything by Bendis but this book just doesn't have enough story to qualify. There's a lot of filler material about the villans. Heck, they even put in mock chat logs from IM conversations. Usually when I read a book, it's got words only. If I'm reading a graphic novel, I like a little bit of art. I'd say this book is half art and half plain text. Or dossiers on heros and villans. And that gets old after the first 20+ pages. I'd skip this one next time."
2,Tyler strikes again!!!,"Tyler Perry always out does his self. I am a writer myself. My novel is called ""Marley's Angels"" so go check that out on barns and nobles and [...]. But as a writer you have to be very creative and keep your audience on their toes. And the movie "" Why did I get married"" is even better than the play. Yeah that's hard to believe but that's the truth."
2,A deeply moving game... another worthy Squaresoft title!,"Finally! This game is not a sequel to any of the Squaresoft titles before, but man isn't the story original! The story would get you hooked to the game, especially during the beginning part. The music ... excellent! Not too repetitive, and always heard at the perfect situation, drawing the excellent atmosphere. The gameplay... great in my opinion, although I like FF7's better, it is still great as long as you take the time to get the hang of it. Graphic is something you won't miss as you play through, amazing! You'll see, I wish I have some screenshots, but oh well. The game's long, that's why it's fun, you get to understand more about the characters and plot. It's worth the money for 40 hours of playing time."
2,Its hard to find a great pair of working tweezers,"These tweezers work great, I have been searching for 15 yrs. for product that satisfied me. I have tried probably a dozen pairs and none seemed to last very long or allow me to get ahold of my fine facial hairs that grow wild where I least expect them to be. The older I get the harder it is to see and grab them and the more I seem to be getting them. It has a comfortable grip to it, which is also important do to my authritis in my hands /I am so glad I bought 3 pair, for home, for travel, and I gave one to my mother as a suprise (she likes hers too) yes I would buy this item again.Tweezerman Stainless Steel Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze"
1,Disappointing,"I waited patiently for years and finally they put out a new album. I was a huge fan of these guys because i believed ""Fallen"" was a great album. When their guitarist left i thought it was a big deal because his lyrics and musical contribution itself was a big part of this band. But the guitarist of Cold, another fav band of mine, took his place. So i thought at least they found a good replacement. But when i heard the new single i was somewhat disappointed, it was okay but it still wasnt even as good as the worst song off of ""Fallen"". This new album is different from the last one and you can feel the emptiness in the music without the old guitarist. Even the new lyrics are somewhat repetitive. I thought about giving this album 1 star but at least it had 4 or 5 decent songs."
1,The complete collection of Sex & the City,"I was charged $127 for this on Dec 9,2010 but my mother did not receive the order. I will report this to my credit card company and Amazon.com."
2,Pricing Changes Quickly...,"At the time that I purchased this boxed set, it was $54.99 for Seasons 1 through 4...not sure why it went up so drastically, but I'd definitely watch this if you're interested in purchasing it...hopefully it'll come down in price again soon!"
2,A Journal of Love and Healing: Transcending Grief,WHAT A BLESSING AND IMMENSE HELP FOR MY DEAR FRIEND WHO IS EXPERIENCING THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE.
2,Nothing But The Best!,"After buying the Greatest Hits compilation around 5 years ago I was very impressed. Every song on this CD is great!! Its so hard to narrow down a particular favorite. With Steve Perry's soulful voice and john cain's extraordinary song writing Journey became one of the most successful bands of all time. No wonder they have received a hollywood star. With nearly 80 million records sold, and now there greatest hits has sold 14 million copies!!! They are simply unstoppable!Now all we need is the original lineup with Steve Perry and man would the arenas be selling out fast!"
2,COUPON ORGANIZER,"HI,THIS COUPON ORGANIZER IS REALLY HELPFUL, ITS COMPACT, FITS OVER THE CART HANDLE, AND HAS BEENVERY USEFUL WHEN I AM GOING SHOPPING.....ITS LIGHTWEIGHT, SOFT TO THE TOUCH, AND I REALLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE THIS TYPE OF ORGANIZER, AND THE PRICES ARE RIGHT...I ALSORECEIVED THIS VERY QUICKLY IN THE MAIL....."
1,don't buy from Amazon unless you love wasting cardboare,"I will say upfront that this is a review of the packaging, not of the product. The bed is fine - inexpensive, thin, and it sheds, but it's great for scattering around the house for dogs to nap on. Just don't buy it from Amazon! This bed is 30"" long by 21"" wide, and about 2"" wide at it's widest point. It could easily have been folded up into a small box. Instead, Amazon chose to ship it flat, in a box that is literally 24"" wide by 36"" long by 13"" deep. The box was so big that UPS would not leave it on my porch - they denied delivery 3 days in a row, and I went through absolute hell trying to get it finally delivered. This is a commonly stocked item at pet stores, so find someplace local to buy it and save probably a whole tree's worth of cardboard, and a whole lot of stress."
2,A surprise,"This wasn't what I was expecting, but turned out to be so much more intense and interesting. If what you're looking for is a bunch of tips there are plenty of other books that will give you that like Lou Paget and the other sexperts. This is really a look inside the male mind and how they approach sex and where their fantasies and fears come from and that great sex is more than knowing how to perform oral sex. It's easy to think from She Comes First that that's what this book is going to be about, but really it's just a small piece of a bigger idea. The book is a little dense in places, but it's also really friendly and I think it's unique to hear a guy talk so openly about what's really going inside a guy's head when it comes to sex."
2,A must have,"For any consultant, in any field. Block speaks about the heart of consulting work, not only the mind of it."
1,Tired of old grind,"I have had this grinder for 13 months and it stopped working this morning, Dont waste your money on this. My daughter liked the look of this machine. Don't let the looks deceive you. Poor quality."
2,"Love it, would rather buy a new one than wash it though","great ""k""loth. They're so cheap, I don't know why you'd risk washing it to trap some dust into the Kloth instead of just buying a new one, but that's just me. I use it for up to a year and just get new ones. As the kloth gets more and more used, you can potentially scratch the item you are wiping (maybe I just wipe too hard)"
1,What??????????,"Okay, I am a fan of Judas Priest....that's why it pains me to do this. Apologies to all the Priest fans out there but I have to give this CD 2 stars....as another person mentioned in their review, this album does have its moments and I myself gave it a chance....I played it once then had to listen to it again. However, final verdict for me is 2 stars......this is just mediocre. The Judas Priest I know is the 'You've Got Another Thing Comin'' from the CD ""Screaming For Vengeance"" and 'Some Heads Are Gonna Roll', 'Jawbreaker' from the CD ""Defenders Of The Faith"". I don't know what to call this group here but it's not Judas Priest"
1,I wish I could return it,"I had high hopes for this book. Good title, decent reviews.I have some basic sailing experience, so I expected to learn quite a lot, but to my surprise although the book has over 200 pagers, it is very basic and common sense information."
1,The worst Stephen King book ever,"I don't think I have ever been so disappointed with a book. I was expecting a ""Return of the King"" epic finish to this series I have loved and longed for completion. Instead I received a disjointed, incomplete, schizophrenic tale that answers few questions or gets us any closer to the Black Tower. I think it would have been better to leave the series unfinished than conclude with this poorly written, weak ending. I may not even even read the last book. PS: I think King's writing journal at the end of the book is pathetic. Does he want us to feel sorry for him? One thing is quite correct though -- his career ended when he was hit by that truck. He hasn't writing a decent sentence since."
1,???,"I tried to check the information in the book on the people I know and could not find that the information applies to their character. This sure tells that the information cannot be generalized, which puts the book in the ""not needed store"" as far as I am involved. I did not gain any knowledge from it and I cannot understand how the information was arrived at. It is not applicable to reality at all."
2,If you're looking for astronomical calculations you won't find them here,"I bought this book after it had been recommended to me as a good source for understanding how astronomical calculations (sunrise, sunset, dawn, dusk, etc) are made. While the book does go into some basic astronomy, the sought after calculations were not there.Still, for someone seeking to understand the Jewish calendar on the month level, this is a good text, well written and accurate. While I personally already had this knowledge and so it was not useful to me, anyone looking to understand the structure of the Jewish year would find it very helpful."
1,It's ok.....,"This is not the best cd, definitely not the worst. Maybe I haven't put enough time into listening to this cd, but it didn't really capture my attention. It's pretty monotonous. I pretty much listen to it to hear the song about the hooptie that's on one tree hill, and number 6. that's about it. That's a good waste of 13 dollars, if you ask me."
1,NEWBIEES,"I gave it one star because I know when I read reviews I look for the lows and highs...and since there are like 65 highs...Lets go with low. Well 6 months ago I was a new swimmer could barely do 1/2 lap @ 25yards without sinking or sqwaking like a chicken, but at any rate I get this book. Which dont get me wrong is a great study aiddddd. But at the end of the day if your a NEWBIEE what works best for some might not be all, so your going to need a trainer. And if you need a trainer like I did, save your money and get an instructor. If you got money to blow then by all means as this book will make a great addition to any library or even coffee table for that matter!"
1,Cook Once? When?,The title of this book implies that the author will help you do a big cookfest on the weekend and then store it for the week. This is just another cookbook. Wish I hadn't wasted my time.
1,Disappointing,"Obviously, most readers of presidential history know that this is considered perhaps the most controversial biography ever written.The book has its decent points and does give a lot of insight into Reagan's life, but the reader must always remember that its Morris' view of Reagan's life--via his fictionalized characters--and thus could be viewed in a fictionalized light.I guess my overall view is that Morris, in spite of other great works he has delivered, really let the American public down in the first ""authorized"" presidential biography.There's no doubt that Ronald Reagan was an incredibly private man. That being said, there's probably only one person on the face of the earth who ever got to know his heart and that person will never ""kiss and tell""--Nancy Reagan.Morris could have done better."
2,Great fun and great read!,"This book has all the info on getting yourself into the world of James Bond! well wriiten, nicely laid out along with great art work!"
1,"Disturbing, tasteless, lacks anything redeeming","I like super hero movies, so the trailer for this one totally hooked me.The first ten minutes, setting up the premise, continued to hook me.Then came wave after wave of senseless dismemberment and murder, often at the hands of a disturbed 11 year old girl.In the end, I'd say the movie was tasteless, it had plenty of shock-and-awe-via-violence-and-gunfire-and-decapitation, but lacked an actually inspiring character, an actually moving story-line, or anything else that balances such portrayal of violence to actually uplift you ~ the way you often feel uplifted at the end of a super hero movie. Nothing like that here. I was just left disturbed.If you have kids of a conscience, or a love of good movies and inspiring human stories, stay away from this one."
1,Can't get through it.,"Started reading Jack London lately and really like his work. This is way different from the London that I am used to reading. Very boring. No excitement. Must be another side of Jack London, but I'm not interested. Can't get past the the first four chapters. Don't think that I am going to try anymore either."
2,Beautiful set!,"I have been looking for years for a Thanksgiving dinner set that didn't cost hundreds of dollars! This set is beautiful! It has a nice weight, dinner plates are on the small side...but heck...thats what seconds are for right?! The teapot is darling! Serving pieces are great! All you need is the gravy and the platter and you have dinner! Also, you cannot beat this price...ANYWHERE! Check E-Bay, Replacements, etc. You will not find this set at this price anywhere else...believe me, I have checked..and free shipping! Buy it..you won't be sorry!"
1,Electronizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Avant perhaps, but not exactly hard. This is spacey electronica, dull and slightly annoying. Good to listen to when stoned or sewing."
2,Hong,"Actually, at first I was a hesitate to buy the ti-81. Finally, I had made the decision to buy it. I find that it's worth every penny. I love it. Trust me, this calculator can do almost everything like the ti-83, except that it doesn't have as much memory as the ti-83 and the ability to transfer info. However, I find that the ti-81 is every easy to use. Not bad at all!!"
2,Imitation is sincerest form of flattery,"I'm writer Charles Panati, and after years of adoring TRHPS, and countless viewings, I've just published a Kindle ebook, a novel of psychological suspense, based on the TRHPS and titled THE ROCKY HORRORS. In the novel, a page-turning thriller, the cult flix is central to a series of bizzare murders, and the killer's identitly - and motive - are to be found in the movie."
1,Chicken Little wrong again(as always),"Ehrlich has made a 40 year career out of being flat out wrong.Every prediction in this book failed to come to pass.For some reason that is beyond me he manages to keep a good reputation,especially from radical environmentalist kooks and scientists who are greedy for grant money who will latch on to any alarmism in order to get those dollars rolling in.Ehrlich and Rifkin and the whole pantheon of the doom and gloom preachers are a discrace to science and deserve nothing but scorn for poisoning the public discourse and knowledge with their modern brand of apocalyptic thinking.But deep down a lot of people desire that an apocalypse is right around the corner.Whole religions have been founded on this type of thinking,like the hardcore environmentalist movement of present day America.Like all doom and gloomers Ehrlich will be forgotten 50 years from now,but of course a new generation of Chicken Littles will have arrived."
2,spiritual ascent for Stockhausen,"Stockhausen explains in the liner notes that composing this piece was part of a very spiritually moving experience for him in Aztec ruins. He liked looking at repeating forms ruins that were slightly out of phase, & for me, this music is alternately the slow grass, the carved stones, & the clean air. This whole vocal piece moves fluidly with a basic structure of repetition & electronic innovation. The music, too, is so unique! Stockhausen really is an incredibly, amazingly creative person, a great composer. This piece, with its own personal sense of coherence, is different from much other work of his."
2,Great product!,"Fits wonderfully and works great with a maxi pad. Would not recommend using it without one, as it doesn't absorb large amounts of urine. Soft t-shirt material comfortable to wear and doesn't cause sores from daily use. Stays in place. Heavy-duty Velcro. Outlasted other brands I have had in the past. Recommend having several at your disposal for the leg-lifter in your life."
2,A Lady Detective,"This book was delightful to read. It has the flavor of Alexander Smith's Ladies #1 Detective Agency. I wonder if he read this and got the idea to begin his series. It's also a ""feel good"" story as Maisie goes from rags to middle class independent women which is unusual way back around WWI. It's part historical fiction and part mystery. Maisie is intuitive, smart and resourceful.I think you will know if you like this book by the end of the first chapter. It's first in a series and I already have the next one."
2,Fantastic,"What a fantastic movie. This movie brings together The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man stories (plus a couple of minor super heroes) and delivers non-stop action, and lots of humor, giving the viewer a wild and entertaining ride. Loved it."
1,lousy quality control,I order and then had to send back and reorder a 2nd which i am sening back after 3 days different problem each time it seems like it is just like most stuff made in china u r lucky if it works for a week I really would like to find one that is good quality but I assure u this is not
2,Great Book,I love this book. I think it is fun to read and learn and also full of several different coins that will keep you searching and collecting for years. I think this is a great purchase. My daughter loves putting the coins in the slots.
1,"Great Brush, Below Par Scrubbies","I use my grill A LOT, and I also purchased this brush based on the America's Test Kitchen review because I was tired of the brass bristle brushes not cleaning well and the little bristles sticking in my fingers when I cleaned the inside of my grill.The brush itself is great; the angle of contact on the grill grates is perfect for cleaning...it hopefully will last a long time. The brush does do a better cleaning job, however, the scrubbies are ""Tool Wizard"", not ""Grill Wizard"", and they come apart after 20-25 cleanings."
2,Super Neat,This is the best night ever created! Awesome in a room 3 different colors and it is bright. It also has a cool feature that shuts itself off after 45 minutes. The bad thing is its not a plug in so it might go through batteries fairly quickly but worth it for how neat it really is.
2,Auch - Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye,"Auch drops his debut, KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE, a clicky, glitchy album that pulses and throbs. The tracks have a certain iciness to them: ""Black Snow"" has a reggae off-beat but still evinces frigidity; ""Until the Red Fog Rises"" swims in an abstract ambience until the beat finally kicks in. But the warmth also comes in slowly, creeping into ""Pick-Up"" and adding some bright electro flavor to ""Sleeping Dogs."" ""Double Indemnity"" has enough thump to work the dancefloor, and ""Fast Run"" has an aquatic feel to it. ""Frankfurt Connection"" has a denseness that fades into minimalism at the end, while ""The Glass Key"" chugs turgidly as a tugboat and ""Clandestine"" goes subterranean. Cool and mysterious."
2,gods word,this is visual reading of gods word and I love itIt helps me visualize the book of Luke correctly
2,Perfect Portable Acoustic Stand,"I have the Acoustic and Electric versions of this stand and both of them are great. Perfect for travel they take up very little room when set up. The size of the arms was the perfect size for my Epiphone Classical guitar and it felt snug and secure on the stand. My acoustic/electric guitar has a thinner and more round body and was much more shallow on the arms, but this made the guitar stand taller (which was actually very nice because it took up less room since the neck wasn't leaning backwards) but was still secure and stable. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an inexpensive guitar stand that is light and durable.PROS:-Light and portable.-Compact.-Stable design and construction.-Holds all types of acoustic guitars.CONS:None for me although the acoustic/electric extra arm length may be a problem for some."
2,Lladró on Amazon? Now I've seen it all!,"Just for fun I looked around the room and plugged in a random item or two, and this came up! I had no idea Amazon sold Lladró porcelain.Although we received this as a gift some years ago, it is still a current catalog item (Issue year 2000, Nao #02001350). You can order it direct, but the shipping would cost $22.""My Little Bouquet"" is a beautiful piece of art. The subject matter and delicate coloring make it a perfect wedding present. Sculpted by Marco Antonio Noguerón.What else is there to say? I am still flabbergasted this is on Amazon. Not just through a Marketplace seller, but ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com."" I wonder: does it drop ship from Spain or did Amazon acquire some quantity of these for its warehouses?What's next here? Buying a car? (Maybe.)"
1,Disappointing,"Given Lucie-Smith's vast experience in the field, I expected a more definitive work on the male figure in the history of art. I found it to be much short of that. The scholarship and the illustrations just don't measure up to anything like a seminal statement on the subject. In fact, there are many instances when the choice of illustrations is inexplicable. This is not a book that I have kept for my art library."
1,emerson jug kettle EM83691,"This product is a bigdisappointment...both my sister and myself purchased the Emerson Jug Kettle, hers lasted two weeks, mind two uses...l would like to have the address of Emerson so l might return it to them...but, l cannot find one !!!!"
1,P Shoulda Kept His Mouth Closed,"Awful! Just awful! This shoulda been released as just an instrumental album, and even then it'd be pretty bad. I liked the NERD stuff, but this thing is a waste of all that aluminum . . . ."
2,Just what I was searching for,"I am very pleased with this purchase. It was just what I was searching for in a weight scale. I would have liked a few more extras, but performs as intended."
1,Never again,The color is terrible. What should be yellow is green; there are green shadows printing on my pics. Won't buy these again; terribly disappointed in the quality.
1,re-chargable batteries.,"My 1st 3 T,V, Listeners were perfect..easy to use great tone and light weight... When something is not broken why do they go and change it?? Regular batteries worked just fine.Buying a pkg. of them lasted longer and cheaper. With this one you are forced to use re-chargables..."
2,Happy with my purchase,"This vanity works for me. The width is good for my bedroom. I hesitated for a long time in buying the set because I had doubts. I needed something sturdy for an adult. I didn't want anything dark or too small like for kids, but after reading some of the reviews, I decided to purchase it. I'm glad I did, it's perfect. I was also concerned about the stool, but not to worry, it's also very sturdy and wide enough for a woman with big hips as a lot of us have. I'm enjoying my vanity now instead of when I was young. Now, if I'm tired, I can sit while I doll myself up. The color isn't exactly off white, it's a bit darker but still works. Assembly is easy and it's packaged with care. I really like ordering through Amazon."
1,Don't buy the Kindle version,"If you must be told to get out of debt and save and invest, get the print version.Mostly it's full of testimonials so, if you need the ""if they can do it so can you"" encouragement, here it is!The publisher obviously thinks that NO effort needs to go into reformatting a print book for Kindle.The entire last 20% is forms which can't be printed from a Kindle.While reading along you'll get ramdom quotes that are from other parts of the book.You've been warned (it's not like they're the only ones that have a Kindle formatting problem so beware)."
2,best show,it just keeps getting better and better. great balance between comic and original content to keep both sets of fans happy
2,"An absolute, unconditional endorsement for this classic","An absolute, unconditional endorsement for this classic by Winn Rosch, a certified computer genius. This book is all substance, unlike the confused trash and filler cluttering the (real and virtual) bookshelves today from people who received an A in Freshman English and happened to end up working for a computer magazine. I am truly awed by the breadth and scope of this work. Bravo, Winn. A bonus is the CD-ROM which includes an additional 700 pages of archive and background material which did not make it into the hardcopy edition. Compare it to the throwaway shareware garbage that passes for a CD-ROM volume in most computer books today."
1,Vulgar and not funny at all,"I ordered the first season based on the reviews and since I am always hungry for good comedy. I watched the first three episodes before returning the DVDs. This product should be rated XXX!The vulgar language and total lack of any moral standards was more than I could stand. I cannot imagine how anyone could find this boring garbage funny. Larry David had nothing funny to say so he used vulgarity at every opportunity to try and attract an audience. If you like to listen to foul language being used to describe the male anatomy and sexual activities in general, then this trash may be for you. Many scenes in the first three episodes dragged on and on even though there was nothing going on besides some boring dribble between Larry and his wife.Do yourself a favor and don't waste any money or time on this trash!"

2,"The Secret""","I purchased a DVD and book the same name for each of my children and my sister because I had excellent comments from a client that it turned her life around. I felt that my children and sister could benefit from it as they had been experiencing some setbacks in their life. Even though I am a family therapist, I try not to give advise to them, but the book and DVD provided all the information they could want in taking care of themselves and their lives. I read the book and watched the DVD and thought it gave some excellent information about not blaming others, but taking responsibility for our lives and making it work..not really a secret, but one not discussed openly."
2,Wonderful collection of stories and inspiration,"This book is a wonderful collection of stories twisted out of a lifetime. Seed (& Euro-Seed) have set out a story of a person's life... and delivered it through a series of anecdotal true tales. If I did not know this person and recognize a number of the actual stories and characters, I would assume this book to be in the fiction section... and besides, who could argue with someone who uses the words ""cancerous leper"" to describe a ""friend""!Nice work. Great, fun, laugh out loud (and cry in private), reflection on life, love, and friendships...Cheers Seed.Rick."
2,Difficult To Imagine This Could Go Unnoticed...,"The Rape of Nanking is a bitter episode of human brutality, and it's difficult to read the chronicle without feeling twinges of remorse and horror, even more than 55 years later. The suffering pressed upon the Chinese by the Japanese invaders is harrowing, yet at the same time, oddly compelling; one wonders what could have propelled these soldiers and officers to commit such unspeakable crimes. That the majority of the perpetrators were never prosecuted by the United Nations is unforgiveable, especially in light of film footage and other damning documentation provided by American missionaries and--believe it or not--a Nazi named Rabe who lived in Nanjing at the time. Self-possessed Japanese citizens to this day deny this event ever occurred, despite the evidence to the contrary. This is perhaps the last insult added to injury...that so many thousands could have perished unnoticed, and that the aggressors know no shame for their actions."
1,Idiotic product,"I expected this to plug into an inside USB port, doing the obvious by giving me more of everything. That would be a terrific way to freshen up an old box. I was stunned to see that it came with 4 USB cables intended to snake through the box and come out the back through an open plate. Then I was supposed to plug these four cables into ports magically available on the back. Completely idiotic - have they never heard of something called a hub?As soon as I saw the cables and the installation diagram I packed it up and returned it."
2,granite solid power metal,I went and found this album because I love Rob Rock as a vocalist and have enjoyed everything he has sang on. Didn't know he sang on this until recently. Dude............it rocks. Awesome chunky metal riffs in your face. Great production and of course great vocals. No nu here this is modern heavy power metal. Not super fast but as solid as it gets. If you like Rob's solo stuff or his work on Impelletteri or just superb power metal hunt this down. Why is this hard to find? More talent here then any of the joker bands wearing masks. If it's not available here check out Rad Rockers. (can i say that here?)
1,This shouldn't even be for sale!,"I think an elementary school student put this DVD together. Boring boring boring. The editing is crap, the games on screen don't correspond to the written scores on screen, the music is bad, etc.. etc.. etc... I bought the whole package toghether (Volumes 1,2,3,4), and I exchanged them all because I thought mine were just messed up. Well, I got the new ones and they were exactly the same. Unfortunately I got them from another vendor which didn't accept returns, just exchanges so I'm stuck with them."
1,Not what you want,"This may carry the Schrade name but it isn't the one you want. It is a cheap version, the blade isn't as good and the scales (handle) is much softer than the original. It isn't bad, just not what I expected. The package says ""Made in China"""
2,Good effects,"While it is not Disney's best, it was entertaining and had very good special effects. Good story but may be a little much for young kids with the deaths and such."
2,compact wallet,"Nice and compact, easy to use. The leather is very soft and I am hoping will stand the test of time. Zippers work seamlessly and overall I am very happy"
1,Burned my face,"I wanted to try this but it burned my face, I have really senistive skin and ezcema so i would not suggest buying it"
2,Naval Ha-ha's,"Well, I did read this book repeatedly in the late 50's and early 60's, so I cannot in good conscience rate it lower than 4 stars. It is a moderately entertaining, and by now quaintly old-fashioned, story of some admen pressed into U. S. Navy Public Relations service in the Pacific. While everyone else fought the Axis, they fought the Air Force for their fair share of public recognition. The funniest bit is where the PR guys launch a ""Typical Young Navy Man"" campaign and select their candidate sight unseen, merely because his name contains two famous naval historical figures--Farragut and (John Paul) Jones. When he comes ashore for briefing, he proves slovenly, foul-mouthed, and all but intractable. The movie version memorably bleeped out his every use of the f-word with a ship's horn that sounded every bit as foul as what it was masking!"
2,well-made drums,"These drums are some of the nicest ones I've ever installed on a car. Their appearance is spectacular, and the quality is perfect. No cleaning was required; they just install right out of the package."
2,I'll take two please,"I read many reviews giving a bad rating to this item because of drive failures. Yes, there is a chance that your external hard drive will fail. Lacie has no worse a reputation than other vendors (or no better). My advice: buy two drives, and setup a mirrored volume. Both Windows XP/Vista and Mac OS X support this. This is the best guarantee against a drive failure: when a drive fails, you won't lose a byte of information. I've been doing this for years, and never looked back. Peace of mind comes at this price.As for this particular drive, it works perfectly, it's fast and quiet, and the Firewire interfaces offer outstanding speeds."
2,Fantastic! It's a must-have for girls!,"I hated razor, tried shaving but it did not work for me. Shaving made the hair grows thicker and faster afterwards, plus the roots are impossible to be getting rid of. After reading the reviews, I ordered it to try, I used it for once and already fall in love with this. I used to use small tweezer to pluck out my leg's hair, in order to avoid the razor, it took me a few hours to do that but this super electronic tweezer works wonder! You won't see the black roots and I have smooth and silkly legs in 20 mins. It does not hurt at all, if you use it on your legs. But, if you use it at your under arm, it won't be a pleasant feeling, of course! I will never use anything else besides this for hair removing anymore! highly recommended!"
2,The City of Lost Children,"The City of Lost Children is a wonderfully strange dark movie that just blew me away. I prefer the French version. I find that I get distracted if the dialogue doesn't go with mouth movements. I loved the setting, filming, special effects. It ranks very high in my list of really great weird movies."
1,HO Train,"I was very disapointed in this item. It fell well short of what I expected. Even with the discount, In my opinion, this product is way way overpriced. The picture of the item on the web page was very misleading. It would have been nice if The web page had a more elaborate description to include the length of the item. I needed a HO Locomotive right away to use pulling our train around our Christmas tree. Amazon was very convenient, shipping was free and time was short. Item did arrive before the expected delivery date. The Locomotive was an HO but I had a constant problem keeping it on the rails especially when the train went through turnouts. When used with an assortment of various HO railroad cars the Locomotive looked to small and just didn't blend in at all. Since we only run the train at Christmas I will be shopping for a replacement before next Christmas."
1,an immoral moral,"If you're a normal girl, skip this book. Although cleverly written, the moral of the story is: If you are thin to the point of being unhealthy & obsessive--you'll get the guy. For shame."
2,Great Saw,I use this saw every day and I love it. It's convenient to set up. It doesn't have a really large over spray so I can use it in tight spaces. The rollers are still working well after 15000 sq ft of tile. The motor runs strong. I have no complaints.
2,Savory Second,"Arturo Perez-Reverte moves seamlessly between past, present, and future. I savored the second in the Alatriste series, which features a rematch between our hero and his arch enemy Malatesta as well as the horror of Inigo's chilling imprisonment. The evil machinations of the Inquisition are of particular interest as our government debates the legality of torture.My favorite sections of these books are the sly verses by poets who served as the Jon Stewarts of their day.And I just can't wait for the 2006 movie with Viggo Mortensen - from Aragorn to Alatriste!"
1,Really??,$15.99 for the Kindle Edition of this book is obnoxious. Why?? Why is this priced so high? Greedy publishers.
2,Vinyl Replacement,"If you have fond memories of a band way ahead of its time but just can't see yourself replacing your every album with a CD, then this is the disk for you. A decent sampling of their most popular tunes with a few odds thrown in there for fun. Techno? Electronica? Devo did it first and did it best."
2,I have read the book that provides an excellent insight.,"William James Durant is a gifted historian. His remarkable insight into the various cultures did influence my way of thinking. History is, in my view, a wholistic subject. One needs to have a very broad perspective of the whole scenario. I found such imprints in the book by Will Durant. It is a masterpiece and I hope that the future generations will treasure this book."
1,Almost completely useless for Games!!!,"This book is all but usefull. It basically gives you the math to implement OpenGL/Direct3D in software, but gives near to no details on using theses libaries to make cool games. The only part that was applicable to a game today imo was the shadow and lighting section. The shadow was so short on details that it was useless in the first place and the lighting part is the reason why this book gets 2 stars instead of 1. If you want to learn the internals of a 3D engine, I would even go as far as to suggest Andre Lamoth's book . If you want to know how to use math for a game in today's world and not back in 1990, then forget about this book. Plus, it's cluttered with proofs. A lot of pages are wasted proving that something is true."
2,a real classic,Now this is something. YMO remain a personal favourite even though they have released some stuff of really varying quality I must say. However this is their best disc in my opinion and ranks up there along with early Kraftwerk as a pioneering work of modern electronic music. It is also the least eastern (even if in some instances mabe thier most!) of their records and therefore the most understandable. YMO were apparently huge in Japan which one can understand. All their records have something that you can recommend them by. The only problem is that these japanese imports used to be hyper-expensive at the time. But they were definitely worth it.
2,Baby Sassy Seat,This was the perfect baby seat for us! It allowed our son to sit with us when we eat and he loves to eat his food with us instead of sit on the side like he used to. It's easy to set up and clean up.
2,Excellent but...,"This is an excellent DVD. I however was expecting what I had seen a few years back on PBS. In that version there was far more tension between Carreras and Bernstein. Carreras, whom I believe had just found out he had leukaemia, walked out in the middle of rehearsal after Bernstein picked him apart. Although there is not all that tension present in this DVD, it is still a good look inside the making of this recording. Watching the performance of the singers, musicians, and Bernstein is a far better treat then just listening to them on a CD. I do believe it has been whitewashed by removing a lot of the tense moments which is why I didn't give it 5 stars."
2,About Co-op play,"The reason I bought this game was the co-op play. Co-op is Wargames: Defcon 1 strongest suit, it's what's really terrific about it. It very open so you and you're friend can think up alot of tactics togehter, me and my friend were up all night playing this game together. When you really think about. there's not too many co-op video games out there today, and the few that are suck! So I highly recommend this game as a co-op game to play!"
2,Weight without being dull.,"Ford's short stories are weighty, without being dull. This weightiness does not derive from any complexity in concept or even character, nor does it derive from prose which is complex. Rather, there is a wealth of detail in terms of what the characters are experiencing. The common subject in this collection is marital infidelity."
1,I could never get into this book.,"Perhaps it was just the professor, but I could never get into this book. I think its hopelessly boring, and like alot of graduate textbooks in astro, it has a TERRIBLE index. You can't find anything you need in terms of numbers or equations with the index, you must read the book cover to cover to know where something is.It also has way too many numbers scattered in tables, and you must read the chapter to know what assumptions were made when he calculated those numbers. Our entire class had such a difficult time with homework using this book that I doubt any of us would give a good review of the book.My own research is in AGN, and for the most part he does OK in explaining them but he can confuse you in comparing them."
1,"Messy, messy, messy","I really liked the concept but after having these for several months I am disappointed. They are very messy, especially with spices such as cinnamon, clove, etc. I am constantly cleaning the holder and the container."
2,Perfect!,"Perfect! Easy to build, looks great! I have two other blond mission style pieces from different manufacturers in the same room and it matches perfectly. Very happy with the price and looks."
2,Perfect solution for credit cards falling out.,"This wallet has solved the problem of credit cards falling out. Normally, a wallet will start to lose the ability to hold credit cards as leather gets stretched out, etc. This wallet has a zip-around feature so nothing is ever going to fall out. It's also very slim... a perfect 5 star from me!"
1,The Bad Outweighs the Good,"This could have been such a wonderful book. The prose was elegant, the story was intense and everything came together well.Except for the fact Buzz Bissinger has a vendetta against sabermetrics and sabermetricians. The attacks on the book ""Moneyball"" and the flipant remarks attacking others (like me) who love the game was sickening.I would avoid this book and look elsewhere for that ""summer classic."""
1,"Run, Freedom, Run ... Then Run Away!","This cd's got one good song (Run, Freedom, Run) and the rest is stupid!"
2,Just that little bit of copper makes the diference,The handle on our old saucepan decided to break off in the middle of heating up some chocolate. Always wanted a copper saucepan but was too cheap to get a full copper pan that we would only use a couple of times a month. Great price and it heats up very evenly and quickly. Able to get milk to a full boil quite a bit faster too. The handle isn't the most comfortable but is a nice affordable product overall.
1,2ND TIME AROUND.......NOT A CHARM!,"Jennifer Lopez is definitely doing her thing and holding the industry down...in her own way. What can I say? She's a business woman who is -----> getting her paper! BUT, this CD is complete garbage -----> ...! .... Don't get me wrong, the beats are hot; but her range is TERRIBLE. Ms. Lopez is not a singer and never will be. The best she can do is carry a tune. Her tracks desparately need background vocals to balance out her high pitched shreiking. Save your money ...!"
1,"I'd like to say I like it, but...","I'd like to say I like Boondock Saint II, but i just bought the metal case special edition DVD and i cant get it out of the damn ring thats holding it down and i dont want to break the movie. What the hell do i do?"
2,Great album! Get it!,"If you should buy only one album from the late 70's punk era this is it. Smart, energetic, heavy. ""Enough Time"" is one of my all time favorite tunes."
2,Fantastic Product!,"I have only written a few reviews... too little time. But I am so pleased by this product that I will make time.This product includes the USB cord AND software. (Some companies sell each product separately... )What a success!My cell phone is Sprint's Sanyo PM-8200. Works perfectly at home and office with Windows XP and Outlook. I've transferred pictures, updated and backed up my contact list without problems. Reading and editing outlook appointments on the phone has been less optimal due to phone limitations. However, the software product works.The price was a bargain, considering that other stores, i.e., Radio Shack, several on-line stores... were much higher... nearly 2x the price I paid at Amazon.Although I have only one Sanyo Cell-phone, I was pleased to read that I could connect up to ""five"" different phones. Anyway... this product works. If I lost the software and USB cord, I would buy this product again."
2,"""She Don't"" have to worry. She is on her way!!!",Do your thang sexy! Super solid solo effort. Glad to see her again in the public eye. Was always my favorite memeber of Destiny's Child. Makes you wonder though. How long before the DC reunion.
1,I didn't like this movie at all.,"I have read the book and watched the movie... I don't like it... yet I liked the notebook, and I did like Miley Cyrus at the time she made this movie, so I wasn't a hater of her then... I just can't catch onto this movie... Actually... I kind of knew from the beginning I wouldn't like it. The only reason I went and saw it was because my friends kept ranting to me about watching it. Thankfully, I watched a library copy, so I didn't waste any money :) Smart move huh :) Anyways... I was only half into the book... Like I kind of liked the book, but it was hard to stick with, and then just went to see the movie and I hated the movie, and now can't stand the book :( Sorry Nicholas Sparks :( Movie production ruined your book for me, although was only half into it in the first place... I was really into a few other Nicholas Sparks movies/books though... ""Nights of Rodadanthe"" ""The Notebook"" ""A Walk to Remember"" I just don't think that this is one of the best..."
1,slinky crystal radio,Winding the tuning coil was critical and ridiculously hard to do. Assembly of the cheap parts (toilet paper roll) and single plastic folding form was tough to get to stay fixed once assembled. Never got the radio to work although it did pick up some static.
2,"Smiles, Laughs, and Pleasures!!","I have seen this movie many times, and it makes me laugh everytime! Just looking at the cover makes me smile because I remember parts of it! Yeah, so what this movie doesn't really have a point? Why does something need to have a point to it any way? Why can't there be more movies out there that have no point and you can just watch and laugh and have a good time!? My advice to you is buy this movie and watch it and laugh because that's what I'm gonna do! :) Hope you like it!Enjoy!~E.P.M.~"
1,Mucho ruido y pocas nueces,"Es una lectura entretenida y hasta ahí.La mínima ambientación histórica para hacer el relato fluido, el facilismo de la Inquisición para truncar personajes repentinamente, una buena parte del libro es la ""transcripción"" del alegato del protagonista en el juicio al que se lo somete.Y a partir de allí el argumento ya no es tal, sino una larga, laaarga nota al pie.No espere demasiado el lector."
2,very visible,targets are very visible at a distance. its like having 5 targets in 1 with this grid style target. also great for sighting in firearms. great buy. much cheaper than in stores or at ranges.
2,Soulful Howl-ing hits the right chords,"IMPORTANT: I had originally purhcased this album upon its release, and sadly, it was lost during my cross-country move. Still 5 years later I found myself humming tunes pulled from the edges of my memory. An album long lost from my possesion became a clawing obsession, until I finally realized the source: HOWL!With driving melodic tracks and a few nitty gritty numbers, ""HOWL"" appeases the soul. Don't expect to find any long solos or hard power-chord derived riffs, instead you'll find a soundtrack that will haunt you with its cathcy meoldies and tell a new story with each track. Each song will find its way into your mind, and make a happy home. Enjoy!"
2,An Intriguing Approach,"This anthology builds up the character of Dax (the symbiont)in all the forms shared with the various humanoid hosts. The concept of the Trill as an alien is in keeping with the best science fiction so both my fourteen-year-old son and I shared the reading of this anthology. The stories were enjoyable for both of us and each contributed to the overall development of the central character. Some of the stories were based on specific incidents referenced by Dax in the DS9 series and others were tied less closely to the show. At any rate, this is a very successful and unusual approach towards Star Trek commercial fiction. Suitable for ages 12 and above."
2,Good read,"I loved this book. This is the only book I've read by Noire, and I was quite pleased. You will finish this book to the end."
1,BEWARE! THIS IS NOT THE GARBO VERSION,"As the illustration clearly shows, the Cliff Notes version is the one starring Vivien Leigh, not Greta Garbo. The single star rating does not apply to the quality of either movie, but exists to call attention to this mistake."
2,"If you like NWA or Dre, BUY THIS","This CD was released the same day as the Beastie Boys' ""Paul's Boutique"" and both were hip-hop masterpieces. The D.O.C. had the best flow ever. ""The Grand Finale"" itself makes this a must-have for any West Coast fan."
1,Doesn't work for me at all,"First of all, I have to make it clear, that I purchaged PhosFree in my local store instead of Amazon.This product ""PhosFree"" totally doesn't work for me. It damaged my DE filter completely, so I have to replace whole set of DE filter grids, spent about $200 to make pump system work.""PhosFree"" blocked my DE filter when I used it in first time, even I extactly followed the instruction NC provided. When filter was blocked I consulted their customer service, was told that I can try Commercial version of ""PhosFree"", I trusted them and tried it, but it was even worse. My whole pump system doesn't work at all, whole pool was covered by green algae after 3 days. I called a poolman, he told me that he has other 3 customers have same problem, there is only one way to resolve it, that is to replace whole set of filter grides.I strongly suggest DO NOT use this product ""PhosFree"" in your swimming pool if you are using a DE filter."
1,third edition should be on kindle,I bought kindle so I wouldn't have to lug several heavy textbooks around. I still have to because the third edition of this book is not available on kindle... editions change and I need to be in-sync with my class to be academically successful
2,Keeps me on track!,"I had been looking for a pedometer that seemed substantial, so many of them feel cheaply made and don't seem to really count steps accurately. I have been really happy with the Omron HJ-112. Although is not small, it does fit into a pocket easily or attach to my waistband and is not uncomfortable to carry.I love that the HJ-112 keeps track of miles walked, steps, and calories. The fact that it stores 7 days worth of data is so helpful. This little device has really helped me want to stay active and strive to walk more every day."
2,great deal,"I bought it on sale for only 18 dollars. fit perfectly. great for a long walk , very comfy."
1,why oh why does anyone play this,"Yes this has good graphics, Yes it has a kind of Zelda theme. But really if your looking for a game that fits the Lord of the rings best then get the Two Towers. Once you are used to that then get the The Return of the King. That is the best game of them all. Ive played all three and the Fellowship is by far the worst game i have ! Please Gameboy dont let Vivendi Universal (the makers of this game) ever make a game based on a film ever again. They wasted away all the good parts of the books and if you want to fight on this game then good luck to you. DO NOT BUY THIS ITS A WASTE OF MONEY !!!!"
1,What a disappointment,"As a big fan of Faye Kellerman I was really looking forward tothis book being published. I bought it the day it came out. I washugely disappointed in it. It wasn't interesting, it wasn't well plotted and I was saddened by her choice to denigrate the Mormon faith. I have really loved reading her Rina Lazarus books and learning about the Jewish faith. I have respected the character of Rina Lazarus and her devotion. So I was quite surprised that Faye Kellerman could show such a lack of respect to another faith. It was also factually incorrect, in one scene she describes a Mormon girl at her first communion wearing a cross necklace. Mormons do not celebrate first communion, and they never use the symbol of the cross. Did she not do her research? How difficult would it have been to find out? It makes me wonder about the rest of her facts. How sad."
2,Superb!,"This is a stunning piece of scholarship, essential reading for anyone who seeks an understanding of these late-medieval queens. Laynesmith's research is extensive, and she writes in an engaging manner, proving that academic history can also be accessible history. Other historians I know rate this book very highly. I eagerly await a biography based on the author's PhD. thesis on Cecily Neville."
1,Smells like mothballs,"Got my cart - easy to assemble, but smells like mothballs. Not a little bit, a lot. Enough to make my entire apartment reek of mothballs."
1,Meh,"I read this book when I was in my 20s and I loved it, so I figured I'd refresh and go through it again. Let's just say, it didn't hold up well for me. It felt like basic info that every human being should be somewhat equipped with anyway. I guess I was looking for something more concrete and this felt like the opposite end of the spectrum. I also wasn't interested in the religion excerpts at all. Really, it just bored the hell out of me the second time around."
1,Don't Believe The Hype- James Blunt Is Bloody Awful,"I saw this guy performing on Oprah and I had to immediately change the station. James Blunt sounds like a dog with emphyzema. I don't know how anyone can just sit there and listen to this guy sing the same thing over and over again with *that* god awful voice. His music is utterly boring- it's not groovy, it's not funky, it's not jazzy, and it definitely doesn't rock. This guy isn't `deep' all. He's just being over emotional and his lyrics are corny and repetitious. James Blunt needs to lay off the blunts and disappear as quickly as he came. Hoolllllaaaaa!"
1,Crap,"Seems I have the same problem as everyone else. You would think a company like this would care for their reputation and craftsmanship. Apparently they care for neither. Wish I had read the review before purchasing. Apparently they know it is a problem if their solution is to hit it with a hammer. Now I have a huge piece for crap good for nothing. Will not every buy a Sentry product again, and will tell everyone I come into contact with to do the same."
2,Page Turner,"This is the second book continuing Tim Rackley's adventures after his involvement with the vigilantes who double crossed him and cost him his career with the US Marshal's office. This time he gets involved with a cult based outside of Los Angeles. I could not put this book down. I was happy that Rack could continue to heal after his daughter's murder by putting his energies into rescuing poor little Leah, who could not leave the cult on her own. Great book! I am now reading The Troubleshooter, which is the third book in the series and just as much a page turner as the first two books. I love Gregg Hurwitz books. Great, fast and exciting reads!"
2,HARD HITTING / HIGH ENERGY,"For those late 80's early 90's people that like hard hitting glam rock metal,this is your album.Strong vocals,great gutar,quick pounding drums and some great ballads.This album is a must for your collection."
2,If you love the Golden Age of travel...,"The book and labels are fantastic! I purchased some old luggage, applied these labels, and had instant, vintage luggage! The labels are great reproductions with vivid color. The booklet has a lot of information on the history of luggage labels and the Golden Era of travel. A great addition to any collection!"
2,awesome stand,this is great product for my needs using USB LED desk lamps... the base could be a bit heaver and i would love to have 2 usb outputs on top...
1,What a disappointment!,"I can't figure out why some reviewers can't make a difference between season 4 and the 3 previous ones... Frankly, all i found here was a poor scenario with predictable hooks and mellow love scenes. As a previous reviewer stated, stop at season 3 and u'll be fine!"
2,Great Mystery,"My 75-year old mother loves these Joe Gunther books.After reading the first in the series for free on kindle, my mother has been getting me to buy the rest of the series.She bought the first one after she finished Sue Grafton's ""Alphabet Mystery Series"". If you love the ""Joe Gunther"" books and have not read Sue Grafton, she is well worth the read. See the first in her series:A Is for AlibiIf you are looking for exciting adventure books for kids / teenagers, my mother recommendsJake Johnson And The Half Bloods (Quest 1) (Jake Johnson And The Greek Gods)and its sequelJake Johnson And The God Of War (Quest 2) (Jake Johnson And The Greek Gods)"
2,A Disturbing And Important Book,"We will all have to deal with sickness and death in all of our lives. I have often found myself trying without success to imagine Kristan Ryan and her dealings with ms, John Penn fighting 2 battles at once - cancer and AIDs, Hortensia Anderson and a life on a dialysis machine. All because of a book I bought on the suggestion of a friend with fibromyalgia. There are many lessons to be learned from STORIES - I have had the privilege of a life not yet touched with sickness. But all of the poets and writers in STORIES by disclosing theirs, humbles me. STORIES is not at all preachy - the purpose seems simply to wake us up and make us aware. This, it does without technical jargon nor self-pity. STORIES is a heart-wrenching and truly elegant book."
2,Answers,"I just wanted to clear up the reviewer who gave this 3 stars because it didn't have full-length versions and was it was mixed. It was done in the form of radio show, thus the blended music/interviews. Also, it was difficult to put the full-length versions of the song due to the limited space on the CD. Some of these ol' school joints were 7 minutes long! However, the vinyl lover was not left behind as the full-length versions, minus the interviews were available on record. Thank you for the positive review."
1,Never received product,I order a book on 5/27/10 and it is now 7/06/10 and I have not received my order. I don't know what else to say.
1,Microsoft Fluff,I would have to say that the author is strongly biased in favor of microsoft products. I think his overemphasis on using templates to create forms that can only be used by MS Internet Explorer was a major disappointment...
1,Refund due to Viewers,When I first saw this movie at the Theater I wanted to demand my money back. How anyone could find this movie entertaining must have went to school on the short bus. This movie has definitely hurt Jean Claude's career. The material was terrible and Lela Rochon's talents were wasted. Don't waste your time on this movie.
2,Ellington's Three Suites,"I own a lot of Duke Ellington CDs and albums, and this is one of my favorites. My favorite songs on here are Duke's version of the Nutcracker Suite. That was the main reason I purchased this CD. The other suites are fine, but Duke's Nutcracker highlights his creativity as an arranger."
1,Ugly Wreath,I just received this wreath. It looks nothing like the photo. It looks cheap. I can't believe the price for this. It's not battery operated so I can't even hang it on my front door. I am very disappointed. I will be sending this back for a refund. This is all I need during this time with everything else I have to do.
1,Depressing Monotonous story,"Got it off the donated book shelf at the library at least they got 50 out of it. Horrible that an editor allowed them to use the title of a wonderful Bible story for this decidedly uncharitable book. Waste of my time. Kept at it thinking something would happen to uplift the main character. Not! Simple sentences and as depressing as Hemingway. Yes, real life is often the same day after day but this story grinds it into you with no relief and then nothing is resolved."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"With a 2.5 inch foam topper, my mattress is 14 inches deep. This cover, which identities itself as queen size, probably measures an exact 60X80 when stretched and may fit mattresses up to 22"" deep BUT I seriously doubt that it will retain these dimensions after a wash.The top does cover the top of the mattress - barely. The sides do cover the sides of the mattress but there is very little extra fabric to tuck under the mattress. I think the claims of fitting a mattress much deeper than mine are very exaggerated,The quality is fine...all the threads are where they should be but I would have preferred a bit more generosity in terms of fabric - both on the top and the sides - and would have been willing to pay a bit more for that.It's worth the $20 it costs....barely."
2,awesome product,"arrived on time, no damages in shipping and the work out is killer! I love it ~ and I'm a fitness instructor! This work out is for ME on MY time..."
2,Defective Product,"La Crosse Technology WT-3122A 12 1/2-Inch Wood Atomic Analog ClockDefective Product. Love the quality appearance and construction. Installed on wall easily. Time set quickly and properly and kept perfect time until ""sprint forward"" time. Clock set to new time properly and worked for some hours, then the hour and minutes hands began to advance as if to reset time again. The only way to make them stop was to take out batteries. But they started back up again when batteries were reinserted. The same thing happened with my other La Crosse atomic clock purchase through Amazon Sep 2011. Likely some internal logic flaw."
2,Moisturizing,After putting this on I forget about my dry winter hands for hours. I just wish it came in a lager size and with a better cap.
2,Can't live without these,"I use these when I read, to mark pages for quick reference. Between highlighters and these flags I can quickly find what I'm looking for in a book."
1,Disgusting!!,"Wally Lamb has not written about a woman. In fact he hasn't written about a person. Instead he has created a victimized, spiteful, unhappy creature who has no heart or soul. Why should we care about Delores or any of Lamb's characters in fact, when they are so cartoonishly drawn. And repulsive too. Not one good apple in the whole mushy, slushy barrel. What makes people hate as much as these people do? Has their world really become so rotten? Scary thought."
1,Too buggy to bother with,"This game reminds me why I switched to console gaming. I troubleshoot computer problems all day. The last thing I want to do when I get home from work is to troubleshoot a game.I played the game without patching it and it worked fine except that I couldn't even get through the tutorial because the magic user's menu didn't provide the option to cast an offensive spell.I applied patch 2 (which is 1 and 2 combined) so far so good. When I applied patch 3, the game would no longer start. It would kick me back to my desktop every time.I've spent about an hour poking around forums, but you know what? Shove this game. They should be PAYING me to do this much work. Thank God I only paid $5 for it at the 5 Below store.Thanks ""Atari"" for turning a title with a fine lineage into 1 more pound of weight that my garbage men will need to cart off come Monday morning."
2,OMG!!!,"I have her album, and this ish is hot!!!!omg, Ciara is tha bomb..i really think that she is going to make BIG money outta this album, make sure yall cop dat..."
2,This one started it all!,"This was Lee Roy's first album on Arista... before all the hits: What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am, Holding My Own, On The Road, Heart's Desire, etc., etc. It's got some great stuff on it... the horns, the diversity, Lee Roy's soulful from-the-gut delivery. It's a great album, and even after 16 years of fan-dom, still spends regular time in my car's CD player. ... even though ""Red Hot"" nearly cost me some hefty speeding fines! Check it out."
2,No Problem Here!,"I installed Virtual Drive 7 about two weeks ago. Since then I've created ""virtual disks"" for the following games: Will Rock, Microsoft Train Simulator, Diablo II, Adventure Pinball, Unreal Tournament 2003, and Call of Duty. Everything works fine. I don't need to switch CDs anymore, and I can even see a performance boost in some of these games. I have no idea why people might be having trouble with this software because it works fine for me. I'd give it a 5 star rating, but I decided to take a star away just in case other people might have trouble with it. I recommend Virtual Drive 7 to anybody who hates hunting down CDs. Just make sure to check the return policy."
1,Ended up Returning this Item,The antenna device that you have to plug to your hard drive HAS to be facing UP or it will not work. There's only one way to plug it in and it was facing DOWN for us. Never could get it to work - had to return it. The toy company gave me a voucher for the value of it but now I can only buy either a Mattel or Fisher Price Item to replace it and it can't be done online. I feel like I got the shaft!!
1,Great Idea,"I loved the mouse but could not get the keyboard to function properly. I exchanged the first unit for a new one and both worked great, for 10 days. No response from Gyration via e-mail so I called the Tech line (a toll call as they do not offer an 800 or 888 number). After waitng for more than 30 minutes I was told they would ship a new receiver to me in three to five business days. It's been 23 and I'm still waiting."
1,Good sleeping pill.Not real SCI-FI,I am a big Haldeman fan but this must have been written in a period of writers block.Most of the story is in first person monologe with little verbal interaction between the characters.It just skims along never putting any depth in the story or the people in it.Even when she cought her husband using there 14 year old son for his pleasure did any conversation take place.In any real life situation like that there would have been plenty of words and hellfire taking place.Probably a little mayhem also.That would have created some excitement to the story.But in the book the whole episode was passed over in a few sentances with nothing happening.If this book had been written by an unknown author it probably would have been nothing but a rejection slip.I just don't see how all these readers gave it 4 stars.It is misleeding to people who use reviews to pick books.I got it from a library.If I had bought it based on the reviews i would be really mad.
1,It made no sense...,"...I watched it at school, and everyone in my class was either sleeping or scratching their heads in confusion. I just don't understand why Spielberg made this movie...along the way, people started talking in random languages (pardon me for being vague, I don't remember WHICH languages) and, well...it was just weird. Why did they? I have no idea. The ending just baffled me...*spoiler* why did he walk onto the spaceship? HUH? Maybe I was just having a bad day, but it really made no sense to me. I was alternating between bored and frustrated at not understanding the 'plotline'.Quite a poor effort, conclusively...this movie was weak."
2,BAD AZZ,THE MOVIE WAS EXCELLENT TAN TAO LIANG WAS GREAT SO WAS MENG FEI I THINK THIS WAS LIKE THERE 3RD OR 4TH MOVIE TOGETHER AND BLACK KO'S GOOD TOO
1,Not good help for resumes,"The book suggests using indents and tabs to make a resume. Using tabs would make things bump around strangely if you edit or change font. No mention of using a table and turning off the lines to make placing text and editing easy. Resume they do make is not a great-looking document, and has (for my field) awkward formatting (like the year buried at the end of the line). No mention of Word's online resume templates. I'd hoped to have this book as a reference for students, but the suggestions in here are things I'd tell them NOT to do. Skip this book. Get a good book on using Word, and Robin Williams excellent book on graphic design tips, ""The Non-Designer's Design Book""."
1,Worst movie in years,"I haven't seen such a negative, sub-standard movie in years. The preview looked great but I don't think I laughed once while watching the real thing."
1,LOUSY PHONE,"Good Price with a nice package, but very poor quality sound. We purchased 2 of these phones...both had echo, and low sound quality. We could not even have a conversation with the other party. Both are being returned!!"
1,"Paralyzed on slate floor, the retarded cousin of Roomba","Pros: concept of a hard floor wet vacuum cleanerCons:- gets stuck all the time on uneven slate floor, lacks clearance below- gets stuck all the time under kitchen counter, shelves etc, lacks power to pull itself out- foam wheels deform after sitting on floor for a while, way too soft and lacks grip- cannot recognize water, complains empty tank- fixed cleaning time, lacks intelligent timer/algorithm to cover the whole room then stop- does not cover entire 200 ft room, leaving dry spots here and there- uses uncommon 4/3A battery cells, hard to find and expensive to replace individual cells- battery pack is sealed and unserviceable for non-technical people"
2,Uplifting even in the hardest of circumstances!,"I work with troubled teens, and one of the girls brought this book to girls group. All the girls started taking turns reading it, and making the positive self-affirmations out loud. It was a moving and profound experience. I can say that every girl in the room felt her heart fill up as she read and spoke the words Vanzant helps us find within ourselves. All girls were able to find a reason to respect themselves, some even, a reason to live."
2,I Love You Peter Rabbit,"I just love my new Peter Rabbit Collection. The books came in a beautiful, colorful Peter Rabbit theme box displaying many of the other characters. The small latch opens easily with my little fingers and the small size books fit in my hands perfectly. I enjoy looking at all the pretty pictures and hearing the stories about Benjamin Bunny, Squirrel Nutkin & Mrs. Tittlemouse. Thank you Beatrix Potter for loving children and writing these beautiful books. Mzgrandma's girl"
2,"Great Vacuum, Short Cord...","This is a great vacuum, very powerful and stores away nice... The cord on it is way too short and won't even make it across a large room without having to unplug and move to another outlet. They thought of everything, I am not sure why they did not think to put a longer cord on this model."
1,Oven was not functional,It blew the circuit breaker every time I tried to use it. I contacted your customer service function and was told no others were available so they would issue credit & a call tag for it to be returned.
1,Photos are compelling however&#65533;,"I found the fotos were interesting however I live blocks from ground zero and I am a professional (& Famous) photographer. Many of my friends are fireman , police, FEMA and rescue workers... In my opinion the book is pushing the authors religious beliefs - I have a problem with this --- I am not cetain that the money is going to profit the victims- I have seen what they have taken fotos of & they should give the money to the victoms - not for their personal religious causes!"
2,"Review of ""The Artists Specials"" DVDs","I just recently received the Artists' Specials DVD Collectors Set. I teach art in a home school co-op and I was looking for some biographies which were appropriate for high school students. I've just recently watched two of the videos and they are quite good. In fact, after the one on Rembrandt, I did some research on his life and the information portrayed in the video was totally accurate. My hats off to this company. I would recommend these for any classroom or home school setting."
1,There are better books out there.,"I have to say that I am not very impressed with Ms. Singer's first foray into bookwriting. I looked the book over because I like her Web site, Knitty, but this book disappointed me.First of all, the instruction sections are not as clear as they could be. The pictures should be bigger and there should be more written instruction. Besides, as the editorial review above states, it sounds like she's trying to imitate SnB. That's never a good way to go about writing a book, even though it is the sincerest form of flattery.Secondly, the patterns were very, very disappointing. Most of the patterns not available for free on her Web site are extremely basic. I am glad I only looked this book over in the store--had I bought it without looking at it, the patterns would have been a huge disappointment since half of them are available for free and the other half aren't very good. :/"
1,NFL Blitz 2000,"This software is excellent for the PC platform. It is very good for the N64 platform. For the Color Gameboy platform, one should not even bother purchasing it. I thought I'd get somewhat similar graphics to Tarzan; this game has graphics similar to mid-80s games - it is a major disappointment. If I could return it, I'd do so in a second. This game has to be one of the worst-conceived games for the gameboy platform. If you want to buy NFL Blitz 2000 - buy it for the PC, don't bother to buy it for the gameboy"
2,Good product,"Tune Belt Original CD Player Carrier CD1 is good purchase.I bought it for my son. We use it ,when need to ride far ."
1,Great Idea But It Never Worked,"My husband and I bought this toy for our 8 year old daughter for Christmas and we can't get the thing to work. We've replaced batteries, messed with the film etc but to no avail. When you pull the lever to take a picture nothing happens. What a disapointment."
1,Advertised as Like New - Wasn't. Took 4 Weeks to Get,"It took 4 weeks to receive the book from the time I ordered it- almost too late to get it before my trip departure date. The shipping label appeared to defective and maybe that was the problem in the delivery time. Also, the book was missing the tear out map and many pages contained someone's underlining. That isn't a big deal but it wasn't described that way."
1,If only John Silence lived up to his name...,"The John Silence stories are not among Blackwood's more inspired creations. Even the best of them tend to conclude with a pompous ""explanation"" of the supernatural events, as Blackwood attempts to propagandise for his personal brand of mysticism. This is all very well, but if you don't happen to share Blackwood's beliefs it's no more than an irritation, and even if you do it might well bring you down to earth with a bump after some of his fine atmospheric writing in the better tales. It's a pity that S T Joshi, who made much the same observations in his excellent ""The Weird Tale"", couldn't have persuaded Dover to bring out, instead, Blackwood's truly astounding collection, ""Incredible Adventures"", from which Silence's tiresome explicitness is almost entirely absent."
1,Not worth the time....,"Having read the synopsis and the reviews I thought that I would give this book a try but I was very disappointed in the story and the writing quality.It is a story told very simply. Half way through I found myself starting to skip pages.....not a good sign at all. There was no substance to the story and parts of it were implausible. Poor Irish lass, who after the death of her husband decided to immigrate to America. There really wasn't a lot to the story nor was there sufficient depth in the characters.. I am still unsure what genre this story should fall under, paranormal or historical......certainly it could not be classed as romance.Overall it certainly didn't live up to the premise."
1,"5"" wiggly giggly ball","""Extra Durable for Pets"" They must have used a doq with no teeth for T&E. Lasted 2 days with my Boxer. Waste of $8.95+ shipping"
2,Force (movie with John Abraham & Genelia D'Sousa),"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's action packed from the opening right through to the nail-biting climax. John Abraham was excellent, as was Genelia. Their on-screen chemistry was surprising given their respective sizes, but it worked."
2,I Enjoyed This,"Someone gave me this book after I told them how much I loved 'The Hunger Games.' It was an interesting read. It had hints of 'Brave New World,' and this not so perfect, 'perfect' community. It was definitely better than 'The Uglies,' which is also a YA sort of dark, future society. Out of this genre I would have to say that 'Hunger Games' and 'Logans Run' are my favorite, but 'The Giver' gave an interesting take on it, even if it was a little depressing. I would say this is probably a better message for kids to read than THG, though, not quite as much fun."
1,Help Us Peter Jackson!!!,"Every year around this time I get sentimental about the Lord of the Rings movies. Even though it's been 6 years since the Return of the King was released in theatres, I still feel anticipation and excitement, as if by some wondrous power a new installment of this eternal saga will be released this third week of December (as in times of yore).Alas, that chapter has ended, and the only joy I have left is for the inevitable release of this series in the extended (Platinum) Blu-ray edition. But where is it? It's been 5 years since the standard Platinum edition has been released! Blu-ray isn't a new technology. As many people have commented, we already have the standard editions - why buy them in Blu-ray? We want, dare I say ""need"", the Platinum (extended) Blu-ray!!! If NewLine is unwilling to forego their greed to support their fans, I have no choice but to appeal to Peter Jackson to take up our cause. Help us Peter Jackson!!!"
1,Not for the math buff,"""The Fractal Experience"" is probably right on the money, for those looking for ""cool""! What you get are very good fractal images, morphing from one to another; along with music background. Very good, for those at that level. My interest go more to the math, history, and the fellow who pioneered the field (Benoit Mandelbrot); along with demo images. If that's what you want, look elsewhere!"
2,Andrew Prior Cape Town,"It took me some time to realise that Banville had set this early book against the backdrop of the Irish potato famine but by then it didn't seen all that important intent as he is in providing analyses and descriptions of his retinue of personalities who march in and out of the book like characters on a stage. Yes, he did it well enough in this intriguing book to have set him apart as a promising novelist who did not disappoint in his later works. It still puzzles me why he also had to personalise inanimate nature and objects to the extent that he did I'm not sure what it means to say that an armchair has a look of surprise; or a room a suspicious glance; or a farmyard a feeling of tranquility. But I suppose that it what metaphors are supposed to do....however once or twice in a book they may work but more often than that they sink taloned fingers into your throat."
1,wrong product,"I bought this product as an adaptor to connect to my wireless modem. It does not work because my modem is not blue tooth compatible (its an AT&T modem). Needless to say, I am VERY disappointed after spending $32 on this product and not getting the result i was hoping for. Maybe its ""operator error"", but personally, I don't think so!"
2,"Works great for Heart Rate monitors (garmin, polar, etc)","I use this product for my garmin heart rate monitor while training (running, cycling, etc.). It really helps improve the signal transmission from the chest to the heart rate strap. The great thing about this gel is it is odorless and isn't greasy. You can easily wipe it off with a paper towel or cloth and it won't stain. It's very affordable as well so it can be used on a daily basis without breaking the bank. It can be a bit cold when applying during the winter, but once your natural body heat warms it up that feeling goes away."
2,Just what I needed,"This book really summarized my child up in a nut shell. It was very easy to read and understand. I recommend for any parent that thinks they are the only one out there with a ""spirited child""."
2,A good book about the mental aspects of trading.,"This is the best book written about the psychological and mental aspects of trading. This book hasn't got much about technical analysis, entry or exit points, but tells you how to handle trading mentally."
2,superflu? - bien sur que non!,"very popular singer in France. recommended for those wishing to hear contemporary French music... surtout - ecoutez ""ou et avec qui tu m'aimes"" et ""Lucie""...."
1,Be Ready for a Challenge,"First shipment I received was damaged, however, it was returned with no problem. Second shipment was damaged, again. I attempted to fix it myself because I like the cabinet. It looks good, it's just not made well. There are no instructions for mounting and the hardware it comes with is absolutely worthless. It was extremely frustrating getting it all to work out. After a trip to the hardware store and some creative thinking, it's hanging and functional...again, it LOOKS good...i just hope it stays that way."
1,Worst racing game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,By far the worst racing game ever terrible graphics terrible damage effects and even with the cheats it seems lame and east will not recommend this to anyone BEWARE!!!!!!!!! don't buy this game
1,Do not buy this booster seat!!,I'm a mother of triplets. I purchased two of these booster seats when our babies were 10 months old to save some space in our house. I absolutely hate them!! As other posters indicated you can't clean the chairs because there are so many holes for the food to fall down. It's NASTY!!! DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIR!!!
2,"Great for Budget, good for cheap thrills","Todd Sheets creates a gore filled feature that will prove an entertaining watch. The pace is fast, there is little wait for the blood to spill. The shot on video quality shows limitations but Todd Sheets is imaginative in his blocking and scene framing and avoids the ""stand and shoot"" syndrome that brings doldrums.The acting is what would be expected from a low budget project but I don't think any of us expect ""MacBeth"".On the negative, some of the flesh eating scenes are drawn out and perhaps could have been shortened. The music is good, consistent and appropriately helps the pace of the vid. Grab the video, a few buddies and some beer and prepare for a few good yuks..."
1,Two Fatal Flaws,"Reading the great quotations, the thesaurus, or anything else that features vivid expression is valuable advice. It almost makes up for the book's two fatal flaws. First, ""Elements"" is jokey, sophomoric, and superficial in too many places. Second, the book's main prescriptions are neither summarized for ready reference nor linked to any underlying principles of good composition. Strunk & White's ""Elements of Style"" is more systematic and a better choice for my money."
2,"GREAT CD , ROCK ,BLUES ,PRAISED BY JOHN LENNON !","A SUPERB FOLLOW-UP TO THE FIRST SOLO ALBUM ,TITLE McCARTNEY , PAUL DOES A FINE BLUES NUMBER TITLED ON THE WAY , COMING UP WAS PRAISED BY FORMER BEATLE JOHN LENNON(WHICH WAS A VERY RARE OCCURENCE!) ,DARKROOM PSUEDO-PSYCHADELIA ROCKER , 1 OF 2 SONGS REFERRING TO PAUL'S IMPRISONMENT IN JAPAN FOR MARIJUANA POSSESION (THE OTHER BEING FROZEN JAP) ONE OF THOSE RARE ALBUMS YOU CAN LISTEN TO ALL THE WAY THROUGH WITHOUT , HAVING TO SKIP ANYTHING!"
1,Good but not durable,This mouse worked well for me relieving pain in my arm and elbow. However the device did not last 3 months with light use.
2,Probably the greatest set of all my stuff..,"This, in my opinion, is not only the best work done by Sasha and Digweed, but also the best set of electronic music around. The atmosphere changes throughout this CD and the music is breathtaking.It opens up with a mellow-paced track and picks up as you go along, adding in vocals (which, contrary to another reviewer, I think are great) here and there. The sounds and track selection is perfect for this set, and the mixing is even better. I wouldn't even call it mixing, its more of a transition. You don't notice the mixing because of how smoothly Sasha and Digweed put this set together.This CD deserves more than 5 stars, and if your a fan of electronic music, buy it. It will probably be one of the best (if not, the best) sets you will ever hear."
2,Dukes,The sweatshirt was exactly what we expected. It was a christmas gift and the receiver of the sweatshirt loved it. Nice sweatshirt for the price.
1,Terrible 3rd part to a great story.,"This movie was awful. I loved the first two movies, even though number two had it's faults, it was ultimately enjoyable. This movie, on the other hand was just bad. Stupid plot devices, plot holes galore, bad dialogue, WAYYYY too much cgi, and a sucky ending for all the characters. I saw it once in the theaters and haven't had the stomach to endure it again, even though It's been on cable several times."
2,Interesting,"If you're checking out this product because you think it might be interesting, then go ahead and get it. Worth the read, especially if it's a subject that you are looking to learn more about."
2,Most parts were good,"Most of the parts of this book were good. The parts about the foreign guy and his wife were a little hard to get through, but the parts with Jack and Laurie were, as always, enjoyable to read."
2,Please the parents and the kids,"Our almost 3-year old son knows nearly every word of this album by heart, our 15-month old perks up when ralph is on, and we parents hum the tunes and enjoy the smart lyrics - even though we hear this music daily ! The music is rich and doesn't go stale, and manages to bridge the generation gap."
2,I'm plugging this plug,Replaced the old style plugs in my Chevy P30 based motor home with these. Runs smooth as new and I like the fact that there is no gapping required on these plugs. Worry free installation.
2,"Great macro/closeup techniques, but a little outdated","John Shaw explains many good techniques for closeup nature photography, which are applicable even in today's digital world. However, this is still a book from the film-era, so anything relatively recent or digital (e.g. magnification ratios for digital cropped sensors, advancements in AF technology, change in lens lineup, etc) is not covered. It is perhaps due for a quick revision to bring it up to date to today's cameras. Also, the photos in this book are good, but perhaps not as striking as the photos in his other book, Nature Photography Field Guide."
1,"Coulter At It Again--Same Ol, Same Ol","This is a collection of Coulter's columns from ""Human Events"" and her syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate. This series of essays provides you with a lot more breadth but not as much depth as the typical book topic.Ann Coulter is at her best or worst, depending upon your perspective, once again leveling liberals with a rather cranked vocabulary, to say the least. Her writing (and I assume speaking) style leaves me cold--I think rants weaken arguments not strengthen them--but her points of view are worth considering and from time to time she gets off a one-liner that is downright funny.Would I recommend this book--as opposed to others worthy of your time and money? Nah. Would I go across the street to hear Coulter speak? Nah."
2,A classic for every home library,"My two favorites in this collection are The Thin Man and The Maltese Falcon. I love these hard-boiled detective novels doubly for their sheer entertainment and their place in history. If you want a fascinating read to go allong with this collection, get The Perfect Murder: A Study In Detection by David Lehman. It will clue you into these novels and life. These classic American Novels by Hammett are about to explode in historical research as these novels create an important link in America from WWII to our morality."
1,all the funny parts were in the previews :(,"I am a huge fan of ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"". this movie was about 45 minutes too long and both of those shows are much more funny. parts had us laughing out loud, but it was a stretch to make it a full-length movie that was entertaining for only half."
1,Overrated Camera,Tried to do what others have done on this camera and I purchased it because I am on a Mac operating system. This camera failed to work well on my system. It states this on the website I visited to complete the set up process (since it doesn't have any instructions that worked). You will need to call a technician to complete the camera to function.
2,A Film For Open-Minded People,"The editorial review is way off-base. It's true that the film is very long, but it is not tiresome in the least. It's very interesting and will appeal to anyone with an open mind about biological life forms being more than just their physical bodies."
1,Cool But Useless,"These keyboards are cute, portable, and spill-proof, but indestructable they're not. I've owned several and, after sending two of them back for replacement, wound up throwing them all out. After a couple of months (at best) several of the keys stop working, rendering them useless. This has happened too many times to be a fluke. An indestructable keyboard that fails under normal use? Don't bother."
2,Best movie ever,"Joss Whedon is one of the best (and under appriciated) minds in Hollywood. Not only is this movie intelligent, it will make you laugh and cry and think and it will blow your mind. I would've never thought you can make an exellent film about space cowboys but here it is and it is wonderful. Like a leaf in the wind..."
2,Great speakers,"Okay I have read alot of reviews on different speakers before buying, and I am glad I listened to the reviews on these speakers, because they are great, easy to install and put up on my poles. I hooked them to a Sony 750 receiver and they work great with it. and WOW.. they are a really good size. Great clear, crisp sound. Perfect for outside because the wind, splashing at the pool, and rain does not distort the sound at all. Now if you are looking for alot of base then get a woofer to go with these. But I didnt want alot of base because I wanted to hear the music because your outside and lots of different noises can interfere when you listen to music outside. I did not get these for inside. So I will tell you these are perfect. I am very happy."
1,Lackluster resource,The lessons in this book are unoriginal and unexciting. I don't see myself using any of them without drastically developing them. I wish I had bought a different book!
2,Great Book,"Great resource!I'm doing some research for a fiction book I want to write and this is the first book I picked up on the occult. For a beginner that wants a basic overview on the mystical and magical religions and spiritual practices throughout the ages, I highly recommend this book.Besides being a great reference book, it's written so well you'll probably want to read each and every entry."
1,Didn't carbonate,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and we were really excited about this. We have friends into beer making and he had always wanted to brew beer so we were hoping this would get us familiar with the process. We followed the simple instructions and when the time had come we tried the beer and it was horrible. No carbonation, it was just flat, nasty beer. So disappointed. :("
2,Intriguing ancient history,"From the first page to the last, this is a fast moving tale that gives its characters depth. I highly recommend The Physician (Cole) to both history buffs and aspiring medical students, and to grandmothers like myself interested in reading worthwhile literature."
2,Not Bad But it won't play Iron Maiden,"The concept is great and is all right for listening to talk. But needs improvement in the bass. I tried a cut from an iron maiden album and the distorton was terrible. Garmin might do well to get with Bose and figure out how to make a good small speaker. Also there should be a way to delete the cuts without using an additional computer. If there is, I did not find it.Also, the information on it is out of date. I still wish there was a way to download monthly updates to the data in regards to food, shopping, enertainment, etc. I think that could be a good service and additional source for revenue for Garmin"
1,Would not buy,These things are too small and extremely flemsy. They wont hold their shape. I'll be getting some different masks and trashing these.
2,A fun way to learn numbers.,My 18 month old daughter loves this DVD. The number characters are fun and she learned 1 to 10 very quickly. I wasn't surprised that she did after having such great success with the Meet the Letters video. I really love this series and I feel so much better about having her watch this educational video instead of Barney.
1,ultrak 360 stopwatch,I used this 3 times and already broke. Does not reset. I wouldn't buy this product anymore.Ultrak 360 Stopwatch
2,"Excellent gift to colleagues, customers, etc.","This title by Lee Morgan makes an excellent gift to clients, bosses, colleagues, and even family! They will feel uncomfortable about the title of the album, but will not be able to complain, given the quality of the music."
2,Love this cookbook!,I borrowed this cookbook from a friend of mine and loved it! Great flavor and relatively simple recipes so I ordered a copy of my own. I plan on buying her Italian book also.
2,Comfortable and cheap,These earplugs fit well and sounded pretty good. Bass response wasn't that great but what do you want for the price?
2,Does what it's supposed to do,Got the BJC8200 a few weeks ago and have been printing like a madman...the photo magenta was the first to go low. Got the nectron since Amazon doesn't seem to carry the Canon ink for this printer. Haven't noticed a difference...we'll see how long it lasts...
1,Not Impressed,"The gore was slightly impressive, however the story was not. The worst was the line from the guy who finds Poe on the park bench. ""Is there someone I can call for you?"" The telephone wasn't available to the public until 1891, several decades after Poe died. My suspension of disbelief failed me. Also, Cusack's acting as himself, as he always does, wasn't all that interesting either. I've seen much better out of the 70's horror movie dollar bin than this thing."
1,wrong cover sent,Placed the order for a 2007 Prius using the online vehicle selector and was sent a cover for a much smaller car so the cover did not fit and had to be returned. The material is a highly reflective silver that is very bright like a Mylar space blanket. In the past the type of material has made the greatest difference in longevity with the expensive ones lasting up to 10 years on my cars and cheaper ones lasting 2-3 years regardless of the color of the car cover.
1,For the Archives,"There is some history that is still relevant today and there is other that should be recognized as influential in its time, then filed away. I own this on vinyl and have framed both the cover and the record as decoration. I never saw a need to replace it on CD, for the simple reason that songs like ""When I'm 64"" and ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" are badly dated, not really standing the test of time. On the other hand, another 1967 release, ""Are You Experienced"" by Jimi Hendrix, is still challenging musicians today. This cover is also on the wall, but the CD is in the player. Big difference. 2-stars at best for Pepper."
2,Worth every penny...,"This is a great litter box I have in the corner of my computer room. It is rather large but what do u expect for a litterbox that has built in stairs? The stairs have cut down on the amount of litter tracking signifigantly and I don't smell the litterbox all the time like I used to. A very great buy for our home & kitty, indeed!"
1,So-so sequel,"This movie wasn't much without Vin Diesel. Tyrese was funny, but Paul Walker should have had Vin to back him up in his acting. The cars were great, but Eva Mendes can't make up for the abscence of Vin and Michelle Rodriguez. Better luck with the next movie, guys. Make it more worth our time to watch."
1,I should qualify the 1-star,"The demo version of the game is very good but be forewarned when buying the retail version: I and many other customers have had problems installing and/or playing this game! The Emperor website has a forum where users can share their experiences and many, including myself, have vented about our inability to run the game based on the minimum system requirements. Be warned: if you have the minimum system requirements for Emperor, that may still not be enough. I have more than adequate resources to run the game, but the intro movie is the only thing that will play, then my monitor goes blank and its lights all begin blinking. There do not appear to be any patches in development to address user concerns at this time. I am not the only user who has experienced this frustrating problem. I'm returning my copy of the game and will try something else."
1,zone free NOT,"I bought this mechine to watch DVD's from other zones than #1. as it appeared to be presented in their advertisement. It will not. When I tried calling the company from the # in the manuel, I was directed to 10 15 15 8000 a 'new' directory assistance' company charging $5.49 for information. There now is no listing for 'CyberHome' in Fremont, CA. The player is OK but it won't play other zone DVDs. Don't believe the add."
1,Never received my order,I never received my item that I ordered and when I called Amazon they were not helpful so I had to let my bank dispute this for me and received a credit on my account.
2,"Great DV Camcorder, Great price!","First of all I want to plainly say that this a great DV-Cam for a low $499!!! Don't tell me that's not a low price for such quality. I have one and use it to make skate-videos. I do a lot of skateboarding (3-4hrs/day) and this thing has it all! It is light weight, small, high quality, durable, and full of all the effects and features you could ever need. Don't pass thing up, trust me!"
1,snore,"But for the cacophonous soundtrack, it would have been a nice nap on a rainy day. Mr. Dylan should really offer refunds for those who were kept awake. Any attempt to discern a story line, or heaven forbid a plot, was constantly thwarted by inconsequential retrospective music bites. Much more than merely a major disappointment, did I ever owe my lover big time for getting him to go with me !!"
2,Just what I needed to protect my brand new car!,Simple installation. Worked well. Just what I needed after replacing our over 10year old car with a brand spanking new one. I wanted to avoid all the scratches on the door and garage wall. Works like a charm!
1,DO NOT TRUST,"My accessory pack did not come with a screen cloth, a screen protector,no remote for earphones and added to the earphones the wires were frayed there was also no 32mb memory card"
2,Great acting!!!,This show was so fantastic that I watched 2 whole seasons in less than 2 weeks on demand. I can't wait for season 3!!
2,Its a battery,"What can I say besides its a good battery and does what a battery does. As far as battery life it seems to last forever in my thermometer. Also, Amazon shipping was fast and reasonable."
1,CX4600 epson,This product is a rip off. Not only the Black cartridge but also there CX4600 epsoncolor cartridge is no good.I printed off about 10 copys and the copys werebad. I also ran out of ink after print approximately 20 sheets.I will never by this product again.
1,Deep Wizardry,This book was so boring... It could have been a lot more effective if it was shorter and more to-the-point.
2,Wonderful Learning Game,"I have played this game with Kindergarten, first, and second grade students. They all loved it! It is not only a great learning game for decoding, but it also helps them learn about vocabulary they might not have known before. The younger students need someone who is older to be the person who flips the main deck, and then judges whether or not they have made a real word. Second graders could certainly use dictionary skills to look up a word in question. Ties are hard to judge, but I usually went with the payer with less pairs. I love this card game, and the students I have played it with just beg to play it again and again."
1,Not satisfied.,"Everything came in the box as promised...however, I was not able to make it work worth the investment.We had a sporadic 1bar reading before the use of the boost. Afterwards we had a sporadic 5bar...but it would go down to no bars and still drop calls. So we returned it...I am sure it could work for some situations, but for ours it didnt work.The return was easy and I received the full refund...so no hassle and no loss other than $7 for return shipping."
1,"If these are the best, I can't imagine the runners-up!","This was one of the worst books I have read in my life. I suffered through the book hoping that the stories would get better as the years progressed. The majority of the stories had no real plot. The tales just end as abruptly and as strangely as they began. The stories from the early '80's are so bizarre...you have to be on the same drugs that the author was on when he/she wrote it to enjoy or understand the story. I guess these stories are emblematic of the decade. I was disappointed since these stories were supposedly culled from all the other ones of the decade to comprise ""the best of"". Surely the editor could have done better!"
1,Depressing from a woman's viewpoint,"Oprah supposedly said that if you read this book, you'll never trust men again. She's right! But I found this book compelling reading; I finished it in one day. However I was disappointed in the viewpoint that women are always victimized by men and by the stereotyping of airline pilots. The book just left a bad taste in my mouth."
2,"Davis must've ""channeled"" the late, great Garland","It is without a doubt that one of the best performances by an actress portraying another actress belongs to the magnificent Judy Davis. Awards have been deservedly given to her for her wrenching and sympathetic glimpse at one of the great entertainers of the 20th century.Regardless of others' comments about the ""soap opera trimmings"" or Lorna Luft's ""recollections,"" the powerhouse acting of Davis makes up for any discrepancies.Take me ""over that rainbow"" with you, Miss Davis!"
2,FABULOUS!,"Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda are even more Fabulous this year than the first season. There are four more episodes this season and more spectacular fashions. Every episode seems to be smarter and sexier than the last."
1,A complete travesty,"DO NOT buy this if you are a fan of the original US version released in 1990. The cutting of lines/scenes really retracts from the movie and overall rushes the movie past key character development and plot emphasis. The original was funny, thoughtful and you really got the sense of the camaraderie between the characters and an understanding of why what they were doing was so important/dangerous/exciting.A damn shame really. Maybe in a couple of years they will release the 2-disk collection containing both the DVD version of the original and of this hacked-up tragedy as they did in the UK."
2,The only readable book on telecommunication signaling,"Van Bosse is to be commended for creating the first and to date only readable text on telecommunication signaling. If you're looking for an explanation of how various signaling protocols are used in the PSTN, this book provides all the essential information you need."
1,leads to mushy-headedness,"All that needs to be said is that the BASIS of this book is the thought that ALL religions are right because they ALL have been BELIEVED IN by people. Therefore, logically, NO religion is true if it claims to be the Real Truth.Beware: this virus hidden at the core of the book may infect your kids for a long time to come. Good feelings and wishful thoughts may eternally defraud if not tied to revealed truth.There is nothing wrong with fantasy, but when it is a fantasy that seeks to supplant established religious beliefs, it should hold up a sign that says, ""This is a new religion we are seeking to establish here!"""
1,Two units failed. Tech support worthless.,"When I configured the first unit, it froze when disabled WEP on 802.11a. After waiting almost an hour for support, I was told to reset it (I already had), and then return it since the ""diag"" light still lit.When I disabled WEP on the replacement unit, it froze just the the previous one had. My email to support described the status of the indicators, and that I had already tried to reset it. Supports reply was for a different product, asked me to try to reset it, and asked for the status of the indicators. Not at all helpfull.Since I knew the exact steps I went through that caused the second unit to freeze, I asked that support try the steps I went through to determine if they had a firmware problem. They asked me to take my laptop back to the store I bought the AP from, and see if I can't get my laptop to work there. No mention of my broken access point.I highly recommend that you do not purchase this unit."
2,"Great idea, needs improvement.","I love the size of these shakers. However, the pepper shaker's top didn't tighten well. After a certain point of tension, the lid lost its grip on the shaker and spins loosely. I sent it back to receive a new set. The second set was better, but still needed an o-ring or rubber washer or something to create the grip between the lids and the shaker. I kept the second pair. But I'll need to modify one shaker to tighten the top securely. I'm going to try a rubber ring of some sort."
1,"Excellent fictional humor, poor biography...","How did this book make it out of the trash can and onto the printing presses? The book is filled with glaring factual errors that are simply unexplainable. (eg. Ani did not marry her former drummer; Lucille Clifton is a famous poet, not a worker at an abortion clinic). One thing is for sure, Mr. Quirino is badly in need of an editor.The only redeeming part of the book are the song interpretations, and that is simply because so many of them are so ridiculous that you will laugh out loud."
2,Sounds great!!!,"Everything is working perfectly and it's hooked up to my 50 in. plasma. This is perfect for the starter and also has optical and digital inputs. Actually, it's better than starter and for the price...this is it. Trust me, unless you want to go crazy and pay ridiculous prices for others that do the same thing. Get good speakers and it'll work great."
2,Another classic to add to the list.,"Dara has always been one of my favorite DnB DJ's of all time. Once again, he hits us with an onslaught of great American Drum and Bass tunes. Right off the bat, he starts off with a deep roller from a guy named ICR. ICR also appears on track number 5. Both of these tunes are the highlights of the mix, but you can be sure that the rest is pounding bass and tight breaks. Dara moves through a Drum and Bass spectrum with songs from DJ Abstract, G13, and Dune, just to name a few. This CD has been in my car stereo for about 72 hours and I can't wait to hear it again. Dara.....Keep em' comin'."
1,Not For A Casual Stroll,"For what it is, Atlanta Walks is a decent book with good maps and useful information on area sites. However, before you buy it know that most of these walks are around 5 miles long! To me, this is mostly for avid, athletic walkers and cyclists, not casual sightseers. I checked this out at the bookstore before purchasing it and was glad I did. I hoped to find more urban walks (no Cabbagetown, no Grant Park) and hoped they would be in the 1- to 2-mile range, highlighting more shopping and sightseeing opportunities. This is less for someone who wants to explore Atlanta, and more for someone who wants to exercise in an urban environment."
1,Too many contradictions,I am not trying to belittle any of the followers of the author but I just have a hard time believing in this notion when it's constantly contradicted. For instance the author makes a bold statement that she has gone years without food and then in the next few chapters indicates she has tea and crackers. I don't know about anyone else but the statement without food means just that WITHOUT FOOD. Not some food sometime. Nothing wrong with the ideas but it's not grounded enough in reality. What would have been better is more a fundamental approach to how it's actually done.
2,Would you rather...,"This is a book of choices - choices that are not always so wonderful. Even so, the choosing is fun. Young children can learn about selecting the ""lesser of two (or three or four) evils."" When used with a group of readers, the idea of consensus can be examined."
2,Kurt Russell fan,I watched these when I was growing up and found them very entertaining. Now a days we need wholesome entertainment like this just to escape the everyday grind.
2,woohoo you go Johnny!,"For a hardcore Depp fan The Libertine is a great movie that has Depp playing a seductive, arrogant, and dark figure who seduces his audience and leaves them wanting more. Loved this story and continue to love Johnny Depp! He never ceases to amaze at the depth of character he is able to reach in each movie he agrees to be a part of... Bravo bravo!"
2,Just what we were looking for!,"My doctor recommended this book after my son had been diagnosed by another pediatrician with colic. This book helped my son learn to eliminate feeding during the night gradually and with little crying. Listening to the baby cry was very hard for my husband and I, but it has never taken more than 5-10 minutes for my son to fall asleep. Now at 5 months he sleeps through the night with no crying when he is put in his crib. I would highly recommend this book to parents before they give birth, thus eliminating the mistakes we make as parents to cause sleep problems in our children."
2,I refused to give it back to the library,"I was a lifetime Mormon till I went through a divorce and decided to take a critical look at my own beliefs. Having been born in the Church, serving a full time Mission and marrying in the temple I thought I knew all about Joseph Smith and the history of Mormonism. This book changed my life more than the Book of Mormon ever could have. For the first time many missing parts of the Mormon puzzle began to fit together and my life, as I understood it came crashing down. I literally threw up as I discovered what a bastard Joseph Smith was. No, this book isn't perfect, but having been written in 1945, it has proven itself to be the definitive expose of Mormonism's founder. I bear witness it has more truth in it than you will find inside the whitewashed history of the Mormon Church. I found myself unable to return my copy to the library and chose to pay the replacement cost. It is one of my most cherished possessions."
2,Almost unbelievable -- rivetting!,"I would say that this book pushes the ability for the reader to suspend their disbelief... except that it is all true! This is the kind of book that you don't want to put down. The main character (the author) manages to pull off an incredible series of frauds, at an incredibly young age. After reading this book, I felt the urge to learn as much as I could about this man, and started doing research on the web for more information.A fascinating story about an incredible person..."
2,Dog Loves em!,"I picked up a couple of these frisbees in the Fall 2012. My Australian Shepard loves chasing and catching them. He did bite a hole in them right away, but he gets a bit carried away when playing. I think this toy is a great way to give your dog exercise."
1,Ink Money Pit,Don't buy. I have turneed mine on twice since we bought it two years ago. You can't even use the scanner feature if the ink cartridges are out of ink. Makes no sense. Epson should be ashame of themselves. I splurged and bought new cartridges and now the black ink is clogged from sitting. After numerous cleanings now my cyan is out of ink. Piece of junk!
2,"Hard-hitting advice, easily retained","I listened to this tape in about 1978 and have just read the hard copy that came with it. The written version strikes me as powerfully now as the tape did then. I would write more, but the time-saving advice found on the tape and in the hard copy bid me to save my own time by stopping here. Buy this tape."
1,Displeased,This machine slung sugar all over the kitchen and made very little cotton candy. Would not recommend this product.
1,it was cracked and flat inside,"The wok had cracks and the inside has a flat bottom, what kind of wok is that. IT GOT RETURNED!"
1,Don't Be Fooled by the Price!!,I was excited when I got a gift certificate from my hubby and kids for Valentine's day to amazon.com. I knew just what I wanted. After much looking I settled on the Philips CD and Cassette boombox. What a mistake! I've had it only a month and today I boxed it back up and I'm sending it back. The base boost is terrible. The sound is muddy and cd's sound terrible. The cassette player started playing my cassettes backwards! These are new cassettes and work fine in my car. The reception on the AM and FM bands were lousy. I was VERY disappointed with this product. I only hope I will get a full refund. This is not a good product. It looks better than it really is. Cheaply made.
2,Non-Toxic,"During the fall, the squirrels dig up all the plants in my small backyard, and sit on my fence and throw black walnut shells against the white paint on my garage, staining it deeply. I ignored this product for a long time assuming it was toxic and because I did not want to get rid of the squirrels completely. Once I realized it really was a safe mix that wouldn't kill everything, I thought it would be nice to try. And it is. I can put a very small amount on boxed plants and on my fence without scaring the squirrels out of the yard completely; the power of the black walnut tree overcomes all."
1,ugh...,this copy of the book was very different from the rest of my class. the page numbers were all different and even some of the content.
2,Yummy,I've made my own prickly pear syrups and various permutations...but this is just delicious and downright convenient! I'll be a regular customer! And we love their recipes!
1,i dont understand why this movie won the oscar,"this movie lack all attraction to the public because the bad edition of the scenes, the history is a mediocre play of the writer . the especial effects are lost in the threshold of profesionality. the drama drown with its awful documentation to the viewer. wich a half of hour of seeing the movie fall to a deep sleep and enter in the desperation to get out the cinema but didn't because of the money he spend and he had to wait the terrible anghish of the time remaining to arrive to my bed and trying to erase the terrible image of ""the beautiful mind"" please dont make a terrible film like this again to avoid wining the lord of the rings, wich is a new zeland film"
2,Can't be beat,"I don't usually like these kinds of movies. I am more of a Disney fan, but for some reason this one really tripped my trigger. I love how it is relatively clean, and has a fun balance between action, adventure and silliness. I pull it out whenever I need a good laugh."
2,Delightful music!,"The movie adaptation of this classic story was done so well by Disney (as if that would be a surprise to those of us that love Disney)...it stands to reason that the music would be fantastic as well. The original scores are so easy to learn and sing...I play this in the car almost daily for my children and we love to sing along. The music is moving to adults, and fun for children. I am sure that some of the concepts are lost on my little ones, but I know that they will come to learn the meaningful message this movie portrays soon enough. Right now they just love Quasi and Esmerelda. Quasi is a lovable character, but certainly not much to look at, which is why I love him so much. It shows that beauty is certainly the most vivid when we view it from within. What a wonderful message to send to our children in this world today, when looks and money seem to matter so much and the virtues mean so little."
1,Not what it appears to be,Pictures look good but product isn't. Probably a cheap thing from China with big mark up. Clasp doesn't work well either and is very thin. Save your money. Will probably never wear mine.
1,"Avoid at all costs....OK, anything more than $1.00","Rather than write a long review, I'll just say that this game is awful. I played it for 1 hour, and returned it. The graphics are OK, but the collision and everything else is horrible.Trust me, you don't want this game."
2,Confortable and convenient,"I have small ears, so headphones that don't go inside your ears are a must for me. These are very comfortable, even for long stretches of time. The retractable cords are great, and I even like the fact that they leak a fair amount of outside sound. I prefer to hear what's going on around me!"
1,How un-original,"I have not read this book, and could not give it a 0,but the reviews say enough. It is insulting, as a silent-film buff to see ""America's Sweetheart"" under a picture of Julia Roberts...sure, she's a great actress of OUR times, but Mary Pickford will always be remembered and live on through her art of film as the original ""America's Sweetheart."" Anyone who knows of Pickford's astonishing work will agree she set a new standard in film, and it is a shame her pictures are not more readily available on DVD. Some available on Amazon are: Stella Maris, Daddy Long Legs, Little Annie Rooney, Tess of the Storm Country, and My Best Girl. Also Highly recommended is Eileen Whitfield's Biography, Pickford:the woman who made Hollywood. For the record, I have nothing against Julia Roberts, but I can't stand such unoriginality in a title. Julia Roberts has always reminded me of a gorgeous homecoming Queen, who happens to be a very talented (and popular)actress in her own right."
1,Big disappointment,"The book starts well but after 170 pages I completely lost interest. The underwater scenario is very promising but the whole atomoshpere is destroyed by boring politics and all too sudden events. After a while I stopped caring for the main characters because their aimless wandering (very realistic, no doubt) was simply boring. I don't want to give any spoiler, anyone who still considers reading this book will soon know what I mean.This is not a real SF book and it doesn't come close to the great ""China Mountain Zhang"" or the moving ""Nekropolis"". Considering the hazzle to get this book in Germany it was a big disappointment."
1,Save Your Money - You Don't Need It,Everything you need is at the Prayer Shawl Ministry web site. I bought the book and visited the website by shawlministry.com amazingly similar but the book is by Lion Brand Yarn and Leisure Arts Publishing - the web site is by two women freely spreading God's love.
1,AWFUL,"This Movie was great if you like edge of your seat fright but as far as plot and storyline it came up short , it was very confusing and not well thought at all if i were the director i would have explained it much clearer it leaves you with the feeling of being unfinished and not very good at all i wouldnt give it even one star a half star would be pushing it and i dont usually rate movies so poorly but it was awful......"
1,Not worth it.,"I bought two of these on a lark. I told fellow gardeners they were just too silly to pass up; secretly, I hoped they would indeed be the Holy Grail of tomato horticulture, providing us with gorgeously full, green, fruit-laden plants like the one pictured on the box. I used the yummiest organic soil mix I could find, and the best fertilizer; hung them in a warm, sunny spot; watered them well... Yeah, you guessed it. I ended up with pallid, sickly-looking plants that produced a grand total of three tomatoes. True, as with any garden adventure, some undiscovered anomaly could have affected their growth...trouble is, I won't have the opportunity to try again next year, because the planter bags are already falling apart. I had assumed I'd get several seasons out of them; as it is, I'll be lucky if they make it through this one. More crap for the landfill...sigh. Next year, I'm asking hubby to make some nice, sturdy cages, and stick with growing tomatoes the old-fashioned way."
1,Overproduced and over here,"I had high hopes for this release, after hearing the amazing ""What Are You Afraid Of"" on an AstralWerks sampler. It is awash in psychedelic melodies, reverbing backing vocals and flavor, and manages to play over and over again in your head long after you've popped it out of the stereo. The rest of the album, unfortunately, is instantly forgettable, with no tunes to be found to match the refreshing blast of ""What Are You Afraid Of"". ""Trip"" and ""Northern Sky"" almost make it, but like the rest of the album they suffer from a glossy production that makes this sound like a B-level shoegazer LP from '91-'92. If you're still unconvinced, I implore you to sample as many tracks as possible before purchasing."
2,Almost Perfect!,"I find this CD so frustrating! The Lord's Prayer was the first LP I ever purchased, and it's impact and beauty have never left me. I had all but given-up every seeing it on CD until this reissue came along. Both LPs on one CD, how can you go wrong? You can't actually UNLESS you want the complete first LP. They left out ONE SELECTION (""O, My Father"") - probaby a time consideration. In any event, two great LPs, the remastering isn't much. It pales against the original LPs, but its great to have most of the albums."
2,"M*A*S*H - Goodbye, Farewell & Amen","I am a MASH junkie, and this is the ultimate MASH DVD. In addition to the ""Last Mash"" episode--which still holds the record for the largest audience ever for a TV show--the DVD includes the MASH 30th Anniversary with all the living members of the cast, and a Shelly Long-hosted ""Memories of Mash, which is very well done.If you like MASH, you will love this DVD."
1,Much ado about nothing,It is not often that a book comes along that a reader has personal knowledge about. In this case Ms. Kennedy has written a book of interesting self interest and little depth. Their is allot of outrage expressed but very little factual data to support the outrage. I agree with Ms. Kennedy on most of the issues but I only wish that she had documented her charges more completly. A missed opportunity. More smoke than fire. Guilty but not proven. Too bad.
2,A Wonderful Production,"It's true the RUDDIGORE is a problematical vehicle, but this production proves that, if properly handled, it ranks with the best of Gilbert and Swllivan's output. All of the major roles are particularly well cast and played, and the beginning of act two -- with the awakening portraits of gruesome ancestors -- is a marvel. My two daughters term this sequence the best Gilbert and Sullivan they've seen on videotape, and they've seen quite alot. This is the best of the four BBC productions I've seen on tape, and is wonderful fun. Don't miss it!"
1,Not for the music,"The music itself is great. Everybody knows Surfin' Bird from Family Guy and King of the Surf is a great track as well.However, my copy came pretty badly warped and I didn't even notice since I didn't play it for about a month after buying it. It was packaged well, so probably a manufacturing error."
2,Great product,"Nice case, fits the Z600 perfectly, includes space for extra memory card storage. Belt loop requires belt to be threaded through, I would have preferred a belt clip, but that's personal preference."
1,"THE SAD :( ""LET IT BE""","What goes up must come down.... It happened to Elvis, Michael Jackson, and the list goes on and on!even the Beatles in 1969 came tumbling down! This CD proves it.. worn out mad Beatles. Please give credit to Paul and Ringo however for putting out ""Let It Be"" Naked ...which did save this period for The Beatles."
1,Mickey Mouse axe,"This axe, while it may be the darling of those who insist that all objects be small and lightweight, is completely useless. It's too small. It wasn't that sharp out of the package. And, it would barely chop a 1/2"" branch. That makes it useless. Better to get a real hatchet, 14""-17"" long, with which you can split wood by swinging it. The positive reviews about this product were totally misleading, the whole point of an axe is the momentum you gather as you swing it. Otherwise, it has to be knife sharp, which it was not. It's also not heavy enough. If I wanted it for backpacking I'd still get the hatchet size and hang it from the backpack. I'm not an axe expert, but neither are the reviewers who rave about this tool, and I don't think it takes a certain skill either. It's just the wrong size for anything you'd want to use an axe for."
2,Hard to find,I bought this set back in the eighties and have been looking for another copy for years. This was my lucky find. Hours in the car listening with my daughter or was it me listening to it with her? I never tired of it and you all know how hard that can be.
1,Did I get a different book than the other reviewers?,"Because the book I have read was not fast-paced, passionate, the essence of romance, or erotic. It was corny, boring, and lacking - so very very lacking. The ""exotic"" and ""erotic"" dance was neither. It was embarrassing to bear witness to, as was all scenes between the two. That being said I did like Fane a bit. But there was no chemistry between the two. Also the writing is veeeeery explicit and we get to know all their thoughts and it is so very very boring to know all the characters are thinking."
2,Chester The out of work dog,"This book is fantastic! The book is about a dog who has much love for his job and his family. One awful day he gets fired from his job at the farm. In search of work, he moves to the city and he finds that it is a very different lifestyle."
2,"Yummy, Thirst quenching & Diversified","It's amazing to see how many different beverages have had spiritual applications in history, and how many ingredients in even modern beverages have magickal applications. I can drink my magickal energy any time I wish now... great fun and good magick"
1,Pure Garbage,"This author's book is garbage, pure unadulterated garbage. She makes false claims of what pleases a man, and how a lady should act. I had quite a few men take a look at the suggestions, men from all walks of life both corporate and blue collar workers, all agreed that the suggestions made by the author would make them turn away from a woman, not pursue her further. Perhaps next time this author chooses to write a book such as this, she should request the assistance of a male counterpart for him to tell us what males like, and makes them want to pursue us."
2,Best in class,"I've purchased a dozen or more books of this genre. This is the first that'd recommend enthusiastically. The ""workbook"" method outlined here is the fastest and most enjoyable I have experienced. Each building block is learned via a slick combination of visual ""tricks"" and vocal/written exercises that cement and connect them.This and ""The Guitar Cookbook"" are what I would now suggest to a niece or nephew moving up past simple chords."
2,Give it 2 listens,"This album is a cohesive concept album. You might need to give it 2 full listens before deciding what you think. This is not a CD that can be appreciated by listening to a couple of sound bites/samples.At first listen I thought it was quite (almost too) dramatic, but after the second listen it started to really grow on me.Now I can't get enough of it.Beautiful, emotional lyrics with a gritty heartfelt delivery.Great music - big, loud, and original. I appreciated this music even more after seeing many of the songs performed live.I highly recommend this CD to rock, pop, alt, and indie fans - you will not be disappointed with this sophomore release..."
2,Excitebike 64 is the best Nintendo game so far!,"Everyone loves this game, the graphics and the gameplay are really great. I agree with the reviews, this game deserves all the high scores it's getting. There are 20 regular tracks and loads of bonus mode including the original Excitebike, there's a lot of stuff to play. You can even play soccer or make your own tracks!"
1,do not use tis vendor,never showed up. I have been waiting for 3 months. the credit card was charged tough. there don't seem to have a problem taking your money!
1,Returned mine...,"Torch was not hot at all. Flame seemed weak and strangely diffused. Slightly tipping the torch would cause a clog and it couldn't be relit for quite some time. Seal between the torch and tank is the ultra modern material, cork. Due to this, the tank had to be cranked on very tightly to prevent leakage which I'm sure wasn't good for the threads. I wanted to like this because it's made in the area I live in. Having a job is always nice... lol. But, I would recommend looking at another brand. To be fair, I only tried this with propane. It may work better with MAPP. A multi-fuel torch this size should work fine with propane though, and this one did not. Could be mine was just defective..."
2,Excellent purchase,This book is a great source for freelance artists. You get company names and contact info as well as what these companies are really looking for. Be shure to read through the whole description before sending out your resume and/or portfolio.
2,Buy it while you can!,"This album - unlike most of Peter's impressive career - is a bit hit-and-miss. There's experimenting going on, but three tracks are outstanding. Catapult is classic Jefferies, with a lurching, drum-driven rhythm. The Other Side of Reason is a nasty little number that crosses Lou Reed with a homeless drunk. But the real centerpiece is The Fate of the Human Carbine, recorded with Robbie Muir. A surreal ballad that ranks as one of New Zealand's great songs."
2,movie you can watch over and over,This was a fun film to watch and its a feel good movie.Paul and fred are cool to watch since they are so cute. So if you ever get in the mood to feel good then this movie is the one to own.
1,"Good Product Advice, Bad Color Choices","Paula Begoun does give some good advice on products in this book. However, I must disagree in her assessment of what makeup colors a woman should and shouldn't wear. I don't believe that EVERYONE should stick to neutral shades and avoid blues and greens or other ""unnatural"" colors anywhere in their makeup. She adds this well intentioned but horrific photo spread of herself, showing how to put on makeup. The demonstration only helps to make her look muddy, flat and uninteresting. The excellent classic ""Color Me Beautiful"" by Carole Jackson is a better choice for makeup colors. Go for the rest of her advice but skip the color recommendations."
2,Loooove it!,"My daughter, one and a half, loves it. I find it one of the most entertaining children's programs around (for adults, that is), which is important when you have to watch the thing repeatedly. The stories are entertaining and teach good lessons. Sometimes my daughter will say ""dance"" and I'll put on the music videos for her. The songs are original and cute. I think my daughter has a crush on Max ;)!"
2,Bladerunner replacement rotors,Although better made than the original they are also slightly larger than the blades that came with the spiderman helicopter. I had to trim back the tail rotor fin to prevent it from continually hitting it. Works fine though.
2,Really total body,"These videos are really fun and challenging to do. Danceworks is the best exercise video I've ever used and I never get tired of doing it. The Northwest Ballet Company dancers featured in the video are inspirational and really look like they are having fun. The Angles, Lines and Curves video changes the pace and slows things down. I don't think it misses a single muscle in your whole body. I've found this is nice to do after the danceworks video as it stretches and moves everything. Body Tech, the third video, is a step aerobics video but you don't have to use the step to do it. I've never used a more comprehensive program."
2,I've used T-gel Shampoo off and on for ...,"I've used T-gel Shampoo off and on for many years when I have scalp problems, and have always found it to be very effective. I hadn't tried the conditioner until this Test Drive, however. I was quite happy with the results. My recent scalp outbreak was resolved in half the time as usual using only the shampoo, and it was gentle on my hair as well. I will continue to use it in the future."
2,Good,Exactly what I expected. I like the book. Well made and informative. Thank you. A ok A ok A ok A ok A ok.
2,I have the purple set,"I got both the leash & the collar in the purple set. The purple dyes between the 2 items are not exact but I don't care. I think hemp would be difficult to match exactly. I love the purple hemp on my white & black dog. He looks very handsome. The plastic clasp on the collar is still holding up surprisingly, despite my other dogs sincere efforts to chew it up! I dislike metal clasps as I have seen horrific injuries from them. So I will continue to run the risk with plastic. I am considering getting the rust colored set for my red merele dog, the blue colored set for my blue & white dog, and the green set for my red & white dog. I think they will all be quite lovely (sort of) matching! :)"
2,Unheralded Classic.,"This is one of the best action/heist films many have not heard of. Anyone who follows Michael Mann, and finds his style and substance appealing, will dig this. This is also James Caan at his best. Great soundtrack, atmosphere and writing. The seeds of DeNiro in Heat and Cruise in Collateral are here in Caan's Frank. The scene at the diner, in particular Caan's speech about his prison time are highlights."
1,Horrible product,To say that Minwax is falsely advertising re: this product is an understatement.It does not work. Don't waste your time or money.
1,No Heat,I've purchased 3 of these hair dryers over the past 3 years and all 3 no longer gave off heat. Each of them lasted over 6 months but from there it was downhill.
2,fun toy for grandma and grandson,"I bought this for my grandson because he had a great report card. We both set down and went through the instructions page by page and put it together. There were a couple of parts missing, but I intend to call the company and get the parts. He has had this toy for two weeks and is still playing with it. He wants another set of aqua raiders if his next report card is good. thank you kim"
2,Buy It,"I am not a music critic just a lover of all kinds of music and I cannot get enough of Jonny Reid. What A talent. I live in the US and hope he eventually gets close to me. In the while , I will continue to enjoy his fabulous music."
1,bar holding hanger punched thru,The fabric sooooooo thin the bar supporting the curved hanger punched thru the bag now the hanger portion slips out then all clothes pins fall on ground. Piece of JUNK!!!!
1,Zero to Sticky in 30 Seconds,"I bought this product based on the other recommendations, and price. We had been using Yes organic water based lubricant, which is fantastic, but expensive. Now I'm throwing this bottle of Pure Aqua out. It comes out of the bottle with a wonderful consistency but starts to gum up quickly. Don't waste your money."
2,Again and again....,"Over the years the Malory books have always given me a great read....I can't count the number of times I've read and these tales again and again.I can tell you this, I'm still not done with the Malory family...."
2,Webkinz site is full of great games,"My 5 year old likes the dog, but she LOVES the webkinz site. She has built a mansion for her dog and tends to it daily. The games are fun for her. We now have to limit her computer time, because she would stay on Webkinz all day long."
2,Eye lifting action!,"I thought this was a great movie and a lot of fun.The ""interstate"" chase alone was worth the price of admission."
2,Best Spring Pistol i have ever owned!,"I have a Walther P99 spring airsoft pistol and it is the best pistol I have ever owned. The grip feels awesome in your hand, so good I sometimes pick up the pistol just to hold it. The magazine is amazing it holds so much amo and is easy to reload in a matter of secounds. Thefield strip assembly and a slide release are awesome they make this gun very realistic. Some people when you first buy this gun will find the slide release a little tricky because if you cock the gun wrong it will catch the slide, but its not hard to release the slide once it catches. After owning this gun for about 2-3 years its still my favorite spring pistol and it still works very well I can't think of anything wrong with this pistol."
1,YOu and Me will HATE DUPREE,"I would rather have a root canel then watch this STUPID film again.I can't understand why these great actors agreed to do ""Dupree.""Even Michael Douglas?This DVD has to be over 2 hours of pure hell."
1,it sounds great!~!~!~!~!,it sounds great im just wondering y it did not already have 5 stars! di u think it would be great 4 my 12 year old?
2,BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"By far one of the best in the last few years. At first, i was reluctant to buy it because i'd only heard good comments about from friends. But then i bought it and at first, i didn't really like it, but, after listening to it again, my entire family and me loved it. Here's how i got five stars:1: lyrics: political, good rhymes: 1 star2: beats: groundbreaking, amazing: 1 star3: arrangement: good: 1 star4: Backup vocals: awesome, could have their own careers: 1 star5: Guest artists: All good, even cam'ron: 1 starif you have good taste, get off the computer and buy it!"
1,"Been There, Read It","A bunch of nonsense from ""experts"" who claim to be in the ""business"" for years, which probably means they went to ETS.ORG and read about SAT's and SAT II's and then went to a few colleges' websites to learn about admission dates and guidelines. The book is a real snoozer, empty of vividness, insight, or help. If my parent read this and then tried to relay this drivel to me I would sue for Child Abuse. Pay attention in class, go to a few websites, consult the trained help who have expertise at your school, study vocab, and leave this where it belongs: in the No Sale area in your Shopping Cart."
2,night before chtistmas,great christmas book. just like the one i had as a child. my kids love it. given as shower gifts and new to be moms enjot the book
2,"Open My Eyes, Lord: A Practical Guide to Angelic Visitations and Heavenly Experiences","This book was a blessing to me. It helped me to further understand some of my own experiences. It also gave me a hunger to see heaven and desire to have God's Glory revealed. I loved reading this book and I had a good time with the Lord while doing so. His presence was there and I felt as if the timing was perfect for me to read this for the things the Lord is doing in my life.Thank you Mr. Oates for writing of your experiences, it was a blessing to me."
1,"""I've got a bad feeling about this""","Ok people i'm just gonna stretch out with my feelings on this one. For 9 months i played SWG ,and spawned 4 kick butt toons on 2 different accounts. So wicked even big ""V"" would have prolly given me the nod, but this combat upgrade they shoved down the playing communities throats was a bit much for me to handle. I'll always be a star wars fan, and i will never purchase another soe product again. Yes the playing experience has become that bad......""I'd rather kiss the wookiee"""
2,"This book was pretty good, although I liked #1 better.","I liked this book a lot, but I thought that #1 ws more exciting"
1,Pointless gadget,"Though Maxim is a fine company, this particular gadget is completely pointless. It is far easier to make crepes in a traditional, low-edged, non-stick crepe griddle. This gadget does nothing except complicate the process."
2,Unforgettable,"I remember reading and absolutely loving this book when I was young (and let's just say I am definately not young anymore, yet still absolutely love it!) The attention to detail and intricate story about a future society will really grab any reader, young or old. Over the years I have thought of it and made attempts to find and purchase it without success. It became my ""white whale"" of sorts, and I am extremely glad to have finally found it again! It is a book that I will pass around to friends and to future generations."
1,Flat Footed,If I was 14 years old I MAY have enjoyed this book. In fact I think it WAS written by a 14 year old. Really stupid and in my opinion poorly written.
1,Missing Parts,"All I received was the sander without a bit (called a drum sander) and a bag of five small 1/4""sanding bands. So I paid $7.00 for a Drum sander and shipping and handling. I rceived the bit or drum sander with a 1/2"" sanding band. Now I will have to order more of the 1/2"" bands since I cannot use the 1/4"" bands which came with the tool.I recommend that Amazon drop this product from its inventory."
2,Quite tasty,These work fairly well... no bad chemical aftertaste like I would expect. It would be nice if they were cheaper tho.
2,"Great memories, some question marks....","For the most part, this is an incredible collection of songs that I haven't heard in a really long time. While I honestly cannot remember some of the songs ever being worthy of the title ""hard to find,"" most of the CD did bring back some good memories of good friends, and times when we could actually understand the lyrics of the songs that were popular at the time."
1,DOTS FUZZY TYPE,I agree with the comments below. Type appears to be fuzzy and no settings will change that for me. (followed the advice below too and to no avail. It is however the best setting though) I am returning for something totally different. Any recommendations for a graphic designer who works in Photoshop and Quark? Type is a huge deal to me - needs to be CLEAR!
1,A Beatles documentary without The Beatles music?,"I second the opinion of another reviewer who also gave this film one star. Whatever artistic reasons film makers had in mind, it is simply impossible to make a decent film about the Beatles without including a piece from their song. And it smells cheap! I'm not well informed Beatles expert, but I know the names of George Martin and Derek Taylor. No words by these people, instead all film is based on interviews with two-three others who were indeed witnesses but in no way took part in the Beatles art.This is a budget film, do you want it or not. And the Beatles deserved something better."
2,Jeffery Zeldman Speaks--Better Listen!,"When I bought Zeldman's book I expected to get a clutch of juicy Crimean War Stories about web design. What I did get was a supremely practical guide to using web design painlessly and effectivly. This is a useful book which answers tough, intuitive questions that nobody else knows the answer to (and will never admit it). For instance, what is the best way to make your text look good on the internet if you are handling it from an ""Illustrator-type"" of image? Why does CorelDraw/Photopaint default to saving images for the web in 96 dpi? There IS a reason, read this book and find out what it is. Want to use CSS? What unit of measure is the best for text? Once you read this book you will KNOW. If you are a beginner or an intermediate web designer, this book is right up your alley. Don't miss Taking Your Talent To The Web--it is a classic from a wise man.-"
1,Didn't even want to finish,I had heard good things about this book so I got it. I read into it about halfway and just couldn't take anymore. It wasn't holding my interest. I found it quite boring.
2,Real wood!,I so appreciate that this set is real wood. They're well-thought out and easy for a child to set up and play with. Not as big a deal as the playhouse structures but fun.
1,It's not easy!,I disliked this product. Simply because IT IS SO DARN CONFUSING! Really! I couldn't figure this out! I guess I would only recommend it to someone who knows technology!~Kristina
1,Gordon Lightfoot Complete Greatest Hits,The cd was excellant. Brought back a lot of memories of long ago. Concerts with friends on a Saturday night.
1,Just bad,"Movie lacked any real funny moments. The idea was a bit cool though. If this idea of the old scout master dieing in the woods and his son taking over was done in a serious note could be great. But a movie with a bunch of kids and couple guys just swearing the whole time at nothing, quite terrible."
1,Amazing amount of talent down the drain.,"It bugs me when all of the resources that went into making this movie went into making a contrived, unreal, banal, obvious mess. There's a terrific story by J G Ballard in the middle of this movie and Spielberg missed it. Instead he pasted together a bunch of flat movie cliches. Then got Tom Stoppard to write the script. Got Malkovitch to overact, probably not that hard, actually, and got John Williams to roll out the heavenly choirs, the tense percussion, I'm sure the whole lot of them know that this movie is a sell out, and feel a little nauseous whenever they remember what they did here. An amazing amount of talent down the drain. A shame."
1,Spyro Art Pen not worth unpacking,"Seemed like it would be fun, probably would be if it wasn't a piece of trash. Comes with several refill inks. That's good since it runs out of ink after 2-3 drawings. My 8 year old would need the skills of Picasso to make this do anything. The old Spyro Graph had a perimeter piece to give it shape, this is just a pen out of control. Don't waste you money!Spyro Gyro Motorized Art Pen"
1,Disappointment!!!,This was not what I expected. I very quickly tired of the focus on selling light bulbs.
2,Great Book for the Young (Me too),"This book spins a tale about a family living through our Revolution. Well written and easy to read as it ties one families life into contact and involvement in our fight for independence. My only complaint is some illustrations would have been appreciated. That said, I liked it a lot!"
1,Don't buy this Fan!,"This type of fans is working for fresh air only and it doesn't work for exhaust!The add is misleading also it is noisy!Holmes 7 Twin Window Fan, HAWF2021-U"
1,Funeral Director Shirt,"The shirt was oddly shaped, it did not fit in the bust or the arms...I have NEVER had a shirt fit so strangely before. Would not recommend the shirt to anyone."
1,"Rubbish, tossed it after continuous disappointment","While stylish and ""cute"" as others have mentioned, it simply did not hold heat very well. It doesn't seem very well insulated at all, and after my third luke-warm lunch I threw it away. Seems like a thermos is just one of those things you can't scrimp on. I've since invested in something a little more substantial."
1,A Disappointing Reunion For Sure!,"Wow! I bought this CD for a few bucks used and I still feel cheated. I expected so much more from this 1996 reunion (short-lived) CD and got so much less. Tracks 1,3 and 4 have started to grow on me but as another reviewer pointed out, the rest is mostly unlistenable. I don't know if Journey toured to support this album but as I was listening I found myself imagining the lukewarm reactions of concert audiences everywhere as Steve Perry announced ""and now we'd like to play something off of our new album"" ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz. I recently saw the new Journey in concert with current singer Steve Augeri. It was great. He sings like Steve Perry used to be able to sing in about 1980. My recommendation is to skip ""Trial by Fire"" and go straight for Journey's 2001 release ""Arrival"" with the new Steve."
2,My Favorite Luna Bar,The Luna Toasted Nuts and Cranberry bars are my favorite. This is one of the few flavors that does not contain chocolate or yogurt coating. And these bars are not too sweet.Great for a well-balanced snack at home or on the go.
2,A different type of action flick!,"If you liked a movie like Pulp Fiction (I believe it was from Tarantino too) you will definately like this film. It is sliced into chapters that are each individual stories which do not happen in sequential order. Each chapter is excellent in itself (one chapter is done in animation) and the only reason I didn't rate the movie higher is the time sequencing sometimes gets confusing and by the end of the movie you still don't understand what happened to have Uma Thurman's wedding party attacked.The fight scenes are very unique and extremely gory, though a lot of the blood looks like colored water from a sprinkler. Tarantino has a lot of tributes to Bruce Lee such as using the Flight of the Bumblebee song (theme of the Green Hornet), having several of the villians wear Green Hornet masks, and having Uma wear a Bruce Lee type body suit (a la Game of Death) in the grand finale fight sequences."
2,Why go with Monster?,"The cables in this package are all of excellent quality. They're heavy and don't feel as if they'll break, come apart, or otherwise malfunction due to less-than-gentle use. The picture quality is amazing, giving you clear, crisp pictures with no artifacts or other signs of a poor cable quality. Having seen both Monster cables and these, I can tell you that they appear the same. So - why spend a hundred dollars on -one- cable that gets you the same result as a full set of cables for half the price? I'm currently using the component cables (between my DVD player and TV), the HDMI cable (between the cable box and the TV), and also the composite cables (for th VCR). All of them are excellent!"
2,"""Laundry Service"" shows Shakira's unique style","Shakira has succeeded in creating an innovative style that is unlike any other genre today. In her CD, ""Laundry Service,"" she mixes pop, Latin techniques, and even Arabic influences. In her song, ""Ojos Asi,"" she fuses Arabic lyrics and music with her own unique style to create a work that is not corny at all but rather one of the CD's best songs. Using a variety of instruments and rhythms, Shakira produces all of her own songs and lyrics. Her voice is part of her superb style. When she sings, her voice is completey real and her lyrics are even more genuine. This is something that most female ""sensations"" of today cannot say. She sings beautiful ballads in both English and Spanish. Three of her songs on this CD have become hits. Though not all of the songs on the CD are award winners, most are good and more than half are of superior quality."
1,Poor Polish,"In my search to find a healthy nail polish, I purchased this brand and color from my local health food store for $9.50. To say that it is poor polish, is an understatement. It started fading and rubbing off about 2 hours after I had it on. By day 2, you could barely see it on my nails anymore. It streaked terrible. Overall, very poor quality and I don't recommend it."
1,Two of Three Failed On Delivery,"Not much to be said. I'm the landlord of an office building that for some strange reason (thick concrete wall, probably) has two rest rooms with the light switch outside in the hall.Needed a light with sensor to keep folks from being plunged into darkness while seated on the toilet, in case some practical joker flipped the switch. Or the electric goes out.Bought 2, one didn't work on delivery.Amazon made return painless.Replacement didn't work on delivery.Getting a different brand."
1,Needs replacing too fast,"I, too, find that I have to replace the cartridges WAY too fast for the small amount of printing I do -- and cartridges for this model are NOT refillable.I have to replace the magenta and yellow cartridges again, but when they're empty I'm buying a better printer."
1,This product is sooo stupid,"The Zen Micro looks cool when you buy it, but don't be deceived by looks. This stupid piece of crap doesn't even work. It crashes any time you touch it and you can't even get muic on it because it crashes every time you download a song."
2,Not that Bad!!,"From the reviews, I was expecting this CD to be alot worse than it was. I think the kids just sound like young kids. I'm glad I bought this CD. I will listen to it year round. The Bradys are outta site!!!"
1,Durable but really uncomfortable,"Summary- go for another set of earbudsI bought these for work, so have only used them sitting at a desk connected to a laptopPros:- Sound quality is fine (not amazing, but not bad either)- Cords are very durableCons:- Extremely uncomfortable- They don't stay in my ears (and I've tried every size)- The cords are really stiff causing them to stick out awkwardly and get in the way"
1,This company makes faulty monitors,"Another reviewer wrote: ""I wanted it to work!"" and so did I! One of the parent receivers never worked and when I called Safety first they asked me to send it to them and they'd replace it but ""it would take a while."" Two months later the second receiver died, and I still hadn't replaced the first one. I called and asked for a refund and they tried to convince me to pay for shipping it back to them! If you buy this and have problems, DEMAND that they send you a return postage label! After I got rid of those (still no refund yet, by the way!) I purchase a Safety First monitor at the other end of the price spectrum: $16.00 I know, WHY would I do that? Long story...but the end result was: THAT DIDN'T WORK EITHER!This company has poor quality products."
1,If you read and love the books dont bother,"This pathetic excuse for a TV show took one of the greatest fantasy series ever created and completely ignored the story for the sake of a TV show.Do yourself a favor and dont watch it, read the books instead.I stuck through the first season because it was mildly entertaining, but when the second season came along and the writers decided to make the Stone of Tears a magical stone rather than the fortress and capital of the country of Tear I could no longer bear it."
2,The Stone Maiden is a Must Read ! ! !,"<sigh> Susan King is a remarkable, uniquely-talented author. She shares her Scottish devotion and knowledge in a sweet, memorable way in the story of Sebastien and Alainna in The Stone Maiden. From the first dreamy scene to the last, you will love every page-turning moment of this book. If you listen real close, you may even hear the bard's harp weep as the story of The Stone Maiden unfolds. I truly enjoyed this one!"
2,"Wayyyy too short, but it JAMS!!","I have been a Petra fan for almost their entire existence. The past few Cds I was pretty disappointed in because it lacked the ummph of CDs like Unseen Power, On Fire, Beyond Belief, and Wake Up Call. So, I was browsing around a Christian bookstore and saw they had a new CD out. The packaging had me curious (the black with the white and red lettering as well as the title had me wondering if they had finally returned to their hard rocking days). I started listening to it an was BLOWN AWAY!! The only thing I could say to myself as I was smiling from ear to ear was ""they're baaaa-aaack"". I of course HAD to buy it and the ONLY negative thing I can say about it is that is WAY too short. Its like i just get really into jammin and all of a sudden its over. My only hope is that they will continue this hard rockin trend and give us a little bit longer songs and more of them. Welcome back guys!!"
1,one of his worst,"The difficulty King always has had to write a proper ending has now progressed to the point where is no longer able to write a proper book. This book should have been written as a short story, with a nice open ending. Now its one of his worst books."
2,The Best of the Pack in the Overall Series,"After reading all the books for far in this series, I have to say that this is Turtledoves best book to date in the series. The action is fast and the book has a pace that keeps up well with the action described in the book. Some of the books in the series lagged a bit and suffered for it. Not this one! The pace keeps building up faster and faster. One can feel that the series heading for a bang up of an conclusion! Just a pity that the series will end when he finaly has (at least for my taste) perfected his style with this sereis!"
1,The Way She Was...,"I saw this show both in las vegas when the album was recorded and in los angeles at the staples center. I am not too thrilled about the song selection, but I guess she had to include the New Year's stuff and Simple Pleasures since she had to differentiate from the great Concert last time around. The Staples Program was a lot stronger and her power was just amazing. The biggest disappoinment for me was that she couldn't see fit to sing Stoney End. If she could do Main Event, she could have gone done the Stoney End one more time, if for no other reason to get a performance of it on video or DVD."
2,Great tool and buy,I purchased 4 of the thumb saver tool sets as Christmas presents. I have used the tool to hold a nail in place in out of the way places where it would be awkward to hold and then strike the nail. The tool works as advertised and the DIY network did a great job making me aware of the tool. I will continue to use the tools and avoid those painful hits to the fingers and thumb. For a home do-it-yourselfer the tool is great.
1,minus 10 stars; author knows nothing of Deleuze,"I am stunned that the book was published by a University press. I stopped reading it; the book was that dreadful! The author seems incapable of understanding Deleuze, although he could comprehend Michael Hardt. Furthermore, the author is anti-Deleuze--a fact that the title disguises."
1,DISAPPOINTED,BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS ONLINE... I WENT 2 MACY'S AND SPRAYED IT ON... LOVE IT... PURCHASE FROM U... DOES NOT SMELL THE SAME...!!!... I PURCHASE 2 BOTTLES ... NOT HAPPY AT ALL... VERY UNHAPPY CAMPER.... SEXUAL....!!!..JAMES........jwdisnuke@att.net
1,I did not get what is shown here,I thought it would pug into a USB like shown in the picture but it did not.
2,Kayak storage,I purchased two units too hang my kayaks tight against my garage ceiling. I needed to do some modifications since the bike hooks didn't work for this application. I swapped out the hook pulley for another straight pully to hang clips off of it and webbing. This worked well although I could not use the cord locks since that required pulling the rope from directly underneath the pulley and the kayaks were in the way. All in all is was cost affective approach and worked well when complete.
1,Thin bottom does not heat evenly,"I needed to replace an Analon covered saute, and many reviews indicated this would be comparable quality at a more affordable price. But the aluminum is very thin guage and does not heat evenly. If this were a $20-$30 pan I would call it good value, but I expect anyone spending $50 or more for a pan would expect better. I certainly did."
2,Excellent Abridged Copy,"The quality of the recording is not in question. It is a great story as told by miss Davis. However it is not the entire book, it is an abridged version so if you are looking for the entire story, hard copy is the best option for you. Very enjoyable overall."
1,Please don't tell me this is where we are headed!!!,"This was one of the worst books I have read in years. Carrie and her twenty-something (and forty-something)peers are all sniveling whiners or frosted ice machines. They are flat. Then, all Ms. Packer's trivia which led me at about page 100 to ask ""who cares where the dishes are in the sink?""Carrie, Kiljoy, and Mike were so uninteresting, I couldn't even dislike them.It was like a really bad soap opera novel, I skipped ahead several pages at a time and didn't miss a thing."
1,"Way Too Overrated, Among Other Things","Way too long, way too blue, way too nothing like the original Philip Dick story (far superior), way too formula Hollywood, way too much crap. Two stars for a couple interesting visuals, but that's about it. If you want Philip Dick done right, go Blade Runner, go Screamers, and then go Total Recall (yes, big budet Hollywood action, but it still retains a good Philip Dick core). Minority Report just sucked."
1,just dont get it!,"OK...maybe it really is me but i just dont understand most of these raving reviews. I have been using Amazon to purchase the majority of my books mainly because of the reviews. I trust the reviews and most of the time they are in sync with how i end up feeling about the book. This time however, it was not the case at all. maybe i'm not used to vampire/romance genre..but i just could NOT get into the dialogue and i really really couldnt get into the characters. So, from someone who loves Romance novels and is pretty open minded, i DID NOT like this book!"
1,Stand barely fits,"I would not recommend this mobile base. The planer stand barely fits, the legs are 1/2"" off of the base. Also there is no way provided to attach the stand to the base. It would seem to me that this base is made for a different application, or the engineer that designed it never attempted to put the stand in the base. At a price of nearly $100.00 I expected a much better fit. Personally I would recommend puchasing a universal base at around $50.00 and making it fit. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because it is well constructed."
1,"Vague, waffle about life after death.","I was very disappointed and would not give a child such vague waffle. I suggest the author reads ""The Thibetan Book of the Dead"" or some of George King's brilliant teachings on life after death. As a child I was fortunate to be surrounded by people who were equally as keen to apply their intelligence to life as they were to death. As it is such a vital subject that affects us all, why do we continue to deal in child-like analogies. There are enough excellent books around that tell us otherwise. Richard Christian Matheson's book is an excellent one for example, based on serious study. We would not be so vague and woolly about our finances, why do we insist on being so about the afterlife, I wonder? Although children should have things simplified they should be told the truth."
2,Hard Eight is worth your time...,"This is by far my favorite of PT Anderson's movies. It is interesting, retrained, and sharp. The characters are fleshed out and are extremely human. This movie shines in how its characters relate to one another. Very enjoyable. I also like this movie because I feel this movie is about the ""story"" and not about the parlor tricks employed in his later works -- Boogie Nights a little while Magnolia is full of them.If you liked Boogie Nights, I highly suggestion this movie. If you haven't ever seen a movie by PTA, make Hard Eight your first choice. It will warm you up to his style of film-making. And finally, when you see Magnolia - you can ask yourself, is this the same director who did the wonderful movie ""Hard Eight?"""
2,a terrific scrapbook of horror,"I've found that Boogeymen was more than a compilation as the cover suggests, it turned out to be more of a scrapbook of the 17 films featured on this disc. Boogeymen included - Production info, trailers, commentary, bio and history and even a game. A great DVD especially if you want to go beyond just the entertainment value."
2,Enjoyed,"I thoroughly enjoyed this video. I wouldn't have a problem watching it over and over again. I'm so impressed with these three guys' incredible talent at what they do. I wouldn't have a clue of where to start at something like that!! They deserve all the credit they get and more. I'm very happy that, finally, they've received the recognition that was LONG overdue."
2,I Love This Thing!,"I bought this bread maker over a year ago and it hasn't rested for more than one week since then.I am an extremely lazy cook, with the crock pot and microwave being the cornerstones of most of my cooking endeavors. Shockingly - to me, anyway - this breadmaker has fit right in. I just dump in my ingredients and forget about it until the timer goes off.This unit has seen plenty of work while I've had it and has been completely reliable throughout. I have yet to see an under or over cooked loaf of bread and I haven't encountered a single hitch. A great product and I am very glad I bought it."
2,Kapla!,Sent this to my 10yr old grandson for Christmas and by Christmas afternoon I received an email with a photo of the fabulous castle he built...He LOVES his Kapla blocks!
1,bad buy,"This was one bad buy. Didnt think it would be such a bummer. I will not buy it again. They haven't put enough wax on these strips, so it takes out some and leaves some... Lesson for me....ALWAYS READ CUSTOMER REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING ANYTHING. {I had skipped for this one)"
1,Not great,"Many of the keys have a slight bend to them. Some of the keys seem to be sized slightly too small (can cause stripping). The case, although an excellent layout organizationally, is low quality and the tools sometimes pop out of place. Overall, the set feels cheapy and I don't like it."
1,Probably Morrell's worst,"I've read several of Morrell's books and have become quite a fan. While I've gradually given up the thriller novels, I still like to read Morrell for his clever plots and skilled writing. This book, however, was a severe disappointment. Sure, the plot was decent, if a bit more far-fetched than Morrell tends to be.My biggest problem was the dialogue. Morrell is too talented of a writer to let him off the hook for this. None of the dialogue is natural. Rather than describe things in the narrative, he uses the dialogue. It was painful to read.Check out Brotherhood of the Rose and Fraternity of the Stone, two of his best."
2,Fantastic For Non-Noisy Environments,"I have these and the more expensive PMX 200s. These are way more comfortable and sound great as well (the PMX 200s edge them in terms of performance, but at a comfort and monetary cost). Very good headphones for the price.I use these while working my desk job, which is perfect for me as they do allow quite a bit of ambient sound. If you're planning to use these in a noisier environment, I'd look elsewhere. But, if you're looking for a comfortable set of behind-the-head headphones for a rather quiet environment, these are a great choice."
2,Good bang for the buck,I now have two of these Channel Master CM7777 antenna Preamps. They have a quite good signal to noise amplification compared to most other antenna amplifiers and preamplifiers on the market in a similar price range. We still receive one low power analog TV signal in our area and it does very well with that station. It has a much cleaner picture than the old distribution amplifier we were using.
2,For children,"this book has beautiful and detailed pictures that children can discuss. It is a bit lengthy, so wouldn't recommend for under 4 years."
1,No no no no!!! (Please see additional comment!),"You do NOT want to purchase this mat if you have any traffic at all on it. You can stand comfortably on them, but do not walk around a kitchen with them on the floor!! Mine are two years old and after one year, they turned up at the edges, making them unsafe. The time I most need these are when we have family, and I'm in the kitchen a lot. Unfortunately, that's when I have to take them up because I cannot risk people tripping on them. For the expense, these are not worth the risk. Buy padded shoe inserts instead. They'll last longer and be safer!!(The above comment was THEN. This is NOW: See the comment I added below.)"
1,"VERY INCOMPATIBLE, TECH SUPPORT LANGUAGE BARRIER.","PURCHASED THIS CARD TO MONITOR OUR STOREFRONT. ERROR MESSAGES ON INSTALL 15 SECONDS INTO IT. WAITED ON HOLD FOR SUPPORT UPWARDS OF 40 MINUTES, THEY WERE NO HELP. THEIR REMEDY WAS TO REFORMAT. CALLED 2 DAYS LATER, TALKED TO A DIFFERENT PERSON, HE WAS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. WE WENT THROUGH 45 MINUTES OF INSTALL THIS, DOWNLOAD THAT, MOVE THIS, REINSTALL THIS, THAT, THIS, NOTHING WORKED. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED."
2,Very talented!!,"I got this cd the day it came out and like it more and more every time I listen to it. Her voice is so beautiful... I find myself letting her sing me to sleep night after night. ""All I Want is You"" is a great song! Highly recommended."
2,OK Product,Probably better for maintenance than killing an already rampant Algae problem. The price is right so I will use it for periodic maintenance. I will put in more of this than I would any other Algae product though.
1,Look Elsewhere,Very little help concerning water dragons. Better information can easily be found on the internet. Next to useless for the beginning water dragon owner.
2,A Good Read,"As usual, I can always depend on Nora Roberts for a good read! I really enjoy her, and her characters are so real."
1,A Comfortable Wife - too comfortable - enough to be a yawn!,"As an avid Stephanie Laurens reader - this book was just not up to par with her other books. I loved her Cynstar series books, but I really had to struggle to finish this one, and when I did I was disappointed. If you love her other books - I suggest that you pass this one - it is not up to the Lauren's style of sensual storylines with well-thought out characters."
1,This CD is NOT for the serious listener!,"I'm going to offer this CD to my dentist, as I think it's the sort of thing you would want to play for someone while giving them gas... It's pleasant enough if you want background music that won't distract people from their conversations.I had expected music that would stir my soul, but this is a contrived collection of worthy compositions, toned down to mere melodies and jazzed up with mis-used percussion. There's no depth to this music.It seems the people who most enjoyed this CD were those who associate it with very real, very positive memories of their own experiences. I don't mean to disparage their opinions; it's just that, for me, the music must stand on it's own merit."
2,Thick and strong compactor bags,"The only problem is that there are no holes at the top of the bag to anchor it to the compactor can. When the can starts getting full, the bag is pulled into the can. I fixed this by cutting 4 little slits near the top of the bag so I could attach the bag to the anchor buttons on the can."
2,"MOH Allied Assault, with two bonuses","I liked this product. Just got back into the shootem up games. The only problem I have had is the graphics. Background buildings, etc. fade in and out and are white or grey until they become closer to the player. I must need a better video card. I am currently looking for one."
1,the wedding dress,I wish this would have a little more back bone. Maybe I just like longer movies. If it were a little more meaty with a little longer plot it would have been a great movie. Instead it leaves you hanging and saying what?
2,Xbox 360 wireless network adapter,"I unfortunately bought my Xbox 360 before the elite version which has a built-in wireless function, but after buying this product, I'm now able to go online with my 360 and have a lot of fun! This is a great product!"
2,Great movie,Loved this movie. Great story and actors. Great message as well. Movie arrived on time and in great condition. Donald Sutherland was great.
2,Best brushes for tangles!,"These are the BEST brushes for tangles! My kids have thick, wavy hair and it's a struggle to keep it brushed. We used to have tears and tantrums about brushing my daughter's hair. This brush has saved my life, and the morning routine! I have multiples since I can't afford to misplace it, even for one day! BEST BRUSH EVER!"
2,My friend said I smelled like a hippie,"It smells good, like roses but there's also some other sort of incense-y smell that is quite strong. It's not overpowering, but I would agree that I did definitely smell like a hippie."
2,Fallen Heroes,"As you are reading though the tribute to the fallen, you see thenamesof each of the lost Firefighters scrolled across the bottom of the pages. Each page left me more and more with a sense of loss. I did not lose anyone that fateful day, yet, we all lost. The words you read are quite moving, the pictures mean more than the words and poems. Yet i am most moved by the names of those precious and brave firefighters name across the pages from the front cover to the back cover."
2,Worth Watching,"Boy, has television advertising changed over the years.If you are used to the gloss, color CGI ads that dominate the tube today you'll be shocked at what ads were like when television was first starting out.What they lack in techiclal details these ads more than make up for in how creative they were. They clearly didn't know what would work and what wouldn't so they tried every different type of approach they could think of.The quality of the footage is surprisingly good considering how old the clips are."
2,La mejor afeitadora del momento,"Yo llevo casi 2 años afeitandome con la Fusion Power y afirmo que es la mejor afeitadora del mundo. Yo uso cada cartucho 5 veces, y afeitan bien hasta el ultimo uso."
2,WoW!!!,"Being an avid reader I didn't think that I could be surprised or blown away by a new thriller. This book is the one. A must read for any person who likes their hero a little tainted, confused and human. I had to take a day off of work because I couldn't put the book down. I hope my boss doesn't read these reviews. Every one who reads pick up this book. If you don't read books start with this one, it will hook you on reading for life. Wow!!!"
2,Upbeat and catchy,"Hot Show has got to be one of my favorite CDs of all time. It's full of catchy songs that will stick in your head for days. I, like most people, saw 2 of their videos (I believe they were ""Sucks To Be You"" and ""Strange Disease"") on MTV2. My friend bought the CD and the first time I heard it all I was hooked. Since my friend and I live in different states, I copied her CD so I could listen to the songs until I bought my own copy. My personal favorite is ""Europa,"" but the big hit seems to ""Sucks To Be You."" ""Strange Disease"" is also a very good one. There are even a few slow songs and ALL are good for dancing. Besides, who can resist Simon's charm and Milo's....well...just buy the CD. The songs will haunt you and leave you sleepless if you don't."
2,"Every "" want to be author"" should read this book",Most first time authors know ZERO on how to write and sell their first book. This book tells you how. If you are even thinking of being an author- get this book!Rick Frishman Pres. Planned TV Arts (NYC) Co-author GUERRILLA PUBLICITY & GUERRILLA MARKETING FOR WRITERS
2,A Good Begining to a Great series,"Having just finished the entire Homecoming series, I can honestly say that it was the 2nd best (Tolkien will always be first) fantasy series I have ever read, and this book is a good start. I actually got to the final chapter and didn't want to finish it beacuse I didn't want it to be over with. The series gets better volume after volume and builds upon each earlier piece, sometimes in ways that you don't even notice until later. Some seemingly insignificant events at one point seem to become critical later on. I think that I'll be reading a great deal more of Mr. Card's work as soon as I get over this one being finished. Don't be fooled by the 4 star rating: if possible I would give this book 5 stars, and add 1 for each following volume."
2,A small book with a big message,"This is a great book to own if you are already familar with Yoganada's works. I keep this in my bookbag so I have it wherever I go. A great read when you have some spare time at work or waiting in line. It's very small, but the message is HUGE. Yogananda has a great way of explaining how God, the metaphysical, and all life are interconnected and how YOU can achieve God-Realization.I recommend first reading Autobiography of a Yogi. After reading that book, don't be suprized if you start picking up this jewel and others that he left us."
1,"Wah, Wah, Wah,","I'm Richard Chesnoff, and I hate France! Ooooh, look at me, I wrote a book about it. 208 pages of me complaining! I even tell how to insult them! Look, now you can say ""Are you ill?"" to an arrogant French man just for not smiling at you! Illogical, you bet it is!Yeah, what? Come on, this is mindless junk. Snooty French people, not supporting the war, and pampering every American tourist. For that, Richard Chesnoff must complain.This god-awful book should never have been written. Someone please get him (Chesnoff) a fresh diaper, or maybe we'll be treated to ""The stupidness of Bulgaria, and why the feeling is mutual""."
2,"""...Burned Spy Continued!""","...Michael gets into it again when he has to do a job for his new handler and accidentally burns another spy named Jesse. Well Michael and the gang take Jesse into the fold to help him find out who burned him (Jesse), all the while using Jesse to try to find the people who burned Michael. Somewhere along the lines Jesse finds out it was Michael and turns against him for a short time, then realizes he needs Michael as much as Michael needs him! Throughout the season lots of cars explode, several people die and in the end Michael and the gang do their thing and it looks like Michael maybe back as a Government spy (they leave you hanging for next season- Michael is in D.C.)...Stay tuned, I sure will!"
1,Spare your kids the suffering,"I ordered this for my younger brother who needed to read a book over the summer for his school. We picked this book because it seemed interesting but we were both very disappointed.I would describe this book as boring, dull, and overly pretentious. The most exciting part of the book was finishing it. I'm not one to read books that do not interest me, but I had to finish this one because I told my little brother that I would.Don't buy it if you love your kids."
1,Not useful at all!,"These CD's are nothing more than someone reading the lectures in the Textbook and the Workbook, nothing more. I thought that I was buying the Student Audio Program that accompanies the Workbook, which this isn't. I suppose that someone might like listening to someone just speak the language, but that is all this is. You might as well turn on the television."
2,Kindle book,This was a dailey Amazon special. It was a great book and was better than the advertisement. I enjoyed it thoroughly.
2,You owe it to yourself to read this book first and then pass it on to your children ...,"I have quite a few books on the subject of the ""mis-education"" of people in the western education system and this is one of my favorites. It sits right up there with ""A Peoples History of the United States"" by Howard Zinn. James Loewen is very informative, direct and easy reading. Therefore while your child is attending school and being brainwashed with the nonsense the school system serves them in history class you owe it to yourself to read this book first and then pass it on to your children."
2,keep a wrench handy,"Just took this on its maiden voyage with our two ""cruiser"" style bikes today. went about 25 freeway and 20 rural road miles and no problems. This rack required minimal assembly and was easy to adjust to fit our bikes.One thing I believe a few of the others have mentioned. Keep a wrench handy, You will need it to tighten the threaded hitch pin enough to make the unit ""wobble free"". This is the only reason it did not get 5 stars.The best thing is how easy it is to load the bikes and remove them once you have it set up. I would recommend this to anyone that owns something other than a straight framed bike.Update 7/13/2010Used this rack to transport our bikes to Falmouth MA and back from Columbus OH. Approximately 820 miles each way. Never at any time felt like this rack wasn't going to hold them.I used a couple of small locks in the holes designed for them in the ratchet arms to keep them secure from theft as well as a thread locking hitch pin. I would recommend this rack to anyone."
1,"Typical biblical sexism:barefoot,pregnant &unworthy to lead","Sexism disguised as praise. I hated this book.When are women going to understand that as long as they believe that the bible written by God and not by man, we will never have equality. Ever. Women are their own worst enemies. I would not recomment this book to anyone and am highly suspicious of it's ""rave reviews"""
1,valeo ball,"When i received this item not only did they send me the wrong type of air pump so i could not inflate it; after trying various of other pumps i realized the item was defective, the inside of the ball was made wrong and it was all stuck together so there was no way to inflate it with any type of air pump. By the time i realized it was defective the expiration date of sending it back was over due. I would say if you are looking to get an exercise ball do NOT go with this one choose a different one"
1,"Sound again, Terrible & no CC","I remember the days when movies and tv didn't try to blow your brains out with sound effects and background noise. The days when even commercials were tolerable. I hope somebody out there gets it, it makes for an unpleasant experience. With CC encoded, it wouldn't matter as you could mute the sound and read the dialogue."
2,Be Warned,"I have an older G4 running under 10.3.9, and unfortunately I cannot run the program with any degree of enjoyable effectiveness. It does run, but very ssssssslllllllloooooowwwwwllllllyyyyyyy.Make sure you have a fast Mac.The programme is okay, but I liked the other `contraptions' programme by the other older company (still in business?) that ran under OS 9."
2,Ravensburger puzzles are of wonderful quality,"If you enjoy puzzles, this is a wonderful one. It is extremely educational and appropriately challenging for a variety of ages. The border is easier to assemble, with the map a bit more difficult, and the satellite photo being the most challenging to finish. This was a great puzzle for the entire family to work on."
2,Great LP - now I have it digitally,bought this on first release - only on the basis of the original producers!!! It never grabbed me at first but year after year I kept coming back to it. Americana before it was so called. Then when I went digital I was very pleased to track down a copy (albeit no cover etc) on ebay.
1,So REDUNDANT,"I loved Steel's early works. I read them all and they were great but have stopped reading her because her books are repetitive now. I decided to try once again just to see and this book was maddening!! It was 178 pages long and could have been all been said in 100 pages. It was obvious that she was stretching it to make it a hardback ""novel"" length to sale. Skip it."
2,Truly befuddled...,I look forward to going in to work just so I can puzzle and laugh over the day's quote. I just wish that our dear Oz Prime Minister could so confound us!
2,wonderful,"This book is great, full of wonderful information, and it is an easy read. The shipping was super fast and the price was really good as well!"
2,Works nice; quick shipment,"I ordered those since the originals from iRobot were back-ordered. They arrived quickly and work awesome. The picture looks a little bit different, but the actual filters are exactly like the originals."
2,Extremely Sturdy Cot,"The Outfitter XXL Cot from TETON Sports puts all the others to shame. My son is 6'5"" and it supports him well. This is great for scouting, camping and hunters. It is made of quality materials and sets up easily."
2,Wahl Professional 8061 5-star Series Deluxe Rechargeable Shaver Shaper,"Brutha's.. it's okay. It doesn't give me a close shave like I thought it would. Can't get it to cut the deeper hairs, the ones run flat against my skin and eventually curl back under to create the bumps. This is even after I run the shaver multiple directions. Still have to finish with my Andis line trimmer to get a closer shave. But one thing I've noticed is less bumps, so it seems to be working for that. Another thing that's helping is Kiehl's Ultimate Man Razor Bump Relief. It costs a grip but I've had the same bottle for two months, use a little morning and night and it last a while. good luck"
2,great gift,Got this for a relative and they loved it. Had it for several years and just replaced it for one with a bigger screen; still use it as a back up.
2,powerful message,"I really liked this movie and the powerful message it sends. Even if you are not ready (or never will be ready) to quit animal products altogether it will probably make you add more organic produce to your diet. I thought the makers of the movie achieved the goal of educating people and bringing awareness to the diet as a source of our energy, health and well being."
2,Good value for the $$,"Well-built with spring type restraints, foil shielded cables and 24K gold plated connectors. A fraction of the Monster cables cost and does the same job."
1,"Predictable, simplistic and boring","I found this book to be so predictable, the story line was too simple...there was no depth to the story or to the characters....and I had a hard time sticking with it. The whole story focuses on this woman's issues with her own father that she then transfers to the father of her student. How do they fall in love? I haven't a clue because there was absolutely no story there to give that scenario any meat or background. I'm just saying.....I see the author has other books...I hope they are better for the sake of those who buy them."
1,Rip Off,"This edition DOES NOT contain a table of contents, which makes it impossible to navigate and totally useless overall.Save your dollar and look elsewhere."
2,Wisdom in a Miniature Package,"This booklet is for everyone, but a perfect gift for new graduates. It is full of quotes from writers, educators and scholars. Easy, short quotes from many famous commencement speeches, makes it readable any time for relaxation. The tastefully done fun pictures add to the effectiveness of the book. The inspiring statements are about the accomplishments of the graduate and the life-path waiting for them. Thoughtful statements that will keep the young generation assured, plan life for the long term with courage and faith, learn from mistakes, not lose the lessons learned, maintain a sense of humor, and move on with individuality, compassion for others, and make the best out of oneself.Here is a great book of encouragement for graduates and all others."
2,Worth the price,"This is the third of these devices that I have purchased. All of the others had weak fittings for the hose or the pole that loosened in the middle of using the device. This made use of these other devices frustrating and time wasting. I have a large pool. With this, I can clean my pool of debris in about 15-20 minutes. It is a valuable partner to any owner of a pool with any source of debris nearby."
2,Great Movie,"This is a good movie, but don't watch it if you have never seen the TV series.I have fouind both movies wouldn't be that good if you don't know the back history of the characters involved.Still this is a very good movie for the price."
2,Excellent,"This package is a total treat for Magazine fans. Some might look at this collection and think that they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel but actually I would call this the best collection of Magazine's material, even better than any of their albums. The track selection is excellent and the sound is as well (live tracks etc.). Fan of Magazine? Save some bucks and pick this one up; its an amazing collection from one the very best post-punk bands and one of the most interesting footnotes in rock history."
2,Dewalt batteries,I used the batteries for my Dewalt sawsall and my Dewalt drill. After a chargeto make sure they were fully charged I used them in contructiong an addition tomy deck. They both worked great and as I only had one before it was a welcomerelief not to be switching batteries all the time. Now I have three and lifeis much simpler.
2,Great History of the Middle East,Mrs Albright has a strong grasp of Middle Eastern history as well as Islam. A good quick read by a very moderate voice.
2,A great Sci Fi classic,"When the end of the world is revealed mankind makes plans to carry on on a new world, but not all can go and those left behind decide that they should go instead."
1,Pan and Scan? No thanks!,"Rats. I was all ready to buy this movie, but the ephemistic ""Full-screen format"" (i.e. Pan and Scan) stopped me cold. The reason I bought a DVD player in the first place, besides the great running commentaries included with many movies, is so I could see the entire image the director intended, not some cropped 4:3 editted-for-television version.Call me a purist, but I just don't buy cropped DVDs like this one."
1,Okay,"I got this for $6, which is why I did not return it. Item was not new as stated, with no seal and bubble wrap. The actual pitcher itself is pretty good."
1,This is a terrible book,"Not even badly researched ... it seems to be un-researched. Offers nothing new. Steals cleverness and cachet wherever it can, but lands flat. The audiobook is read by the author. How many times do we have to say it: HIRE AN ACTOR ... HIRE SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO USE THEIR VOICE. It isn't expensive and makes an enormous difference. Locke's voice is monotone, soporific, and seems designed to simply drive coffin-nails into his tired material."
2,Great value for the money,"So far so good, the only complain i have is with respect to the wire bruch which has very short brizzles and since the handle is straight and not angled when cleaning or scrubbing the hot grill it is a real pain with the heat from the grill. You will need a heat resistant glove when using it."
1,worthless purchase,"This book did not help with any preparation to attempting the CCS cases, your best option would be to print out the read out material provided by [...] and follow each each thoroughly in order to grasp the general gist and order of managment. I didn't find this book helpful at all. It was overpriced where I could have used that money to just extend the bank for the CCS cases."
2,Great Table & Chairs!,"I absolutely love this table and chairs. It is well made and easy to put together. The chairs are sturdy and the legs on the tables and chairs are easily tightened. I can't imagine a better set of table and chairs for the price.I had bought this set for my 10 year old when he was 7, and he still uses it as a desk. He won't give it up even though it's getting a little small for him. I also purchased one for my 2 1/2 year old who is not quite big enough for it, but he loves it too. I like it because the chairs are sturdy enough for me to sit on."
1,Too small,"This puzzle was to be used by a person who has had a hemorrhagic stroke. The puzzle is too small; the pieces are too small. This puzzle or something similar could be purchased at our local dollar store. However, the subject of the puzzle was nostalgic and with great beauty; reminiscent of Vermont/Massachusetts."
1,dissapointin,Ud think after five years theyd come back with quality material ... sadly not its my life and one wild night are barely ok the rest is garbage dissapointin and i thought their first two albums were incredible .. where are those rock anthems shot through the heart etc.....
1,Support the troops!,"For those looking to expand their Blu-Ray collection, please consider that some films actually DEVALUE your collection.You'll be spending the next 10 years always having to explain to guests, ""Whoa, How'd that one (or twenty) get in there?""...And every film will have to be watched ""Clockwork Orange"" style - with eyes forcibly kept open. Actually that's a good idea - I'm buying these for Guantanamo in case they outlaw waterboarding. Support our troops!"
2,A Brilliant Tapestry of the Human Condition,"In his fictional debut, Bernardo resurrects prerevolutionary Cuba replete with the sights, sounds, and odors of Havana's barrios, as well as its earthy lifestyle. He follows the fortunes of the butcher Maximiliano and his well-born wife, Dolores, who with their four children, come to the capital to make a new life after a hurricane destroys their entire village. Using the bulls of the title as a metaphor for the swaggering machismo of Cuban men, Bernardo turns this family saga into a brilliant tapestry of the human condition. Love, gossip, jealousy, fear, wisdom, sacrifice and death all swirl around Maximiliano and Dolores as their children grow up, leave home, and come to terms with their individual natures. The dignity with which the author imbues his characters and his engaging conversational style make for a wonderful novel. It should be a hit in most fiction collections. opyright, LIBRARY JOURNAL, February 1, 1996."
2,Psychological Thriller,"The story is told initially through the eyes of Holly Krauss. I liked the insight into her thinking as the world fell down around her. She is on a manic binge leading to a disastrous one night stand with serious consequences for her marriage and business. Her business partner Meg is a wonderful, loyal and ultimately life saving friend.It's a story about how a life can unravel and what we think we have isn't real. The ""perfect"" world of Holly seems to break apart so quickly. I enjoyed the insight into her interior life.A good book for thinking about why we do what we do and how we relate to others."
1,Another Dumb Business Book Destined For The Bargin Bin,"The premise here is that there is only one way to think about business. Hahahah Give me a break!!! Here we have a book that is all about marketing and salesmanship. A catchy title, neat colors on the cover and the blurbs on the back all say buy me. But what is not as cleaver is what is on the inside. It is the same old stuff that one thousand business books have said before. How boring!!! How dumb!! Think about that one will ya."
2,This is going to be great!,"My 8-year-old son loves playing games so why not make it an educational game. We didn't actually play the game yet. I was asking him some of the questions to see how hard they would be. As long as they asked about the location of a state, he was okay. This game is going to be great for the years to come."
1,Don't get bitten! Not the Right Brown Recluse,"This is not the same Brown Recluse who made the recently released and terrific EP ""Soft Skin"" and whose song ""Night Train"" is a free Amazon download on 9/20/09. This Brown Recluse is a rap artist. It seems to me that with all the resources Amazon has, they could figure out that more than one artist sometimes has the same name and guide their customers accordingly. I've encountered this problem several times."
1,Stiff and scratchy,"I just can't fathom all these positive reviews... the reviews gave me the confidence to buy the sheets, and after carefully washing in cold water and a cool dry, they came out thick, stiff, and scratchy. They're just not smooth and soft at ALL -- after washing a couple times. What a disappointment. How in the world is this ""sateen?"""
1,DO NOT buy from them,This is NOT the item you will get when you order form them.You will instead receive New Chapter BLENDED Tamanu and Olive OIl. What a scam!!!
2,Almost A Vigilante,"Pronzini's nameless detective is by his own admission very much in his own likeness. Nameless is a big Italian who drinks beer, smokes a lot and collects pulp magazines. Pronzini claims that his hero also has the author's same personality and values. Nameless is Pronzini if Pronzini was a private detective.Nameless verges on becoming the vigilante while working on this case, but he catches himself in time. He also operates outside the law by practicing without a license, witholding evidence, breaking and entering, and failing to report a homicide."
1,Comments from the Spiritual Reviewer,"Learn to Love is an elaborate, work-intensive program for keeping the stereotypical dream of special love alive. The complicated, multi-factored approach recommended by Jaksch does not uplift and leaves you tired and overwhelmed just reading about it.The strategy proposed by Jaksh is to pre-empt the experience of disillusionment by setting up relationship expectations in a very thorough and controlled way. Then there is no confusion. Each partner knows, accepts, and hopefully performs in a way that he or she is ""supposed"" to perform. While it's true that there is great power in knowing exactly what you want, it's also true that love cannot be defined, contained, or imitated by the human ego. Therefore, learning to love is more a function of undoing rigid definitions and expectations rather than installing them.This book received a score of 2.5 on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) from the Spiritual Reviewer."
2,Great Film!!!!,"This is the start of a revolution. ""Before the Music Dies"" is a great look at the state of the music industry today. It covers everything from the pre-packaged pop singers, to the napster craze, to great artists that you'll nevr hear about.With insightful interviews from Eric Clapton, Dave Matthew, Erykah Badu and many others, you'll understand why it's been called ""a film every music fan needs to see""!!!!!Please check out this film and then pass it along to your friends and family and hopefully it will spark a change!!!"
2,No more being the last one to eat!,"I ordered this griddle because I was tired of being the last one to get to eat when I'm making pancakes for my family on a Saturday morning. Problem solved! This thing is great, despite it's size, you had better have a large cabinet to store it. I wanted one this large for being able to cook a pound of bacon at once, or make 8 pancakes at the same time. Anyway, I love this thing, and the way it tilts, the grease from cooking meats runs off into the tray. If your looking for a griddle, and you have the room for this thing, don't hesitate!"
2,Great instructional tool,"This is an excellent book for both teachers and tutors alike. I use it for both remedial and enrichment for the many different levels I am tutoring. The ""Putting It All Together"" chapters at the end of each unit are really great. The answer to each question is given along with the corresponding lesson so the student knows exactly which skills need to be practiced. I would highly recommend this outstanding book."
2,HOT!!!&#128526;,"Loooove these... stylish but not too much, I could pretty much wear these everyday but I don't cuz I don't want to wear them out."
2,Exceptionally well made,"This movie requires patience. There is no gripping storyline that edges you out of your seat. There are no profound messages weaved into the dialogues.But once you understand that, you'll find that the storyline in Yi Yi might surprisingly be like your own. There is no central theme to the movie. Nor do the characters suddenly experience life changing events in the course of a few weeks. Other than a wedding, funeral, and a child birth, very little changes in the long term.But isn't that how real life is? Problems aren't really solved - they just pass over time. And it just might be mundane events of family life that defines who you are as a person.With each viewing I have grown to appreciate this movie even more. The new 2005 DVD edition is beautifully edited and is much, much better than the 2000 version. I watched it during a rainy day when there were no distractions. Highly recommended."
1,"Are you all deaf, or what? This thing is LOUD!!!","I thought I was going to wake the neighbors (and the dead). Sure, it's nice to have a sturdy metal base, instead of the usual plastic, and maybe it's reassuring to have a good-quality two-speed switch instead of fifteen flimsy buttons offering everything from ""shmush"" to ""Fargo"", but does it really have to be so loud? Simple, beefy motor design is one thing; zero sound isolation is another. This seems to me like the worst of ""retro"": an old-looking design that behaves like maybe it really is just an old design. The blades don't look terribly sturdy - I wonder how they'll hold up in the long run. Not that I'll wait around to find out: I bought mine last night and am going to return it today."
2,a great series with wonderful actors,"i really loved this series. sad that there are only two. love denis lawson - had first seen him in bleak house. fun to see him here in a very different role, but think he is one you will want to see in any role he takes on. and the same can be said of pauline collins. she is wonderful. a strong woman of conviction who handles the irish/english relations with great wisdom and a woman's touch, which sets the chauvinists around her on edge. very well-written."
2,Nice,Looks great and fits nicely in my punch bowl. Just the right size to fill the punch cup. Used it to have a sangria party.
1,SACD limits use.,"Great music, one of the greatest rock record ever released. I bought it to replace my original LP. But I am disappointed, nontheless, because I cannot load this disk onto my iPod. It plays, as advertised, on my CD player at home. I suppose it will play on a SACD player, if I ever get one. But it will NOT play on my Mac G4 Powerbook. I use my iPod to play my music when I am walking to work in and in my car. I thought about returning the disk, but I will keep it. However, I will not buy another disk with this format."
1,"Collection of amplifier circuits, but no theory or design.","This book is just a collection of amplifier circuits from magazine articles and manufacturer databooks. Each circuit is accompanied by a description, ranging from a sentence to a paragraph. There is no discussion of amplifier design or theory, although some of the circuit descriptions contain brief explanations of the topology. I was very disappointed, because I wanted to learn about amplifier design. If you are just looking for a circuit, this book might be of some value, especially since it lists the original sources for all of the circuits."
1,Not what its title implies!,"This video is 50-plus minutes of step aerobics with a little bit of arms and abs thrown in. If you're looking for a fast and fun workout with a focus on toning arms and abs, don't bother with this video."
1,don't buy it,This clock does not function for teaching a child analog time. The hands do not move separately and you cannot get an accurate reading of hours and minutes.It only frustrated my grandaughter (and me).
2,Best book I have read about the Five Points of Calvinism,"Edwin Palmer does a good jog explaining and defending the Five Points of Calvinism. I recommend this book to any person, Calvinist or Arminian, who is interested in learning about this topic."
2,Good Quality for the price,"I bought this vanity set for my 12 year old daughter because the style matched with her bed. It arrived a week before they said it would, was very well packaged with all parts and hardware intact. It was very easy to put together and looks just as the picture showed. The quality was what I expected, it is made of metal tubes that are pretty sturdy. Be advised that the ""silver"" finish is painted on and is more of a gray than a stainless steel silver."
2,Fit perfectly ... 10 minutes installation,This is the Philips PHI/A1601743A to replace the Sony XL-2000U. It took me 10 minutes to install. The original Sony lamp lasted over 6 years. This one has a 180 days warranty ... just have to see how long it will survive ... cross my finger.
1,crappy,totally crappy and I now let my dog sit in it. its looks cool for that only. do not purchase this if you do shame on you
2,"Factory Recons seem to last longer, as least for me.","I'm really liking this gun. I've ordered quite a few factory reconditioned tools and have never been dissatisfied. They seem to last longer, at least they do for me. The feature I like the best on this gun is that you just drop the nails in the back. No need to pull the knob and then insert the nails. Drop them in the back and pull handle back. I'm thinking now, it's basicly the same movements but it seems easier. What the heck, it's easier then the older models. As far as breakdowns go? I've never had any with a reconditioned tool. I suggest, go for it."
1,Shun electric knife sharpener,Poor quality product. It is cheap probably as it is made in china..wouldn't recommend this product. It has nearly broke my shuns knife edge...
1,"Good concept, but weak connector.","The dual volume controls are a great idea. I love ear cover headphones, the wife likes ear-buds and the mismatched types meant volume levels were never right. This little cable solves the issue when two folks are sharing media. The issue I have is the input plug is not designed for even the lightest of tugging of the cable. The entire plug seems to start coming apart after just a bit of use.. If the input is redesigned, this would be a great device."
2,Excellent product,"I really appreciate the battery and cord free convenience. The mouse glides over the pad like it is skating on ice. The only downside for me is that it does not have an OS X driver, so I had to buy SteerMouse which does not enable the second scroll wheel."
2,Good song selection.,Purchased for my wife for xmas and she said it has a very good selection of songs and the right amount.
2,Beautiful Crib!,Crib was easy to put together and looks even better in person. Very happy with this purchase.
2,Two Sci-Fi classics at par with Star Trek,"Star Trek has been a fan favorite for a while, but I think that Buck Rogers and Battlestar Galactica (specially) were two Sci-Fi series that racked right up there with it.Battlestar specially did a great job. It had an unoriginal story line (lost in space/have to find home type of thing), but presented it in such an original and involving way that it really grabbed the audience. You really cared for the characters. You really wanted them to find Earth.It was Ulysses' adventures for the future, and I know that you have heard it before, but it also WAS ""the Star Wars for the small screen"".Some of the characters are now classics Lorne Greene as Adama, Dirk Benedict as Starbuck (did the coffee giant plagiarize?).As for Buck... well Buck was Buck. A likable, funny and just plain fun television series.Overall, to all that love space travel Sci-Fi, and who haven't been exposed to these two great series, this is the perfect tape to buy."
2,The Power To Influence....................,"What one star reviewers seem to have missed is that these top 100 people have the power to influence and influence negatively. Their thoughts do nothing good for your family or America. Fortunately, we have always had censorship in our home.I say BRAVO Bernard Goldberg! You have hit a home run."
2,Great System,Easy to set up with my Powerbook. I have a second computer hooked via Ethernet and printer also. I'm able to work in one room and don't have to run back and forth to print. A great time saver!
1,Somewhat BORING,This story did not keep my interest and I had to force myself to finish this book. I hope the other books in this series are more interesting and romantic.
2,An amazing story!,"I must join in on the praise for this wonderful memoir. Li Cunxin's account of his early life in China was so vivid that I literally shed tears for him. Later,I found myself cheering his brilliant successes in the ballet world. I could not put this book down, as I felt compelled to find out what was happening to Li Cunxin. The pages of pictures contained in the book added much to the telling of this story. You must read it."
2,The Case for Privatization,"If anyone has any doubts about the overwhelming benefits of privatization in Latin America, they should read this book. As politicians like Kirchner, Morales and Chavez to a certain degree argue against what they see as the social cost of privatization, this book clearly shows that if the goal is to have increased state revenues aimed at social spending, privatization will more likely than nationalization bring that about through increased tax revenues (private companies in general pay more taxes than state companies), sustained job creation and reduced liabilities such as public debt accumulated by inefficient money-losing state companies.The authors and editors deserve praise for having produced a well-written book on the topic, with ample documentation and no political agenda beyond looking at the myths and reality of privatization in Latin America.(This is an excerpt of a longer review I wrote in Latin Business Chronicle, March 2006)."
2,amazing,"This movie is amazing. Very well acted. Very romantic. A wonderful story of friendship and love. The actors had chemistry, I watched this move 6 times already. The best gay love story since brokeback mountain."
1,Drivers,I tried to install the drivers but cannot without a CD/DVD unit that spits out a loader. I could not get my front loading MacBook Pro to read it and I could not find the drivers on line. - Until I get help it's wasted money.
2,Great game for kids to learn about money,"My 9 year old got this for his birthday and he loves it. He wants to play it all the time. The game has a ""shortened"" version or regular version, but the shortened version still takes a good half an hour to play, but atleast the game doesn't go on forever! I think monopoly games are a great way for kids to learn more about money!"
2,Gnomep & Juliet was GREAT!!,The movies arrived promptly and was in great working condition!!! The movie was very funny and I cried at the end.
2,In Pursuit of the Shroud: Astonishing Scientific Discoveries!,"In Pursuit of the Shroud is an amazing documentary revealing scientific evidence gathered on the Shroud of Turin. The main goal? Discovering how the image was formed on the Shroud. Several different view points within the scientific field are presented, giving a thorough approach to solving this controversial mystery. What they find will astonish every viewer!"
1,I Don't Think So!,"Quite often, bringing a classic story like ""Moby Dick"" to the screen is a thankless task. But at least John Huston's 1956 version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances (even Moby Dick looked a lot more realistic in 1956!). This version just doesn't make it - skip it and buy a copy of Gregory Peck's rendition instead. You'll be glad you did."
2,Excellent for cleaning cat boxes,Works great to keep smell of litter boxes out of the house. We sift from litter box into bag and then store in diaper genie.
1,Save your money,"The book is printed in huge font, thus when it first arrives it looks impressive, but on opening you realize that it could be fitted into a much smaller package. And dont forget the appendix of the 430 data sheet...The content is woefully lacking, just above a very basic introduction.Save your money and buy something else, when you do find a goof book on the Ti430 let me know, I'm still looking."
2,A Great Opportunity to Laugh at Ourselves!,"""Borat"" skewers all manner of ""political correctness"" en route to a laugh-ridden look at ourselves - feminists, church-goers, frat boys, those predjudiced against Jews and/or blacks, and politicians provide Candid Camera opportunities for silliness that take advantage of our normal efforts to be polite and tolerant of others from a different background.Definitely a ""Must See!"""
2,Such a wonderful book,"I read 99 Newfies shortly before I got my first Newfie. It is such a great insight into this wonderful breed of dogs, and will help prepare you for the goofy Newfies in your life.The stories are short enough that you can just read them here and there when you have a few minutes to spare -- but they are so good that you will want to read them more than once. A book you'll never want to get rid of!The perfect gift for anyone considering a Newfie or just dog lovers in general."
2,Lum Rocks,"Lum has to be one of my favorite manga titles, but then and again, I adore the works of Rumiko Takahashi. I think of Lum as the Archie comics demented. I reccomend it to everyone!"
1,What a stinker!,"For those of you thinking you're going to get an insightful look into Ancient Egypt through a well-written work of historical fiction, stay away. This is an extremely amateurish book. For one example, the author insists on telling us about the characters, using long strings of adjectives, instead of letting them speak for themselves. It's ridden with cliches, impossible to get involved in, and composed in the style of a very cheap romance. The publishers should be ashamed of themsleves."
2,Wonderful treatment on how the universe supports one's dreams,"This is the perfect book for someone embarking on a new adventure or chapter in life. It should be required reading for every new graduate for its simple, but provocative, take on trusting one's instinct and listening to God for divine advice."
1,"I would have given it no stars, but they don't let you.","I'm sorry, but this movie is just dull, I don't get the point of it, I know it's supposed to be backstory, but why, why would I care why and how Darth Vader is created, he is what he is in the only three Star Wars movies there are. I still think the jokes made that George Lucas writes these Prequels as he goes is true, and the simple fact that he is actually going to end up having to redo parts of the original three movies is irritating to say the least. I say it's all about money plain and simple. Did anyone actually care about the storm troopers? Why would you, and come to think of it, why would they even need officers in a clone army, it just didn't make sense and the story dragged and dragged. One other thing, one second Yoda is floating, another he is hobbeling like an old man, next he is bouncing off the walls like a 10 year old on speed and pcp, the power of the force is sure a magic thing. A magical annoyance."
2,Awesome,"The first time I heard this CD I was in complete awe. Absolutely wonderful music. The album starts quite slow and melodic (Duende), turns very emotional (Silence) towards the middle, and then slows back down again before the end. If you want some great background music that isn't too cluttered, yet is very deep, this CD is as good as you can get. If you looking for a more light listening experience, look elseware."
2,"Not the best, but still loved it.","Obsessed fans of the books like myself waited in anticipation of this movie for over a year. While I will admit it is far from being my favorite movie ever I have to say that I still love it. After I saw it the first time in the theater I thought ""well, it was kinda cheezy but I still enjoyed myself"" after a couple of days I started getting the ""Twilight Fever"" and wanted to go see it again. As of writing this I have seen it three times in the theater and enjoy it more every time. Most people I have spoken to seem to agree that it gets better each time. I think if someone watches it for the first time they have to realize it is not some big epic movie with huge battles and amazing CG. It is just a simple love story about a girl and a vamp, and isn't love always a little cheezy anyways? :)"
1,A hideous waste of time & money,"It's very, very rare that I stop reading a book, and with this one I didn't get past page fifty. The main character is two-dimensional and annoying at best and the intereactions painfully stereotypical. The arguments are like bad Mamet: frustrating to read and you know where they're going to go before they get there. Do yourself a favor and buy some other book."
2,Wonderful Sounds,"I am a big fan of En Vogue and Toni, Toni, Toni. My husband is a big hip-hop fan of Tribe and bought me the cd as a birthday present. It's been two weeks now, and I can't seem to get enough. The melodies are original, soothing, refreshing, and very different from the current trend of ""pop R&B"" you hear on the radio. A must have for every R&B fan. My prediction: 2000 Grammy for Best R&B Album!"
2,Made a difference,"I was pleased with this product, after having it on in a room for a few hours, the air felt cleaner, less dust-laden."
1,NEED SOMTHING THAT WORKS WITH MINI SD,"it is hard to get the mini sd card to fit in right, but you know you did it when the light goes on. After that my computer never recognizes it. I have ordered numerous amazon products to do this and i cant find one that works, even on my pc. i had one that broke during use, and thats the best i have gotten. does anyone know of one that works for mini sd, especially on a mac?"
2,Pretty good book,"Instead of writing yet another book about Albert Einstein, Bodanis wrote about his equation. Although a biography of an equations seems far fetched, Bodanis accomplishes it by introducing the viewer to the scientists who provided the parts of the equation (the e, =, m, c, and 2). By delving into the lives of the men and women who made the equation what it is, Bodanis draws the reader into the story, making it not yet another dry physics book.A minus: the book itself is only 200 pages, but it contains 100 additional pages of notes on the text."
2,Like new,"I was a little worried when I purchased this item as I needed a reliable, long-lasting battery for my Razor phone. I had read that some of the replacements were ""old"" in terms of shelf life, even if labeled new. I am happy to report that this battery works as well as the OEM that came with the phone and now I can relax and stop watching my battery meter. Great price - I bought two."
2,Superb Quality & sound - the best money you'll spend,I can't be more pleased with these. I purchased teh Logitech ones last year but it was clunky and the plastic headphone piece soon broke. These are a little wobbly but I'm just so impressed overall and these are priceless. Give yourself a treat and enjoy!
1,Not much fun,"I bought this toy for my daughter at about 7 months old. She has always been able to easily remove the suction cup from her high chair tray, then the toy quickly gets thrown to the ground. She never really got into spinning the various objects. Despite all the good reviews I have read, this toy really didn't keep my daughter's attention."
2,Superheros and Spam,"This isn't one of those sad, heartwrenching books about kids with cancer. It uses humor, anecdotes, and superhero references to express how strong these kids really are. It offers a peek into the lives of children with cancer, through the eyes of a camp counselor. It's a must read for everyone, even if you don't personally know a child with cancer. It reminds us that there is more to life than what we take for granted. This book makes you look at kids with cancer differently. Not only that, but I now look at Spam as not only an alternative food product, but as an endless source of entertainment! Hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!"
2,Six year old son loves it!,My six year old son (who at times is six going on twelve) just loves this CD. He must play it every night when going to sleep. Its not babyish but it is still youthful and full of simple joy.
2,"TurboCAD 7 is great on features, poor on documentation","I had great hopes for TurboCAD 7, but was disappointed to find that the user manual was mostly dedicated to one 2D drawing, and how to use the included FloorPlan 3D features. IMSI advertises the software (including in the box illustrations) as being great for mechanical 3D drawings, but gives you precious little help in learning to use those functions, unless it is to draw floorplans, and 3D housing designs. If I'd wanted to buy FloorPlan 3D, I would have bought separate architectural design software.Their excellent included training module is a come-on to BUY two more modules, locked on the CD. They take you part of the way there, and then you find yourself at a virtual toll booth.I know the capabilities are there. I came to Amazon.com hoping to find books on TurboCAD 7, but there seem to be none available. If I ever learn to use the program's powerful features, I'll upgrade to the new version 8, now available."
2,You can rearrange Elvis to spell: L I V E S,"Embarrassed to admit to friends that more than once you've done an elvis impersonation in the shower? I was just wondering. This film may be for you. This short film is a one of a kind video GEM. You will impress your friends, family, and neighbors by showing them a most unique documentary all about elvis fanatacism. Mondo Elvis is a staple for anyone that loves Elvis, hates Elvis, or just has an appreciation for all things tacky and in poor taste. If you like Roger and Me, American Movie, or Blue Hawaii--you must buy this film NOW. This is also a wonderful film for professors of Sociology, Social Work, Religion/Philosophy, or American Studies. In only 25 minutes you can't help but have a conversation about identity, counseling interviews, or how Elvis and Jesus might be related. You will not be disappointed.-Treeboy"
2,Sharpening Kit,It's a little work to sharpen knives; not really sure if the electric one would have done the same.
2,The Prayer Cycle is today's food for the soul,"This CD gave me comfort in knowing that others too feel compassion toward a struggling humanity. The lyrics are strong and inspirational, the music powerful, yet graceful, and the voices passionate and honest. Jonathan Elias is a visionary and The Prayer Cycle is a miracle."
1,Wat the??,"Look, ive been a fan of Linkin park since day one, ive supported every single thing theyve done even that fort minor [...], but come on!! this is ridiculous, never has a band gone so pop and mainstream in the matter of one cd. There is maybe one good song on it, but wait no , there isn't, leave the politics to the politicians, if you want make political songs then hey be my guest, but dont expect me to listen, all i can say is that linkin park just lost A LOT of fans, including me. I hope this is the last time they attempt to change and be what they are not, which is a crappy band"
2,Excellent recipes!,"This is by far the best Italian cookbook that I have ever bought. I have tried dozens of the recipes in this book and have enjoyed each one immensely. Most of the recipes are quite simple, the ingredients are easy to find, and the end products are delicious. I've used this cookbook at least twice per week since I bought it over a year ago--this is one that will never collect dust on your shelf! I've also given this book as a gift to several friends and family members & they have all loved it as well. Very simply put-- a must have for any fan of Italian cookery."
1,shipping,This was the worst customer service I have ever had. When I ordered the strap the shipping option was super savor and when I received it the shipping was $29.95. Be very careful when ordering from this company so you to don't get this type of fee added to your credit card without being advised.
2,Life changing,"This is the book that began everything for me. Okay, so I was already living in the city--I had moved in as poor college student--but I hated it. I wanted to move out of the hood as soon as possible. Reading this book convicted me of God's calling in my life to embrace the city as my home--and to love my neighbor as myself.I read this book just in time; shortly after, I was raped in my home while my husband was gone to a meeting at church and my children were asleep in the room next to me. I wouldn't have made it through that trial without having been deeply rooted in the awareness of God's will for me."
1,"It is ok for some things, but many facts are wrong.","Its a great book if the only thing you want to look at is pictures. It's so filled with errors in the stats of items and creatures that no one should use it as a guide. This book she be bought for fun and not bought if you need help with Diablo. The strategies and tips are practically useless. It seems that the makers of ""Diablo: The Official Strategy Guide"" have put very little effort into the book because of the many spelling errors and fact errors."
2,glow in the dark twinkle stars,"I bought this for my daughter. We put them on the ceiling loves to look at them when she goes to bed.The colorful ones don't glow quite as well as other ones, but they work."
2,GREAT COOKBOOK,This is my second Talk About Good Cookbook. The first one I purchased was over 20 years ago and it had worn out....it is a great New Orleans cookbook....
2,Hilarious,"Look at the review title. That's all you need to know. It's a great adult comedy that actually has a decent message. I'd recommend it to anyone who's not easily offended. Even though it's by Seth MacFarlane, it's not over-the-top like Family Guy tends to be."
1,Sacred Stone,"How Cussler could lend his name to this worthless ""novel"" is a mystery to me. No suspense, no character development, disjointed editing, predictable plot add up to an absolute snoozer. I finished it out of incredulity that it could get progressively worse, but it did.I have read everything else Cussler has written, but am now going to be on guard for these "" name cash cows"".Avoid this one."
2,This book is a gift.,This book resonated with me very strongly. It answered so many of my questions about why I act the way I do. It is truly the most useful self-help book I've encountered. Anyone who is honestly looking for healthy ways of looking at life and relationships has found a big chunk of answers.
1,piece of garbage,"I bought mine almost 1 year ago, trying to improve my old (but good) Dell Axim X5, and after using the warranty 4 times, (because the one I bought was overheating when it was Off) first they replaced the battery, then the equipment (twice) and the IPaQs continue overheating, with no technical explanation from HP. Now they offered me an ""Improvement"" to my original choice (the IPaQ 210) but these guys are so smart that sent me only the new IPaQ (210) with no battery, cables, Installation CD, stylus, etc. (the 2795 and the 210 are quite differents in the accessories) this was almost 1 month ago and they are still playing games with me. Conclusion: after 1 year of purchasing the IPaQ I could use it properly around 1 month. My worst experience as Client.... I will go back to DELL."
2,Cabiria --- one of the best cinematic characters EVER!,"Talk about going from bad to worse...just when it seems that life couldn't get any more unfair for Cabiria, Fellini decides to dump a little more misery upon her. Anyone who is indulging in a little self-pity over a lousy job or bratty kids should watch this film to get a sense of perspective.But what makes this character great is that she is either too dumb or too resilient to realize that she has been beaten down by life, and continues to get up off the mat. Despite a relatively small filmography, Giuletta Masina has to be considered one of the premier actresses of her time, and she keeps the character of Cabiria from becoming a cartoonish ""hooker with a heart of gold."" How can a movie be this depressing but simultaneously uplifting? Simply amazing."
2,Great Quality at Bargin Price for the Big 4,"Beautifully recorded by DGG. Beautifully supported by the LSO. Beautifully interpreted by Vasary, especially in his lyrical treatment of the wrongly neglected First.If you're new to the ""outer"" concertos (1 and 4), Vasary's are the place to start.If you have other versions in your collection, Vasary's tempi and keyboard command make this a fine addition. It's my fourth set -- along with Rachmaninoff, Ashkenazy, and Horowitz.Yes, it's ADD. But, the DGG sound is better than many DDDs in my classical collection."
1,Not that great!,I bought this thinking I finally found the scraper that would actually do a good job.....dissappointed with the results! Does not work any better than the cheaper scraper that you can purchase from WalMart.
2,I am already writing,"I originally purchased Syd Field's book years ago and found that book boring and unhelpful. I am a begining script writer and I went to college for finance not writing so I wanted something that would help to get me going. I don't know if I would recommend this book for begining writers because it seems to treat the reader as if they already know something. But this book did have some good ideas that I incorporated.Bottom line is it wouldn't hurt to have this in your collection, if you can only get one book on script writing, I would compare this book with Keane's book at your local bookstore, that one seemed to get a lot of positive reviews. I haven't read it, but the reviews are prompting me to buy that to supplement my education.On a final note, I purchased Movie Magic 2000 software and that was a big help on formating."
2,Great epic fantasy,"This is a wonderful beginning for the ""Halfblood Chronicles"". The characters in this book are great, the world is very original and the style is realy cool.Highly reccomended."
1,"Poor design, poor support","The sizing for this belt is pretty ridiculous, there are only three options to adjust it, so you just have to hope that one of those options will fit, but being pregnant your belly is constantly growing so this is very limiting. Also, the support is very light, I am on my feet a lot at work and needed much more support than this belt offers and I am only 23 weeks."
1,Unhappy with software,We have a version of this scanner from last year. Even with a new software download the print function is very unsatisfactory.
1,"disillusioned already, even before reading book.","I gave this one star even though I haven't read it yet. In fact, I probably will read it eventually. But I lost trust instantly. All it took was reading the title and the book description. I received a postcard from Ms Gittleman plugging this book. How wonderful, a one-day diet! And I will lose 8 pounds! Well, I went immediately to amazon to look up the Fast Track One-Day Diet! Here's the problem - Turns out this is not a one-day diet, it's an 11-day diet. How can I trust this book after this misleading hype? I have a bookshelf full of diet books that promise to be the last diet I will ever need, including just about every book Ms Gittleman has written. The ugly truth is that in order to lose weight we have to change our eating habits and we have to exercise. No one-day miracles."
2,The border legion,Great read. My first Zane Gray read and l can't wait to read the riders of the purple sage. Can't wait to read more.
1,Over My Head,"I have read several dozen books on the subject of Cosmology and related topics. This is a technically oriented book filled with intricate mathematical formulas and is clearly geared for advanced students. I am not shy about mathematics or formulas as a rule and have handled other books on Quantum mechanics, relativity and physics but this book was just over my head."
2,Great For Hacking!,"Ah the Dreamcast may be a distant memory now, but it's legacy will live on forever. That is why I chose to buy a Dreamcast (better late than never) and chose this controller to hack for my Arcade control buttons I bought from Happcontrols.com.Rather than only having just 4 digital buttons and two analog, this controller comes with two additional reprogrammable buttons to map out those two analog buttons. What a treat it is to us curious minds, who are trying to relive the arcade spirit of the 90's.The good: Digital buttons for easy hacking into a TRUE 6-button layout. (ever heard the saying, it's the inside that counts?)The bad: If you're actually using it to play games, this isn't the way to go. It's big and fat, not to mention ugly looking.Bottomline: Ask not what it can do for you, but what you can do with it!"
2,Real good,"My kids love the avatar series and we also have the book one, we are just waiting to have the book 3 too."
2,Easily one of the top 5 Classical CD's of All Time,"This CD is arguably one of the best classical recordings ever, period. One single piano playing Bach's Goldberg Variations. The other reviewer hit it right on the head when he said it does not get any better than this. I cannot do this recording justice with words, so simply purchase it immediately."
1,Terrible Vocals,"Before you read this review, let me tell you I am a huge fan of the NEW ALOL(Hunter). I had this album before Hunter was released and absolutely hate this album. The vocals are terrible compared to the vocals on hunter. If you have ever played Doom3, and you listen to this album, you may notice that the singer sounds exactly like the Revenants. In my opinion, thats really annoying, and listening to this album gives me a headache. Even if you try to follow along by reading the lyrics, trust me, you will get lost.The only reason i give this album any stars is because i love the guitar riff in the first song ""Joan said Please"", and because i like the bands name...So, take my advice, Pass up this album and just buy Hunter."
1,too expensive for what you get.,"This product provides just 10 feet of track and a car for $30 dollars. It should cost $5. Do not buy, as it is simply too expensive. $30 should get at least 100 feet of track."
2,Great alternative to all the Santa movies,We enjoyed this movie as an alternative to all the santa movies out there. My kid found it relatable and fun!
1,IMUS. AMERICA'S COWBOY,"This is a very poorly written book. The author comes across as being too smart by half. For instance she writes of a radio station XELO out of Del Rio, Texas that had an early influence on Imus. She goes on to explain that the station got around FCC transmitter power limitations by locating the transmitter in Juarez. If she had checked her geography she would have noted that Juarez is about 400 miles from Del Rio and the transmitter was actually located across the Rio Grande from Del Rio in what was then called Villa Cuna.She goes on to tell of Imus and his friends doing parodies on a con man named Billy Sol Estes, whom she writes was involved in a salad oil scam, when in fact it was chattle mortages on fertilizer tanks.This may seem like nit picking but given these inaccuracies how does one accept the rest of this book, or any of her other books as being factual?She does give some insights into Imus's character and background that are interesting.....if true."
2,Book arrived fast and in great condition!,The best part of my purchase was the speedy delivery of my book and the great condition of the book. I would most certainly do business again.
2,Great time saver,This scoup is a great time saver when making cookies. It's very sturdy and scoups and dishes out cookie batter quickly and easily!
2,pretty cool,"I think the song show me the meaning of being lonely needs a little work.But the rest is cool. It's got to be you,I want it that way,Larger than life and Spanish eyes are way cool.You should buy it if your into pop."
2,Amusing and Sad.,"This book gives one a glimpse into the everyday of life of rural Africa, then and now. It poignantly illustrates the dichotomus existence of an African growing up in two, sometimes drastically, different worlds. The making of a world statesman is revealed."
2,Great Product,Nice solid weight so it feels sturdy and secure over your shoulder and around your neck. Great scent. 5 minutes in the microwave and you are good to go. The plush material on the outside stops your skin from getting scorched like other similar products that are just made out of rubber or neoprene.
1,Disappointed,"I have to say that I am severly disappointed in this CD. I was expecting a lot more out Creager, especially considering the other two records. Gone are the powerful fiddle solos and catchy tunes, and they are replaced with what sounds like elevator music. If I wanted to buy elevator music, I would buy Kenny G not Roger Creager!! Although despite the mostly bad review, there are a few good tracks. There is a track which can best be described as cajun meets country music, that sounds really good, and there is also a quite funny track about a girl from Shreveport to New Orleans."
1,Disappointed in the FURemover,I just received the FURemover and started to work on carpet in my bedroom. I have several cats in the house and thought this might remove cat hair better than my vacuum. As I raked across the carpet the rake would pull cat hair from one spot to another but never picked it up in the rubber bristles. I still had to bend down and pick up each little clump from the carpet. A grooming glove works much better but not practical over a whole room. Seems the bristles should be stiffer. It's not at all what I hoped for.
2,Shes a legend,"One of a kind voice, Beautiful collection of Dolly's best songs. Enjoyed every one of them. The CD was made in Germany."
2,The Rockford Files,"The kind of show they can't make anymore. That rare group like Picket Fences, Hill Street Blues, and Wiseguy. The Rockford Files was special."
1,Soulstar - - Not Quite There Yet!,"I got the feeling when I was listening to this album that he wasn't there musically or lyrically. The majority of this album is just passé and I could take it or leave it. Forthenight is the only song on here that gets major play in my cd player, and he couldn't even give you five minutes to really get into it. The other songs sound as if he was going off into left field. Now only if he could JustgivemeawholealbumIcouldlistentoo!"
1,Very poor quality,"The product does work as described, but the the durability is pathetic. It's just made cardboard and plastic film. Wont last a day with my kid. Returning."
1,I have a better suggestion,"""Wild Style"" is for the die-hard fans of either 'early hip-hop' or 'old school graffiti.' As a film, the plot plods along, the editing is inconsistent, and the acting is far from engaging.Granted, we see the original artists at work (Lee, Lady Pink, etc.) but it might have had a smoother feel if the cast were made up of (at the very least) collegiate actors. Considering ""Lee"" is portraying not himself, but a character named ""Zorro,"" why not use actors who could deliver a better performance?I enjoyed the video overall (only because I was there in NYC and had met Lee in the late 70's) but if you're interested in a quality production on the origins of NYC rap and what graffiti bombing (back in the day) were really like, then I suggest you hunt down a copy of the '82 ""Style Wars."" Amazon would be doing a great service to the graffiti world if they marketed that video instead of this inept production."
1,Will break under moderate use,"I was so excited when I received this brace! It fits well, goes on and off easily, and doesn't chafe my hand.The first time I picked up a moderately heavy (15 pounds) box, though, the thin strap that goes in front of my thumb broke, rendering the brace useless.It seems that this design flaw could be easily fixed by using stronger material for this strap. Until then, I'd rate this as ""unacceptable: design flaw."""
1,False sale price!!!!,The original price is listed as $109.79 and the sale price is listed as .75 cents. The savings is listed as 99% off. Therefore I assumed I would be getting the 200 pack. I received one Incect Repellent Towelette. Who in their right mind would pay $109.79 for one Insect Repellent Towelette? I'm upset that I paid .75 cents plus $2.75 shipping for one Insect Repellent Towlette. This is false advertisement.
1,Very Disappointed,"Well, in the beginning it must have been ""dumb luck"", because, after a few successful hemming tries, I recently tried simple repair to seams, straight stitching, and the bobbin is jamming up the works. I cannot seem to adjust the bobbin tension to the slight change in fabric and the insturctions are no help. After hours and hours of trial and error, I have given up. My 30 year old singer sewed rings around this one for ease of use. I caution you, prepare to spend a lot of time learning how to adjust this machine's numerous dials from one project to another. -- And the instructions and video are no help for simple sewing --"
1,WHO MADE HIM BOSS!!!,"Sometime around 1979, Bruce lost his edge. He never has since regained it for almost 25 years now. Although he was never gifted with a good voice he made do with a working class theme that seemed believable and genuine.All we seem to get from him after that period were sloppy and repetetitive lyrics, simple songs with catch phrases and an overwhelming urge to bilk the puplic with gimmicks. Many of his songs now, seem to be about a victim or group of victims he wants us to believe he cares about. But in reality (if you pay attention) he seems to care more about his wallet then anything else. The ""Rising"" was an example of this in it's most sickening form.I would reccomend that from the album ""The River"" and on, you should stay away from his work. More then two thirds of this collection are from that period."
1,"Not ""tuffy""nough","I'll get straight to the point. My 1 yr old Goldendoodle had the stuffing ripped out in about 2 hours. We initially had some great tug of war and fetch going on and she really loved it. She lost interest (as a puppy will) and I left the toy on the floor. I came back about a half-hour later to discover she'd chewed through the middle and had ripped out all the stuffing.People may have different experiences as she is a bit of a destroyer. She even managed to destroy one of the KONG. Dental Dog toys and one of the KONG Frisbees.If anyone else has similar destroyers I can only recommend the original KONG. 10 months of continues play, including cage time, it only shows a couple teeth mark here and there."
1,Terrible customer service,"And apparently the only thing I can do is return items. But it is ridiculous that a company's errors are on me to remedy. I'm on vacation and in a small place. Returning giant chairs isn't easy and I was really excited about new chairs!I ordered 2 of these chairs. Received 2 chairs and each is a different color AND both colors not the one pictured and described.That said. The chair quality seems good, but design is a bit odd. The part you sit on is very long and is not comfortable for any one without long thighs- unless you are slouched down.For all above reasons, I suggest trying out in person, not buying online."
1,Disappointing at best,"The book was a major disappointment. I am glad that I did not purchase it for my class, but instead borrowed it. The ordering of topics and emphasis choices never seemed to make sense to me. The layout throughout most of the text is like one long, run-on sentence. The underlying structure of numerical analysis never developed and I was left swimming in meaningless details while the basics were short-changed by an over abundance of specialized algorithms. Perhaps the text's curriculum could be saved by a capable professor, but alas my professor was just as scatter-brained as the text. More pictures would also have been helpful. A replacement text I recommend, which covers the first, matrix theory portion of this book, is David S. Watkins' Fundamentals of Matrix Computations."
1,CLOGS CLOGS AND MORE CLOGS!!!,You have to use a vacuum cleaner to clean the clogs out of the hose. And you think you got the clog.. but ohhhh no.. there is more up there!!
2,Rada is our favorite,"My wife and I love Rada products. We have lots of their knives, and this peeler is the newest item with which our kitchen has been graced.If you want to put yours in the dishwasher, make sure you get the black dishwasher-safe version. The silver one won't last if not hand-washed, but it's very easy to clean by hand.I see that another reviewer with large hands likes the fit of this peeler. I have rather small hands, and still love how this peeler fits in my hand. The handle is comfortable, and manages to feel substantial and strong without being heavy or cumbersome. The blade has stayed very sharp over about a year of use (and it came much sharper than other peelers I've owned). The peeler seems to glide over vegetables, which makes peeling potatoes or carrots much less frustrating than I found it previously."
2,Sullivan tells it like it is.,"Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Ms. Sullivan's book is the accuracy with which she portrays the participants in her anecdotes. As I covered Bradley's campaign for Reuters, I came in contact with many of the players, and upon reading the book was struck by the generosity and penetration that were displayed in turns. Without overtly caricaturing her subjects, Ms. Sullivan has managed to emphasize many of the quirks that typify people on the campaign trail."
2,A Bewitched: Halloween,"The Witches Are Out ____________________When Darrin is asked to design a trademark for his company's client with a witch on it to sell candy, Samantha, Aunt Clara and her bewitching friends try to get him to use a beautiful witch instead of and ugle witch with warts on it. His client turn's the concept do untill Samantha gives the candy executive a new perspective of life on the other side of the broom. _____________________Trick or TreatWhen Darrin insists that Samantha insists that Samantha forgo a Halloween witches celebration in favor of intertaining Darrins clints for dinner, Endora sees red. She hexes Darrin with a spell that will gladually turn him into a werewolf, setting the stage for a howling good time as darrin and Samantha try to hide his new beastly personality from their guest."
1,strangely disappointing,"Perhaps I shouldn't have expected much from such an inexpensive item, but right off the bat it seemed off-kilter somehow: the screw tended to go at an angle into the cork, making it hard to withdraw and more likely to break. I haven't had extensive experience with corkscrews; still, this one seems unnecessarily, even dangerously, sharp to me. There's a little round collar on the top that's supposed to keep the screw from wiggling around and it pops out of its socket a lot. The idea's a good one - the easy-to-grip parts and the size and so forth - but it doesn't seem to work well in practice. I've been struggling along with this for almost a year, but I think I'll try one of the wine waiter corkscrews now."
2,Excellent Camera,The images from this camera are very impressive. I compared this with many other cameras on the web and in the store. None compared in quality.
2,You may like this too,I am a huge fan of Michael Nesmith's solo music and his music with The Monkees. If you enjoy his country-rock style then I strongly recommend that you check out the following:1) March 16-20 by Uncle Tupelo2) Papa Nez: A Loose Salute To The Work Of Michael Nesmith by Various Artists3) Stranger's Almanac by Whiskeytown4) Trace by Son Volt
1,Poor,"Product was marketed as new, but arrived with no packaging and a scratch across the back of the DVD. Very disappointed."
1,BORING FOR BOY AND GIRL,"I BOUGHT THIS VIDEO TO WATCH WITH MY BOYFRIEND. LET ME SUMMARIZE OUR RESPONSES: WE WATCHED, WE YAWNED AND WE WENT TO BED, NOT SHALL WE SAY 'ENERGIZED' LIKE THE INFAMOUS BUNNY. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY FOR A SUPPOSEDLY EROTIC VIDEO. AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR PLAYBOY."
2,Be prepared!,"Amy goes through each combo several times so you really get a chance to get the hang of it. I just fudge it until I get the moves down which is a source of much entertainment for my husband who loves to watch me fumble around! It isn't so hard it's impossible, but you definitely have to be an experienced stepper and in excellent shape to do this workout."
2,Homepathy 101,"A very complete book written at a time when antibiotics were not the norm. I appreciate the candor, the openness and frankness the author uses -- also some of the language is amusing. I appreciate what this female Dr. had to go through during a time in history that was very tough, and all the case histories she gathered to make this book outstanding. Much insite gained. Good reference."
1,Disappointed,"I received this DVD as a Christmas gift and was very disappointed. There was very little of Dean, a not at all funny, and very lengthy Jonathan Winters skit, and the cover was misleading -- not all celebrities listed appeared in the DVD. All in all, a real letdown."
1,Don't believe the hype. There is nothing extraordinary here.,There is nothing extraordinary nor remarkable here. This album's got a lot of merchandising as different or cool. There is nothing ground breaking not special. Just a so-so like everybody else music. This album has got undeserved hype. And what's with those long song titles? How good can it be if the music is just plain and simple. What a dissapointment.
1,BAD,"The glossy covers have started gatting small white spots all over the pictures, and I have only used it for no more than 6 Month. BAD QUALITY, don't buy!!!"
2,Fascinating,"I would have to recommend this movie to people who enjoy atypical yet thought-provoking movies. It is different and not for people not willing to think outside the box. This is a movie about friendship, love, loss, sadness, and the general simplicities in life that are usually over looked. This movie was definitely sad and also made me happy. I enjoyed the many meaningful messages presented throughout the movie. There are many great quotes and provides a different view of how life can be perceived and how life is changing. At most, I would say this movie provides a wonderful message about friendship. A genuine friendship that is rare today. You can do many fancy things to prove you are ""best friends,"" but does your friendship provide you a sense of hope and inspiration? ""You are my best friend. You are my only friend."" One person can make a difference in a persons life, as Mary and Max had did for one another."
2,Pleased as Punch,Thank you for this lovely CD. It came sooner than expected and the quality is as it was listed. I really like this new artist.Lynn
1,One of the few books that I could not finish . . . .,"When I purchase a book I usually finish reading it -- I feel compelled to -- but I just couldn't make it past the first chapter. This book is not very well written and, as someone already stated, the grammar and punctuation is a bit strange and distracting. I ended up putting the book in my ""destination Goodwill"" box so maybe someone else can read it and have a better experience."
1,will? you? will? you will throw out bright eyes,"save your money. take your girlfriend out to dinner. kill what you loathe with a bottle of jack. love, learn, and listen to better music."
2,Coffee table book for New Hampshire fans,This book is basically a photographic journal of the White Mountains. Many photos are old historical sepias and the author compares them alongside modern day photos of the same locations. The book is also a written history of the White Mountains.
2,Hilarious,"Not sure if the moms-to-be or the dads-to-be we're funnier! Enjoyed by both men and women, much more than a chick flick!"
2,Documentary,While I am not the UFO nut in the house my wife seemed to think this was interesting. Its a detailed documentary. A little long for me but she enjoyed it. (several seperate viewings)
1,Pretty language but couldn't stay awake,"This novel is comprised of pretty, well constructed sentences. That's about all it is. Pretty, well constructed sentences. The story itself could be interesting, after all it is a tale of multi-generational abandonment but it is told so dispassionately that it was difficult to remain interested, let alone awake. The narrator, although the main character, was so far removed, emotionally, from her own telling of the story, that you wondered why she had bothered.At time it seems that the writer was so enthralled with her own use of language that she seemed to forget that there was a story that needed to be told."
2,The Sinus Bone Graft,"This book is one of the ""go to books"" for implant dentist. The chapters are written by many leaders in the field in a clear and concise fashion. The knowledge I have obtained has helped me successfully treat many happy patients. This is a must have for the library of every serious oral implantologist. E. Richard Hughes, DDS, FAAID, FAAIP, DABOI"
1,False information,"So i purchased this an ibook from this seller and was excited, because it was suppose to be a gift for my fiance. However, when the item did arrived, my fiance took a good look at it and tried to go on the web. The sad thing is it took forever juswt for the web page to load. AFter that, he tried youtube and youtube cannot even load. He tried transferring all his items from his old laptop to this one (the ibook), however it would not read. So he did some research and turns out that this ibook ran at a 133 MHz. He tried downloading the latest version but found out that the ibook could not handle it because it ran way too slow. I remembered that the description said 800MHz too. So we returned the item due to failure and false advertisement. sad..."
1,Tears...Tears from Boredom,"First let me say how much I wanted to love this movie. I guess it was last Summer when I heard about it and was anxiously waiting the DVDrelease, pre-ordering it from Amazon. So, while my husband was away for the weekend visiting yet another baseball stadium, I couldn't wait tospend time with me, myself and ""Bella"". It started off with promise, but progessively moved into torture mode, boring me to tears - almost.Of course, like any bad film there is a moment or two that are bright spots, the acting is OK although but I think this movie suffersfrom bad editing. At the end, I was left with ""So What?"" Sure, every dayone's life can change forever, but this movie did not bring that message home in a profound way. I just didn't care and felt I wasted my time."
1,Really Bad,"This is one of the worst books I have read in a long, long time. The plot is full of tired cliches and all of the characters, heroes as well as villains, are one dimensional and annoying. Who wants to read more tripe involving Y2K terrorism?"
2,Valentine's Day,This is such a cute movie and has so many amazing actors and actresses in it! I like how they're all connected in some way. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
1,How did this disaster make it to the marketplace?,"Does Universal have NO quality control? I had the same problems as 8 out of 10 reviewers, with the video freezing up due to the extreme compression used to cram too much video into too little digital space. Yes, I have a new DVD/DVR that plays anything... except these defective discs. If Jack Webb were alive he'd sue Universal but good!"
2,Authentic slice of Cajun life with a great story,"This film made you care about the characters it portrayed and made the world they live in come to life on screen. No histrionics, nothing over the top, just good solid story telling. Very enjoyable."
1,Don't waste your time...or money.,"Before I purchased this straightener I researched it. I read the reviews for this and other ones and since I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a Chi I thought this seemed like a good deal. Boy was I wrong. I was so excited to try it out when I got home that I heated it up and started in on my damp hair. My hair looks matted where I straightened it. My curly hair is still wavy in places that I went over 5 or 6 times. The ends look coarse and not smooth even though I curled them under like I usually do. I tried everything, turning up the heat, taking bigger sections, taking smaller sections. Nothing will work! If the sections are small than this straightener pulls your hair and actually catches in your hair as you run it through. I am so disappointed that it's going back tomorrow! Don't waste your time or your money if you have curly hair."
2,7 months ago...,"I started using the Brita Disposable Faucet Filtration System on 17 October 2007... and today (16 May 2008) the light just turned red. That's seven months, which equates to about 210 gallons of filtered water, which BTW, I actually measured. I was hoping this filter would last a year, but can't complain about 7 months since I paid under $25. If they could have maintained that cost, I would have considered buying another... but several weeks ago I was checking on prices and discovered this specific filter had skyrocketed to almost $70... along with rumors that it had been discontinued. I was forced to find a cheaper alternative... which I'm not revealing out of fear that product's price will also skyrocket. Good luck in your search for safe clean water."
2,the best book about the subject,"A great book, lots of example and views about adult human.i used it for 3d work."
2,Perfect Power,This is a e book of a book I love. I have it on my cell phone which I always havewith me so I can tap into the Power of Now anytime. This is important to me because I can never get too much of Now.This is a great book for anyone that wants to get in touch with the present moment.I need.constantreminders to get out of my head
2,Great Story,Jane Austen is my favorite author. I love her work! She is a priceless gem of our great authors. All she wrote was wonderful.
1,A Major Disappointment,"Poor recording, wimpy performances, bizarre editing and goofy graphics at the the beginning of each song made this DVD a real bust. I should have taken to heart a similarly dismal review by another purchaser before I bought this disc. I'm sorry to have to say this about one of my favorite groups of all time, but, they should be embarrased for letting this disc be released."
2,"Excellent product, great price!","Excellent product, great price here at Amazon.com! Highly recommended. Price about the same as knock offs, and the quality of OEM seems to be better."
2,G100-1BV. Casio watch,"Es un buen reloj, la relacion precio vrs funcionalidad es buena! El producto cumple las expectativas ofrecidas por el fabricante."
1,these are double dobby stripes,nowhere in the description does it say that these sheets are dobby striped. i was looking for solid white sheets. another disappointment!
1,"Great for 3 months, then stopped working","The Magic Bullet worked great for 3 months. I used it frequently to make fruit smoothies. I was very careful never to run the motor for more than 1 minute at a time, in accordance with the instructions. One day I was blending a smoothie and it worked for about 10 seconds, then it just stopped and has not worked since. This was about 3 months after I purchased it. A waste of money; I bought the ""set"" so now I have a set of cups with lids for it, but no base motor. I would agree with others who say buy a better machine."
1,BAD PROGRAMMING,"I was a huge fan of Dragnet in the 1970's and 1980's watching the reruns. At first I wa impressed with this collection, but the dvds froze up on some of the episodes. I contacted amazon and they sent me a brand new copy. I had the same problem on that one as well. This seems to be a common problem on the Television collections. I had the same problem with the Miami Vice collection. I wish the people who are responsible for putting these dvd collections together would do it the right way. I sent the copies back and until amazon can assure me that they have copies that are not effective I will have to do without. I wonder if anyone else is having the same problems."
2,really cute,"Loved as a shower gift, with ""Super Mom"" shirt also. Very hip mom was thrilled, shipping good, quality too"
1,Not so good,"The taste of the water was good but I had problems with the light indicator. The first filter's light was red from the moment of installation. Amazon sent a replacement right away. I installed the second and the light was green at first but went to red within a few hours. The filter was probably good to use, just the indicator is malfunctioning. However, the indicator is important. Without it, how would I know when it is really time to replace the filter?The drinking fountain is a good idea but when using it the water would continue to flow heavily from the filter's spout, wasting a LOT of water. I'm sending both back and forgetting about this model until Brita does a better job of diverting water from the filter's spout to the fountain, and has a better indicator system."
2,?,"Thankfully, we live in a society where literature isn't entirely censored to that degree. If you like that sort of view--try Fahrenheit 451. But then again, we live in a world where chivalry is considered chauvinism, so I'm not surprised by some of these negative replies.Frankly, I enjoy the bodice rippers. I don't apply modern-day feminism to historical literature, but I could understand if the timeline were a bit more modern. Nevertheless, I'm almost certain that writers aren't going to alter their writing style, to ascribe to few who took too many bitter women's studies."
2,sony cassette player,I was looking for a sturdy cassette player without spending too much. I certainly found it. It has great sound and can be dropped on the floor without breaking! I am very satisfied.
1,I was severely disappointed,"This is my first experience in shopping for Reggae. I've heard Reggae around and fell in love with it, problem is I've only heard Jamaican reggae (True reggae in my opinion). This CD is the most boring, placid and unexciting thing I think I've ever heard and I wish so much I never wasted the money. For those out there searching for reggae be very sure to be far more selective and careful than I since reggae comes in so many forms and if you don't find the one right for you you're going to be running for cover from a form not suited for you (Sheesh I am running too.)To sum up this CD ,from my own personal perspective, I'd say first the accoustics are low key, the music is sung like a mexican salsa, and the lyrics seem to be drudged up from a person with little imagination."
2,"Sure, it's ""young King"", but that's better than most authors","Sure, the writing in this book is ""young King"", but that's better than most authors even at the peak of their talents. All the raw skills that would make Stephen King the bestselling horror author ever are here, and this is a fast and enjoyable read. Even if you've seen the movie, you owe it to yourself to read the novel. You won't regret it."
2,BLIND FURY,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE WHICH SHOWS HOW AN INDIVIDUAL MAY OVERCOME A PHYSICAL HANDICAP TO EXCEL IN A MANNER MAKING HIS QUITE LETHAL TO THOSE WHO WOULD/COULD CAUSE HARM TO OTHERS. R. HAUER IS QUITE BELIEVABLE IN HIS ROLE AS NICK AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR THOSE WHO, LIKE MYSELF, WORK AS A THERAPIST FOR MENTALLY CHALLENGED ADULTS. THEY ENJOYED IT AS WELL AS OUR DISCUSSION. THANK YOU. BYB"
1,The Best of 50 Guitars,"The Best of the 50 GuitarsI loved the vinyl recordings of the 50 Guitars. Alas, I got rid of themyears ago. I was happy to see a cd version had been released.I purchased a copy and was extremly disapointed with the quality (or lack there of.)As the recorning studio that remastered these songs is located in No Hollywood, which is near where I live, I went there to discuss thedisc. I couldn't get by the front desk. I was informed that I would have to contact the seller. I purchased a second copy from another seller in the hopes that they wouldn't all be bad. Yeah,right!This is absolutily the worst remastering I have ever heard. I worked over 20 years in major Hollwood studios sound departments,and have never heard anything like this cd.Save your money."
1,Don't Buy It- It's Junk!,"Don't buy this coffee maker it's junk.I bought mine about three months ago and it blew up tonight,it had been making crackling noises for a couple of days and finally sparked and blew a breaker.A bunn costs more but will last for years.I gave my daughter my bunn coffee pot,I'd used it for five years now I wish I'd have kept it.Don't waste your money on the presto coffeemaker."
1,and the wind cry's....,so loudly you can barely hear jimmy speak. this video was ok if you got it to watch hippies instead of hendrix. The footage is terrible and the sound quality is constantly overmatched by the wind blowing in the mike. Sorry but this ones no good
2,An Informative Book,"The name says alot about the book. I like it quite a bit because it does have answers to questions which any new supervisor would be wondering about. It's simple, and easy to understand."
1,told the story - but - not like the newer movies that have come,"This movie tells the story - but after seeing the first two Disney versions of the other stories, this is lack-luster. I can't wait for the release (though not Disney this time) of the same title this Christmas 2010."
1,Broke after a few uses,After being used about ten times it sat in the cabinet for a few months and started leaking blue liquid. When I contacted Kitchenaid they said it was past the warranty for that defect and wouldn't refund my money. For $70 it should have lasted much longer. And there should be no time limit on defective products.
2,Better than I expected,"Maybe it's just me, but I haven't had to purchase a Storyteller's screen in a long while, and this met and exceeded my expectations. Was expecting a thin cardboard foldable that would hide my secrets. What I got was four segments of the same material that's used on the book itself. This material feels thick and sturdy, and will last as long as you need it to.Haven't been able to test the usefullness of the content inside, still convincing my gamers to make the move from V:tM to V:tR, but it looks like the standards I'd be looking up.The only thing preventing this from getting a 5 is the outer artwork, the screen is the deep red you'd expect from the book, and features the same glossy rose petals you'd see on mentioned book. There are however small, I want to say 4 in x 2 in, pictures along the bottom that distract from the subtleness of the screen.A screen well worth the purchase, and one you'll be sure to use for a long time to come."
2,100 Hikes in Oregon's Central Cascades,"Since I have spent the better part of my life hiking in the Central Cascades of Oregon, I thought I would buy the book to expand my knowledge of the area and to also review some of my many treks. The book is well organized and provides many details for each hike that includes accurate directions to each destination. Well worth the investment."
1,range is terrible,"This is the poorest range phone I have ever purchased.I do not have a large house and the base has to be located in the center of the house to get reception inside the house. If the base is just 13 feet from the end of the house, it will not work in the bedroom just 24 feet away. It will not work outside at all. My older phone would get reception up to 150+ feet out in the yard.I emailed customer service and got no customer service and no recommendations."
1,So many XP Problems!,"If you want to learn everthing there is to know about XP then this product is the one for you. I had so many problems and with no customer support, that I truly became an expert in how to remove software from my computer. Finally I tried NTI's CD MAKER 2000 and NERO. Both products actually worked with no problems, unlike ROXIO. I went with NTI CD MAKER 2000, just liked to user interface, price and customer service a bit better than NERO, but I really like things simple."
2,Great Automatic for the Price,I wanted a high end looking watch but being 25 years old and more important things to spend my money on than a $2200 Tag time piece (what I really wanted). This watch cost me under $90 and it is a full automatic. An automatic watch is great yet you need to also purchase a winder. I wake up every morning to a dead watch right now. A winder can cost from $40 to $500. So add that into the cost of the watch. The half priced 8932 with batteries might be worth it if your on the fence. But it's still cool to show your friends a watch that looks just like a Rolex Submariner and is also an automatic.
1,DISSAPOINTED,"I just bought this DVD and i was surprise i expected people dancing the whole hour with me, i hate to work out alone, i enrolled the gym and they have Zumba in their schedule but only 1 intructor is good and she only does zumba once a week, which is not enough for me, other instructors dont make me sweat at all, and i get so bored, i expected that this DVD will help me on my routines but definately i get even more bored exercising watching a video with just music on it, i have a lot of song by myself i just needed to play mi cd and dance but that's exactly i didnt want to do, again i'm so dissapointed"
2,Super great,"Slim, well fitting. everything it's supposed to be. Pretty much the perfect workout accessory."
2,Perfect Stocking Stuffer!,"This is a really cute book with wonderful photographs of dogs enjoying the holiday season. The book is hardcover with very nicely designed graphics and is sized perfectly for the Christmas stocking. I will need twelve copies of ""Twelve Days"" for all of my dog-owning friends!"
2,Insightful,"This is a profound book that every leader should read. The author has deep insight into the human heart, relational health, and social trends. I enjoyed how he supported his insights from the world of science, and how he provided valid critiques to pop psychology. The call to take personal responsibility for our choices is welcomed, but as profound as his argument is, we are not given much help to do so. In the end, I am enlightened and impressed, but I would appreciate a more empowering conclusion."
1,If you wand a hot head.......,"The solar panel does not work. It takes me 3 hours to mow my lawn. In northern Illinois we had a very hot and sunny summer. The fan did not ever work under solar power. If I had had the time,I would have returned this product. Lord knows that I am so sick and tired of buying %^*#@ crap."
1,Thank goodness it finally broke!,"After about 2 years of unevenly burned toast this thing died. For the last year the only way to get the toast up was by unplugging the toaster. Since the eject and the ""doneness"" share the same dial, you can't set the toaster to the perfect doneness and leave it at that setting...you have to continually fiddle with it. I would rate this as 1 star, however, I believe that my passionate hatred of this toaster may be clouding my judgement, so therefore I give it 2 stars."
2,Exactly what we needed!,We had to find a new wireless remote keypad when our garage door opener quit working. This remote keypad fit perfectly where the old one was installed. Installation and programming was easy. No problems. Very happy with purchase.
1,do not buy,I returned this product. It is not at all what you expect. It is made very cheaply for the cost.
2,Solid product but needs fine finishing of details,"Product delivered as promised and materials are first-rate, but for some reason the mold tabs from manufacturing were not filed or shaved down even with the other surfaces, leaving small places for dirt to collect and possibly snagging cleaning cloths, etc. The fact that there are no screws holding the seat to the hinges to corrode is a real positive - everything is plastic."
2,Radio Flyer Wager Umbrella - Must Have!,"This umbrella is a must have if you own any of the Radio Flyer wagons. It is a great accessory...specially for those hot, sunny days. I took my daughter to the local zoo and people came up to me all day asking where I purchased the umbrealla. The umbrella provides just the right amount of protection for your child without getting in the way. The only warning I have for this product is be careful using the adjustable spring. The spring allows you to tilt the umbrella for covering your child. The spring is very stiff. I accidentally bent the metal pole above the spring. When adjusting the angle of the umbrella, hold the spring only while bending. Overall, this product is great!"
2,Kick ass country/blues CD despite low down dirty trixxx,"Not even the low down dirty tricks of sleazy suit and tie types at Catfish UK could move me to penalize this fine, fine collection of old country and blues standards. The dirty tricks I'm refering to are the plastering of Johnny Cash's name across the cover as well as the design elements employed in order to sucker the buyer into believing they're purchasing one of the newfangled, remastered, Lost Highway discs.Despite these nefarious techniques this CD is astonishing. The Carter Family and Leadbelly are prominently featured and you get a heapin' helpin' of old country and blues standards that Johnny himself oftentimes covered (""Orange Blossom Special"", ""Born To Lose"", ""Dark as a Dungeon"" and ""Nine Pound Hammer"", for exmaple).All in all this is a sweet collection of some of the best country artists around."
2,Better than the real thing,This comforter is an alternative that is better than the real thing. For the price you can't beat this one. I was a skeptic but it is great!
1,Already had to repair these,"Work pants for the husband. Because he works around welders, I purchase the bib style pants for him to keep him from burns. They really help! But first thing to happen with this pair was the front zipper jammed due to the way they are made. I had to take apart the front to get the zipper to go down. Then restitch them back together. The zipper pull can go all the way up past the end of the zipper and gets jammed at the top. Then you have to completely undress each time you need a moment, instead of just using the zipper. I had to completely remove the zipper - move it up - and then rebuild the pants. Really? These are Carhartt! Normally a real good brand but not this pair!"
2,Coupon Queen,I ordered this as a free book and was surprised that it was a good read. The storyline kept me interested and the ending was good.
1,LOVE THIS TIME ON THE CEILING /TEMP CLOCK,"the clock light is not obtrusive, i donot need glasses to see what time it is all during the night........... i enjoy this little jewel."
2,A Nine Year Old Thinks,"This is round book. It starts at the begining and comes back to the begining at the end.The illustrations are bright and funny. You`ll want to put away the mousetrap and leave out a cookie,oh yeah and milk."
2,Odd little film is wonderful,"Static stars Keith Gordon (Christine, Dressed to Kill) as a strange young man that works in a crucifix factory (yes, really) and takes home the ones that don't quite meet quality standards..in fact he has a rather large collection. When he's caught taking one he's fired, but he's good with that, that gives him plenty more time to work on his invention, which is a machine that shows Heaven. The problem is, except for him, no one can see anything on the monitor of this machine except: static. Amanda Plummer also stars as a ""new wave"" keyboard player who needs a break from performing so goes home to her desert town (yes, of course, this very same one) and manages to get in on this whole strange little situation. A very strange and quirky little film, definitely off-beat and guaranteed to delight those who enjoy strange little films. A mid-80's delight. 4 out of 5 stars, and I can't wait for the DVD!"
1,Save your money,I had very low standards for this product and it managed to come in well under all of them. Biggest problem is the tuner. You get stations on top of other stations. Save your money and buy a better unit.
2,Buffy Season 5,The DVD's are in good condition and arrived here within a week. I am very pleased with the prompt and quality service.
2,Very handy speaker brackets,"These satellite speaker brackets turned out to very useful when I installed an Energy 5.1 classical home theatre system. They come supplied with plenty of bolts and fixings to cope with many different speaker types. I ordered Polk speaker stands to which the Energy speakers could not be attached, I improvised with the supplied bolts and used the spare speaker brackets to solve my mounting problem. Very neat!"
2,Not a Bad First Album...,"I have to admit, the only reason that I bought this CD was because I had tickets to see A Perfect Circle, and this band was the opening act. I had never heard of these guys (obviously, they are a new band), and so, I wanted to hear what I would be seeing at the show. And, happily, I like what I heard. If you are a fan of heavy music, then this may not be for you. This is a surprisingly mellow disc, but there are a few heavier tracks. I especially enjoy the song ""Power Struggle,"" which also appears on the ""Hollow Man"" soundtrack, and the first song on the disc, ""I'm Not Trading"" has quickly become a favorite of mine. And after seeing these guys perform live, I like them all the more. They sounded great and put on a good show. Also, they seem to really be very appreciative of the support that they are getting from the Tool/A Perfect Circle fans. I like them a lot, and think that they are a band to watch in the future."
1,Disappointment,"I commend the author on his attempt to display a solution on oversleeping, however I found this material to best suit an article in a magazine rather than book form. The content was not anything that you do not already know, no matter who you are, you have just got to apply the will to want to wake up. What the book boils down to is you must have internal motivation to wake up on time. If you have problems getting up, then the chances are that you do not have anything exciting to wake up to. Save the price of this book and go by a goal setting book instead. Good luck and Godspeed..."
2,More house,"After their first 3 albums, their sound has slowly evolved from the past-popular electronic down tempo to almost full on house. Gorgeous vocals w/ a bit of funk & bossa over a nice slow beat. Still like them - but much different from detunized gravity, et al."
2,A Real Help,"Dr.Toister's short stories were a tremendous help with my children. The book created realistic stressful situations that are difficult for young children and provided empathy and assistance with coping for my children. EXCELLENT !! Hopefully, we will see more from Dr.Toister."
2,Great game,"The game is exactly as I remember from my childhood and my kids love it! The box will get thrown away, so luckily the game has it's own compartment for the pieces so it can all be self-contained. The makers of the game look like they tried to reduce the packaging by making it thinner and weaker. Admirable but not great for kids who are kinda hard on things. We'll just throw the box away and keep the game with the pieces inside the compartment. I love that this game takes no batteries! It entertains my kids for hours!"
1,Consider a different brand,"First, I recommend not buying cookware on-line unless you are familiar with the product. Go to a department or cooking store and judge the quality for yourself.This Revere set is quite light weight (very thin stainless steel) with what appears to be a micro-spray of cooper coating on the bottom. In my mind, this does not qualify it as being ""cooper clad.""The product description is misleading and you'll be disappointed if you order this set based on the official description. You can go to walmart and buy a set of similar quality for half the price.After returning this Revere set to Amazon, we went to a department sore and got a very beautiful, durable set of Emeril Cookware for a bit more money. But the *TRUE* quality is worth it."
2,Very satisfied with this product!,"I bought this watch case as a gift for my boyfriend, and he really liked it! It is very nice looking and high quality, not at all cheap looking like some of the other ones I have seen. Overall I can say that I was very proud to have picked out such a nice gift!"
1,Lies and the Lying Liars that tell Them,"Al Franken is a liar himself. He wouldn't know the truth if it smacked him in his fat head. He is a liberial that hates Bush.As a liberial, he thinks that his ilk is ""entitled"" to controlling the government. He also is an America hater. Guys like this muling, puking dolt should move to France. There he would be at able to agree with the spineless, ungrateful French when they spew their hate America bulls**t!"
1,what's the point...,"What I don't get is, why spend the money on a 13 piece ""bath"" set, when six pieces aren't even bath related... i.e., when was the last time you fed your baby during his/her bath? I have four kids and have never needed bibs or burp cloths during bathtime. Seems to me money could be better spent elsewhere. Also, fabric is not very soft at all, and is very thin."
1,Silly is to nice for this movie,"Please people, how could you give this 4 stars? lol. Who are your dealers? What a dumb movie! I watched 15 minutes of this andI said to myself; Man I must be old. If you are a child or a stoney you will like it. I'm sure the same people that enjoyed this movie also enjoyed Dude Wheres my Car."
1,Disney is disapointing,"I will pass on this one and all the other Disney DVDs until they do it right, not until I get the full aspect ratios of their films on WIDESCREEN will I purchase any."
2,A Very Classy Piece of Work,"Cyndi shows us a vocal ability that's nothing short of phenomenal, with an album that fits her to a ""T."" She expressives herself so well on a range of covers, running the gamut from the Righteous Brothers, to Bacharach, Piaf, The Animals, Nina Simone and Louis Armstrong. The opening title track, is her interpretation of 60's jazz Great Etta James's signature song. Cyndi nails this one, and the other 9 songs she put together and produced w/Russ Titleman. You may recognize his other work - producing for Eric Clapton, among others. Let's face it, Cyndi Lauper has been so unfairly labeled over the last 20 years - much of those years only getting recognized for her 80's work. It is a travesty, because she deserves so much more credit than that. The 80's are long gone. Some of you need to wake up and just give this one a try. You'll be glad you did."
2,Excellent Workout!!!,"I received Paula Abdul's Get Up and Dance Video in the mail just two days ago and I love it already!!! I have to admit that the first day was a little hard. The dance moves were a little tough at first but by the second day I had no problem. The key is to rewind and stick with it. Don't give up! Once the dance moves are learned or atleast done with a bit of ease; the workout is amazing. I didn't think that working out could be so much fun. The workout doesn't seem as challenging as some others that are out on the market (taebo for example) but by the middle of it I could tell that I was really working. I love this video. It makes working out fun, not a chore. I'd recommend this for anyone who doesn't have much time to get to the gym but still wants to get a great workout at home. Just one warning- don't do this on carpet. I never have but I've read a few reviews that warn against attempting to do the moves on a carpet. Other than that- this video is amazing!"
1,Horrible,I am usually a big fan of Woody Harelson. But this movie was a complete waste of time and money. Dont make my mistake of renting this movie.
1,THE SCREEN WILL BREAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"ok the phone is cool and I like doing the slide thing as much as the next guy or gal. BUT this phone's screen will crack. You don't even need to break or mare the actually plastic screen itself becuase basically any dropping of the phone will cause the liquid crystal display to crack inside the phone and then the liquid just oozes out and makes it hard to see many parts of the screen. I thought oh well I'll be careful when I got my phone, surely I won't also break the screen as other people had warned in these reviews, but oh yes I did. I even keep my phone in a case every day and the screen still has 3-4 large cracks in it after only having the phone for less than 6 months. Well hey stop trying to buy this phone just cause it slides and get a flip phone so your screen won't crack, at least thats my advice."
1,People who liked this: check for carbon monoxide leaks,"I got this because it said ""punk rock spinal tap"" on the packaging (attributed to the NY Times). Neither are true. I couldn't enjoy this movie on any level. It wasn't funny, it didn't seem to have any story and the characters (I can't honestly say I really gave it them a whole lot of thought after the worst half hour of my life aka the first half hour of this movie) just seemed like charicatures of people you'd avoid because they were boring and useless. I had no idea this movie was Canadian when I got it but about five minutes into it I had a feeling and started wishing that Joel or Mike, Crow and Tom Servo were in the lower right corner to help me through this disaster. In a word, terrible. I almost felt bad after reading how much people liked this movie in the other reviews posted here, but I have to wonder, am I insane or are these guys friends with the people who made this abomination."
1,To western!,I am a huge shoujo fan and this is deppressing. The art in this book doesn't even LOOK like manga. Even a begginer can figure that out. I mean I showed this book to my friend who doesn't even like manga and she could even figure out that Hart is terrible at manga. Beggieners or advance stay away! Instead of wasteing your money on this dinky little 60 paged book try the how to draw manga series. You might accually LEARN how to draw real manga!
1,horrible quality,Horrible video quality...almost non watchable. Story is fine but the quality of the video leaves alot to be desired. We were barely able to watch it because of the video quality.
2,It could happan to anyone,"Pretty good movie, only saw it once, comical yet informing, no movie of the year, but it wasn't expected to be. It's a prime example on how any rich/political figures can swindle and what goes on with thier familes. Micheal Dougles did a good job, as did Benicio Del Toro...Reccamended movie.."
2,My review for 48 days.,This book came in excellent condition. I have not read this yet. But I was pleased with how quick the book came and how well the condition the book came. I always order my books used.
1,"OH, JOY OF JOYS! THIS IS SUPER! :-D :-D :-D","Hi everybody! Oh boy, what a crazy year I had!

2,THE textbook for ASE certification!,"If you want to obtain ASE certification, you want this book. If autobody work is your hobby, you want this book. Covers auto-body work, from tools to procedures, as any such book should. But it also covers areas that most others don't. Shop layouts, safety equipment and uses, (What fire extenguisher to use on what type of fire.) hand tools and techniques for use, types of sheet metal, air compressors, how to set-up air supply lines, types of welders, and more. From small repairs to painting, and diagnosing paint problems. Each chapter starts with objectives of what you should learn, and is followed by questions (multi choice, essay, math) to test what you learned. Followed by appendices for shop terms & abbreviations, decimal & metric equivalents, fluid and air nozzle selection charts, viscosity conversion charts. If you want to work on cars, professionally or as a hobby, YOU NEED THIS BOOK!!"
1,The New Stuff vs. The Old Stuff,"Well I first bought Transatlanticism and enjoyed it so much that I decided to check out some of the band's other music. I was disappointed to find that their new stuff is much, much better than their old stuff. Though I'm sure their die-hard fans will completely disagree.I suggest buying transatlanticism and moving forward, not backward."
1,Mark of the Cat: Year of the Rat,"product was received in a timely manner, but was the wrong book. they sent me the 1st book in the series when I ordered the 2nd.....the sticker on the book was even wrong. Pretty major mistake as the first book can be purchased for under a dollar and the one I ordered cost $40 something!!! I was able to send it back and got a refund pretty quickly."
2,A little perception,"Too many people have the courage to discuss and argue about Nietzsche ideas, but certainly a few have the ability to understand it within the context and I am writing this specially because a review that present full of pride the notion of existence talking about Nietzsche. Hello world! Nietzsche never talks about the existence of God or denies it, he simply talks about his death, however this acepts it, but that no matters, he reach God by the men and their acts. So the idea is lets talk like the men does, not like Pascal or Descartes wants, but like the humanity is talking. I dont kill God neither Nietzsche did, but what does the others are doing?"
1,Horrible Writers,"This movie had one of my favorite actresses from Twilight in it that made her very dissapointing to me. The writers of this movie gave her no justice of her talents as an actress. One word for this movie ""HORRIBLE"" and not horror. These writers need to be fired and banned from ever working on another movie again, especially on Chiller TV."
2,Money Saver and Easy to Take,I did quite a lot of investigation as to the brand of CoQ0 and found Swanson's to be the best not only in absorbation but it price. Many offers were over $30.00 for the same dosage and count but Swanson had the best price.
1,"Over priced, over hyped, bandaid approach to parenting","I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. It takes less than two minutes to read and suggests that being a good parent means never yelling or to buy your children more things. The children are supposed to range in age from 8-12 years, but the penmanship resembles that of 5 year old children. I have six children ages 3-16 and all of my reading children thought it was ridiculous. Any parent with one ounce of common sense and intelligence already knows these little ""pearls of wisdom"", and parents who have poor parenting skills are not going to be helped by some cutsie book that suggests he/she stop talking on the phone or buy their child more expensive ice cream. If you need helpful tips on parenting your child or pre-teen this book will be useless to you. Your money would be better spent somewhere else, anywhere else"
1,Cloudy,"I was not satisfied with this product because of the quality of the diamonds and the mounting,I have returned them to the seller."
1,What The?,"Why in world call this ultimate?The cartoon series is available seperatlywhile the curse of the pink panther without sellers , The son of the pink panther&and the 2006 sham with steve martian which nobody likedI don't get this ? MGM search for more moneyThe only interesting thing in this set is 60 minutes extra footage, of the pink panther? I guess now that Blake Edwards is dead. MGM candig up purposly lost footage and nobody can object.?I will not buy this set, and have feeling alot people wont either.MGM is double dipping theres nothing wrong with 2004 collectionI know the return of pink panther is not available in eitherset .it goes to show you some companies will milk it,until the cow is long dead."
1,"It's dead, Jim","I have had this scale for about 4 months. It worked fine the few times I used it, but last night I went to use it and it has given up the ghost. I swapped batteries and still nothing. The connection for the 9v battery is VERY loose, and even after crimping and holding it tight it didn't get any juice. Not happy so I will order a different brand and hope it does better. I do not abuse or heavily use my kitchen gadgets, so maybe I just got a lemon."
2,Great,"I love this pillow for plane travel, the only one I ever found that was comfortable , I give them to my traveling friends"
1,bad product/damaged,the case from the cd was broken!! for me trying to do a gift to my sister it did not worked i had to buy another movie from a local retailer...the ompany that sold me the produt didnt do anything to solve my problem. they pretty much say u paid so u keep it... it makes it look like all they want is just say without caring about what the customer says..
2,Amazing Sheets,"I am not a flannel sheet fan, but my wife wanted some so that we she jumped into bed in the fall and winter she wasn't freezing. These sheets are truly amazing! When I get in, I am not cold at all. and they are very soft and thick, but not stiff. The sage color is pretty."
2,Buy this for your kids and watch it yourself!,My wife and I took a chance after a friend saw this at a screenign and told us about it. We love it as much as our kids. Very funny and things for kids and parents (especially dads)! High reccommendation!
2,This is how rock should be.,"Before the music scene took a 180 degree turn in 1992, the rock bands before that time actually had some talent. Great vocalists, blistering guitarists, deafening drummers, and some great melody. TNT was a band that had all of these attributes. This album is a must for any of those who like that talented and exciting music of the 80's which is so lacking today. For the alternative/grunge rockers, stay away! Maybe with the release of Def Leppard's Euphoria album, this style of music will become popular again and TNT will once again give us great music!"
1,Cheap Starter Assembly and Far Distant Repair Shop,"The starter handle and its assembly snapped off after about 20 uses. I should have looked before I purchased, but was surprised to find that the nearest Black and Decker repair facility (according to their web site) was 2 round-trips of 60 miles each. (total of 60 miles to take it, and 60 miles to retrieve it after repairs.)Fortunately, I was able to find an authorized repair shop just 5 miles away, but they were not listed on the B&D; website."
2,Amazing Book!,"This book is fascinating- told from death's perspective, you get a good overview of many characters you might not otherwise have in a novel. And the price was definitely reasonable!"
1,awfully bad!,"There is no suspense, Amanda quick-ly lets us know who the murderer is. Beyond that, the book is padded and padded and padded with extraneous info. I would rate it ""I hate it,"" but the sex scenes are more true-to-life than most."
1,awful,"this thing worked once. ONCE! After that, the motion senor never worked properly again. So then we just figured we'd raise and lower the lid manually. Well, because of the gearing for the auto lift, most of the time the lid jams and won't go back down after you open it.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. Unless you enjoy things that don't work.... it's junk."
1,"Natural cures ""They don't wnat you know to about","I sent the book back, I was very disappointed. I expected suggestions, not to have to look them up on the internet. I believe some of the things he suggested to do to get and stay healthy were unreasonble."
1,Cheap.,This lens is TOO BIG!! Hard to handle. The adapter broke going into my camera. The price is cheap and the parts are cheap. You get what you pay for...
1,No point buying this cd,"The songs feature in this cd can be found in the game cd as well, so there is no point buying this one."
2,** An unexplainably beautiful fantasy **,"This book was simply incredible. What a spectacular job Mercedes and Andre do of creating such emotion into words on a paper. The very thought of that book fills me with swelling anticipation of how good a fantasy really can be. To me it created an entirely new world, something that was so real I can picture it with ease. If you really want to experience a fantasy filled with every kind of emotion, from dizzying romance, to boiling hatred, you have found it."
1,What can i say,David Eddings' books are just the thing for those cold winter evenings. You never know when you might run out of kindling. Some people might suggest you read them but unless you want put to sleep by the most tedious nonsense ever written I would avoid it. i found the plot slow and unoriginal and the characters were practically identical. If you want a proper fantasy story Eddings wasn't too bad in the Elenium although I'd go for Ursula LeGuin myself who is capable of getting to the point in a story instead of making 1 page worth of plot last a chapter.
1,Almost a total waste,"I was not impressed with Beyonce's c.d. I purchased her and Monica's at the same time, and Monica's c.d. gets alot more play in my car. Lyrically, it is a sad c.d. A 5 year old could've written most of the songs. She's a great performer, and the ballads are great, but overall, it's too ""britney spears"" for me. Nice effort Beyonce.....Maybe the follow up will be better."
2,Not a must have but a great tool for a specific use,"I don't use this everyday. It will never rival my spoonula for most indispensable kitchen tool, but it is really good at what it does. It is easy to load, use and clean. It rarely misses the mark, and if you have small kids its a wonderful tool to have. It feels sturdy and comfortable to use and stores easily in a drawer. If you NEED a cherry pitter, then this is the one."
1,Disappointing,"I, too, was disappointed in this book. I expected more information about how healthcare was going to move toward a more proactive approach. I found the book focussed on the author's views about his own products. Was not relevant to Australia - despite the fact that it says it is a book for all countries. A waste of my money!"
2,A Smart Book,"It was a smart and well intended piece. It is only 4 years old but already because the world have changed so much, it is needing to be updated for this new generation and world political climate. Time for a ""2nd Edition"" Mr. Basso, etc????"
2,An Excellent Dictionary for a Student of Persian,"Most English-Persian dictionaries on the market (if not all) are designed to serve the needs of native Persian speakers who are learning English. The English-Persian Dictionary by Dariush Gilani is designed specifically for the English speaker who is learning Persian. Unlike most English-Persian dictionaries, Professor Gilani's book includes a Western alphabet transliteration of Persian words in addition to the Persian alphabet spelling. It is an essential tool for any English speaker who is serious about learning the Persian language."
2,IH Lover,"This is an awesome cd. I have been a fan of Ingram Hill for a very long time. Just listen to the whole cd once through.....on the next time through, you will know the chorus of every song. Evry song gets you singing along....you just cant help it. I would HIGHLY reccommend this awesome cd!"
1,Not For Me,"The product probably works, but a few seconds of use told me that I needed a product more stable. The plasic platter had a warp and the cartrage tracked too heavy for my taste. I decided to return the item and look for another solution, which presented itself with my hooking my old, but very good turntable into my laptop docking statation. Too my surprise I already had a program to capture music from my old turntable and I did not need this product."
2,Also supports the Garmin Nuvi 660,Best price I could find for a genuine Garmin 12v power adapter and works for the Nuvi 660.
1,Internet connection turns off all the time,"After a certain time the modem begins to loose the conection to Internet every now and then, the only solution is to constantly turn it on and off.No lightning have fallen near my house, nor any other extraordinary event have happened.I have looked for help from zoom, internet forums and my ISP company and all of them agreed that it is a hardware problem, apparently a common one if you buy an X6 zoom modem/router.The only definite solution: buy a new modem (not a zoom modem)"
2,Wow,"The Sisterhood of the traveling pants is one of the best books I ever read!! It is a fun exciting tale, about four best friends. It is the first summer they spend away from each other, and the way they stay in touch, is letters and the pants. The book is a great read, that you don't want to miss!"
2,The outstanding sequel comes to your home.,"This sequel to jak and daxter the precursor legacy holds itself pretty well.With a massive city and exits to outside areas, it makes for a long but very intresting storyline.Immediately after the events of jak and daxter jak, daxter, and their friends are taken far into the future. Now they are in Haven City, the large metropolis that was built over sandover village.Their arrival does not go smoothly however. Jak is imprisoned and spends two years being tortured and experimented with the dreaded dark eco.Daxter meets up with jak and the two set to exact revenge on the people who tortured jak.Very good game, it has a fantastic storyline, huge environment, and it ties it all together with the gta-inspired freedom to go where you want to go when you want to."
2,Lop Chong,This is a good sausage if you are looking for Lop Chong type of sausage. Although a little pricey
1,Another Author Induges Himself in Unsustainable Musing,"This book, which repeats so much already published, basically follows through to its initial premise: that food in america is unsustainable. Along the way, the author indulges himself in great celebrity and ego stroking wit. The segment on the boar hunting is quite hypocritical. The main thrust of the author's theory is that all systems, including alternative, are unsustainable. The conclusion he avoids, is that the failure to find a solution will result in many deaths, if not the extinction of human culture as we know it. Perhaps, all that anyone can learn here is that it is hopeless, go back home, accept your fat and your fate, and try to die quietly. So many other books are better than this one. Unless you are a total newbie to these debates, you will find little that is refreshing here. The author basically finishes where he begins, with nothing but personal insights, and no insight into a broader solution for ""sustainable"" food sources."
1,No electricity whatsoever,"I like Sandra Bullock and I like romantic comedies--so I ordered this movie. Big waste of money for me. Sandra Bullock had no charm for me whatsoever--it's like she delivered her lines deadpan. Not a trace of electricity between the two at any point. When they had their first ""serious"" kiss I was almost embarrassed for them, it was so perfunctory. On the same flight I watched Midnight in Paris (where we were flying to). It was awesomely beautifully filmed. Got the taste of The Proposal out of my mind."
1,This book and its series are overrated.,"*3 Little Firefighters* has just under 300 words, and it's part of a series purporting to deal with math skills. So you really have to wonder what kind of breathtakingly incompetent editor would allow a number error to make it into such a small book--on p. 11, the text says, ""We've got to find four sets,"" when in fact, the book is only dealing with three sets. Now, obviously, a parent dealing with a child who can't read yet can correct this mistake himself, but I think the error is indicative of the lack of care and thought that has gone into these books. The rhymes lack creativity, the stories have no charm, and most of the books, including this one, try to teach skills that a child should pick up naturally through daily interaction with an adult. My advice: Skip this one; skip the whole series.And whoever was supposed to edit this book at HarperTrophy should learn how to read."
2,Perfect Accessory,"I bought this primarily because it was the same color, but it has saved me so many times! This case protects my RAZR from my clumsiness. I haven't had any problems with the strap..."
2,Great product - especially for the price,"Needed to be thoroughly cleaned in soapy water (though I've read this is standard on all badger brushes - otherwise they smell like wet badger!) A great buy though. Most Badger brushes are $50+, and I'm sure they are more luxurious, but this one makes a great lather quickly and won't break the bank. Mine lost a few hairs at first, but hasn't lost any in the past few shaves.EDIT - downgrading to 4 stars - still recommended at this price, but started loosing hairs again after 2 weeks."
2,She is fantastic!,"If you really wanna dance...come on this is your chance! And ""No more tears"" is amazing with Tina Arena - for those who enjoyed this song, it's a gift!!!Dim all the Lights sounds lovely as a love song and should be re-recorded for sure!Every tune is perfect, it's pure 70's and when its over you are feeling much happier!Buy it and you'll see! ;)"
1,If you want good results. try something else.,I bought this camera because of one unique function-- water proof (that's the reason I give it 2 *.) I didn't expect the image quality was that POOR. Put it this way. My 7 yrs old 3mp olympus C3030 took MUCH better pictures than this modern piece of S**t. 'Nuff said.
1,Update: April-2012......Dangerous to any pet that is old and may have,any type of breathing or respiratory problems............This pad is great - BUT sheds horribly! Balls are tiny linty/shedding fuzz balls - no matter if you brush it daily before letting the animal on it .............. If your pet is older [or even a puppy] it can INHALE this shedding matter as well as have it get into their eyes............. Reduced rating from 3 to 1 ******************************************************************seems to constructed well and need strictly for lap holder for a 5# 'old dawg' wants into lap while we at PC. Wanted b/cuz other lap/carrier pad slips all over -Inside flat bottom actually 9 X 17 NOT 22x13 - rolled edges account for 4 and 5 inch difference. This should work for 'chin rest' ....
2,soothing and re-listenable,"if you enjoy Winston'esque piano solos, this is one for your collection. The mood is introspective and with feeling. I've listened to this many, many times and I still find passages that say something new."
2,good for what you need,Well i was searching online for a Zune sync cable for my 120gb Zune. i still have the one it came with but i needed another one because i mostly keep my Zune in my car so i can listen to my music while i drive. then i came across this product. i saw how cheap it was so i decided to buy it! it came around a week later. actually6 days i think. when i opened the package it was very nicely wrapped for shipping. came tied inside some plastic bubble wrap inside a bigger plastic bag inside an even bigger yellow envelope! one thing that i kinda didn't really like is that it wasn't actually the really Zune brand cable but a different company that made the cable to fit a Zune. But for paying only 3 bucks for basically the EXACT same thing that i could go to the store and get for 20 bucks. i definitely would go for the 3 buck one. =P
1,The Worst,"This is the worst video ever, it's not even funny. Spare yourself and avoid buying and watching this movie, it will result in a loss of 2hours of your life."
2,Through the Magical Path of the Labyrinth,"This last book by Jeff Saward, the well-known photographer and labyrinth historian, is a well illustrated and documented work based on his research on the field since the 1980s.Through an extensive historical analysis of such an archetypal symbol - from the pre-historic Spanish petroglyph labyrinths to the modern revival - the author shows and describes almost all the labyrinths known up to the moment.Although with some lacks (especially on literary labyrinths) this book, with its catalogue of the worldwide known labyrinths - the most comprehensive list ever since - is a useful (and an indispensable) tool to the beginner and the expert alike."
2,I love Sherlock Holmes,"I had to buy it. It was the only Sherlock Holmes movie I didn't own. It is my first Blu-ray purchase. I am delighted. Thanks to Amazon Prime, shipping was already paid for and I got it really fast."
2,Dead of Winter,This book was ordered for my son inlaw because he had started reading the author and like the way he wrote so I found more for him.
1,Lareby has lost it,"I bought this film for the script writer: the great Bob Lareby, responsible for ""As Time Goes By"" and ""Good Neighbors."" Here the box declares ""Air Raids, Gangsters, Big Bands and Bombs."" Well, that's what you get, and very little else. The writing is alarmingly limp; for a comedy nothing here is worth a smile unless you still find chase scenes entertaining. The acting is above average, and a lot of money went into the project. But one comes away with nothing: no laughs, no depth, no meaning, not even a decent plot. You've been serenaded by Glenn Miller clones and seen a lot of period costumes and sets. Hey, I can see the real thing on the History Channel for no charge (except, of course, endless commercials). In short, don't start out with great expectations, as I did. Lareby and company have offered us next to nothing for our time and money."
2,Roots of Rock,"Listen to this to unearth the roots of luminaries like Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones! Beautifully remastered, this is indeed the soma juice of planet rock."
2,Great Vocals,He has an amazing voice... Captivating even! Sounds like Josh Groban... With a Christian theme. I love this CD!
1,Cheaply made,"These fog lights are not worth the money! Put them on my 4runner in California and drove to Colorado and when I got there the yellow coating was gone and I had white fog lights again. When I finally got home, one of the bulbs blew out. What are the chances? Cheaply made."
2,Great Game,This a fun adventure! I am new to adventure games and this was good. The puzzles were not too hard to figure out. I did have to cheat a little bit.
2,Foolproof,"Having tried many times many times to add a towing connector on my vast array of ancient cars, once I tried a seven pin, never again, I was extremely skeptical about adding a four pin flat towing connector to my 2006 Subaru Tribeca.How wrong I was. IT WAS A BREEZE. The hardest thing was removing the small black plastic Phillips head screws from the storage tray which sat over the spare tire. If you are a non mechanical type do not let this worry you.An excellent product and so easy to add to your car."
2,fair compilation,"This is a mixed emotion album. Five songs off this hits package was never really released until this album came out. The sound quality sounds low so you will have to turn up the volume to get the full effect. The Zombies are a great band. They were in the industry for three years, and had three top ten hits. Two of those three went to #1. I would recommend you get, Odeesy & Oracle and Singles A & B's to get the full effect of The Zombies magical music!"
1,Too much focus on food...,"I am on my 4th pregnancy, and it was the first book I bought with my first. Definately the ""Best Odds Diet"" is extreme. The author alots you ONE dessert or ""splurge"" per month. And then to ruin the excitement of splurging she tells you to pick something semi nutritious like carrot cake. The book acts like your child will be deficient if you take one bite of anything with sugar, deep fried or salty. Ridiculous!!! I spent the better half of my first pregnancy in fear of eating sweets or processed meats! This diet will ruin any special occasion dinner, vacation or treat.There is some good info in the book, but I wish there was more on the development of the baby. I wish it told you what weeks lined up with the nine months."
1,Glue Gun with out Glue Stick,"Dear Seller,I can't rate your item because there was no any glue stick. I wouldn't mind to pay more but get at least one glue stick. Now, I can't find for mini Glue Gun ""mini stick"". Pointless to buy online instument without inlcuding accessory."
2,"""PARIS HILTON HAS AN EXCELLENT STYLE!""","These earings make an excellent date, Christmas, or special ocassion gift! People would love to own one of those beautiful earings! I am the reviewer of Cold Mountain and Sony Video Camera. I like these as much as someone else would! If you want to look beautiful, wear these!"
1,Pissed at misrepresentation!,"I didn't receive a book, not the paperback edition I ordered. I received something they called a ""binder-ready"" edition. That term was only found on the packaging after I finally received it. Nowhere in the online order did it say I was ordering, not a book, but just loose copies of the pages, that I would then have to binder myself--NOT WHAT I ORDERED BECAUSE NOT WHAT I WANTED!I feel very deceived and wasted my time ordering, waiting, shipping back, and finaly buying what I wanted elsewhere. I used to trust Amazon, now I feel betrayed and unable to trust them. That kind of information is critical and should be explained in the information--before--purchasing! Shame on Amazon!"
2,great product,"smells great and clears your complexion , it even lightens your skin a bit , it make the whole room smell like sandalwood !"
1,Not made well,The shaver head keeps leaving silver markings on the skin. It won't wash away. It is from the type of metal used. It is not comfortable to handle and the head is too big.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,I am extremely disappointed - I also thought I was buying 4 balls. The ad is very deceiving. My dog also loves the face balls - don't know why but she treats them like babies. I am very upset that I paid that price plus shipping for one small ball. BE WARNED
1,No too impressed,"Ok, Im really shocked at how much others love this game. I was bored within the first 3-4 workouts. Im not by any means a workout pro but I felt this program was too slow for me. I just got it 3 days ago and will continue to give it a chance, but as for now Im thinking about returning it and just continue to hit the gym!"
2,Great Christmas Present Choice!,"I bought these shoes for my husband for Christmas and he loves them! He wears them almost every day. I couldn't find any blue and yellow kicks at the mall, so I got on the ever-faithful Amazon.com and found a true winner. I couldn't be more pleased!"
2,The game plan,This is an amazing review of history and a blue print of the end. This book outlines the agenda of civilization and it's dire consequence. You can't help from not seeing this play out through the current events of today. Communisum is alive and well.
1,Don't read this book if you really want to learn something!,"Ms Coulter may be a pretty blond (which she does her best to flount at her TV appearances) but her tongue and opinions are quite poisonous. I guess some people just hate President Clinton and there is probably nothing he could have done to change their opinions. I just don't see the high crimes committed by Clinton. Judging by our more recent experiences with another president (Mr. Bush), Clinton wasn't that bad. Leaving aside pre-determined attitudes, Ms Coulter really doesn't add much to our learning experience. If you want Clinton bashing (hating is a better word) you may enjoy the book but if you really want to learn something meaningful about Clinton presidency you won't get much out of this book. Ms Coulter plays the role of sensational story-teller relatively well."
2,Love it!,"Excellent product,very good quality! I have used this many times since purchasing less then a month ago and not one problem. Will recommend to all my friends."
1,Disappointing!,"This is the first novel by DuMaurier that I didn't finish! I loved all of her other books that I have read, but ..... I would not recommend this one...."
1,Dreary print and dreary production,"First, the print. The entire DVD appears to be overexposed by about one stop. The colors are somewhat washed out. It appears to be a poor transfer. I have watched another copy and it has the same problem. It is not a horrible problem and if you don't pay attention to photography you may not even notice it, but it is disappointing if you do.As to the production itself, it certainly is interesting in many respects and a great deal of effort has gone into recreating the period. Unfortunately the same amount of effort did not go into dramatic pacing. This is a slow plodding effort with no clear direction.If you like these period pieces simply because they are period pieces you may like this, but if you are expecting a brilliant print and a sparkling drama you will be disappointed."
1,move on,"Contigo made the best mug I ever had... it was the contigo extreme prior to 2010. I still have it, it is a tank it doesnt leak. even if you drop it. I got 2 of these thinking it would be good to have some extra mugs for when i leave mine at work. This model is not even close!! to the quaity of the old mugs. in addition to that, the way the coffee comes out of the spout is certian to burn the heck out of your lip. My wife thought I was being fussy until she had the same thin happen. This is a lot of money for a mug you will only use twice. move on to something else."
1,Run...Hide...from this movie,"Sometimes a movie could have been good, but it just misses the mark. If only the budget had been higher, the acting better, etc.This is not that movie. Supposedly based upon a true story(which I was interested enough in to watch all the DVD features...nothing more than a passing reference), this movie has enough plot to fill out 7 minutes, and it pads it out with 65 minutes of filler. The acting of the lead is decent, but everyone else is pretty awful. The scares range from dumb to cheesy, and most of the ""thrilling"" bits are direct steals from John Carpenter'sHalloween.As far as budget issues go, the filmmakers needed to realize their limitations and not shoot 90% of the movie at night if they can't afford to light it well enough to be watchable. It is literally impossible to tell what is going on in most of the scenes in the movie.Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,poor quality,Table was damaged when shipped and the table top is not very rugged. We keep the table as we are going to cover it.
2,Greatest water kettle!,"I have had this kettle for over 3 years and use it daily. It has always worked perfectly, great for making a cup of coffee without having to use the coffee maker. I couldn't live without it!"
1,if it sounds (reads) too good to be true...,"need i continue. Junk. I had better quality with a string and 2 steel cans (one fitted to USB). I wanted something cheap and got it. Im not going to even waste any more time looking for a driver or whatever, nor bother emailing the seller. From now on I will read more than 1 review about a product. And that's all I can advise anyone else."
1,OK,"This book was ok to me. It dragged on quite a bit but I really liked the ending. I didn't like how it would talk about the same thing for over 3 chapters. It just felt like it wasn't my kind of book. However, I liked the last part. The last 5 chapters were probably that only part I liked."
1,RmLamatt author of Fears Flutterby,"I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it."
1,"""Crummy"" Bread Slicer","Purchased this bread slicing guide to replace my all wood one I have had for 15 years. Got it sometime in June. I found it to be flimsy, the slats on the bread catcher were too thin and soon would break from the knife groove from slicing the bread. Well, I didn't have to worry about that because the first plastic guide broke right off. 15 years for the old one and less than 4 months for this one. What a waste of money!"
2,This CD rocks ! You have to get it!,"Switchfoot is awesome! They have great guitars from Jon Foreman and his brother, Tim Foreman, and excellent drums from Chad Butler. Their lyrics are really cool,too. Almost every song on this CD is worth listening to, but my favorites are numbers 1,2,4,7,&10. Number 6 is pretty good also. If you like good alternative/rock music you have to buy this CD."
1,The bags are oily,"I have bought this brand in the stores for several months and was happy to see I could get it with subscribe and save. But after this last order, I have cancelled my subscription, because EVERY bag in EVERY box was oily on the outside before even being popped. This is quite atrocious. I have not had this problem with the 6 count boxes I purchase in the store. I do not understand why it is like this, but I can't bring myself to continue purchasing this particular product in the 3 count boxes."
1,Save your money!,I have used many skin care creams. This is by far the worst! It is overpriced and leaves your skin looking worst than before you used it. It makes your skin look dry and pastey. Take my advice do not purchace this cream.
2,A nice walk down memory lane with some great Christmas music,"I was a preteen Osmond fan when I bought the original record - a double album set. It instantly became my favorite Christmas album and even after growing out of my Osmond years, I still enjoyed this particular album every Christmas. Then record players eventually went the way of the dinosaur and I had to put the album away. I was excited to see the CD version come out and ordered it. While some of my favorite tracks remain in tact, others seemed to have changed to include Marie and others were completely gone. With this CD, a lot of great Christmas music is back, but sadly, some great Osmond harmonies are missing (most notably the caroling medley)."
1,review,"Its a nice price, but it takes a really long time heat up and is not as effective as i would have guessed. I should have just bought a regular crimper."
2,Cancel Any Other Plans,Is there therapy or a 1-800 number people can call that become addicted to this game? It's that good. I'm the last person to buy a game with cars involved. I love going around shooting things. This game is hand down one of the best games ever and I have my own library. Thanks to this game I have a permanent dent in my couch from the hours I've spent playing it. I think I've missed meals because I was too busy busting a cap into some bad guys. I can't think of anything bad worth mentioning. The missions just go on and on and they're all very different. I went ahead and orderd the first GTA. This game rocks.
1,Where are the REAL hits?,"Ok, at least one song in particular. ""YOU (you're the one for me)""....This song received continuous play on R & B radio stations back in the 80's. It was the most beautiful ballad and I loved it. Now, I cannot find this song ANYWHERE!""I played the game of loving 2, loving 3...once before....but with you, I dont need to play them, anymore. Ask me who I want and I'll tell you. Girl, it's you......""Hello, twenty some odd years later, I can remember most of the lyrics....C'mon, this is a travesty to all of the true One Way fans!!!"
1,still have thin lips :0(,"I used the city lips lip plumper for 30 nights without fail,,,,,and it did nothing,,,,,it was a total waste of money for me."
1,"scary to use, UNSAFE!","My Mom bought this at the local grocery store one desperate night when my very old one from the 70s quite working. Thank goodness it worked that night, and the following but the next cold my child got it was a scary machine. It sputtered water (HOT water) all over, about 3 feet. The night light would flicker as it surged with power to make steam. I finally used it in my room one night as I was very sick, and it made the house lights surge, and between the spewing water all over and the strange electrical crackling it made I tossed it in the trash right away.Now in the market for a new I asked my neighbor what she has, she too has this model and hers behaves in a very similar way!"
1,Instructions,I need instructions for installation and operation of the Bell bicycle speedometer. Can you email them to me. Thank you.
1,Not worth the extra money,"Bought this ""Energizer"" product hoping it would work better than the cheap no name batteries I previously purchased and reviewed as not good and this more expensive product does not work any better than the $2-3 versions of this battery. It will not charge in remote charger, it does not hold a charge for any longer than the cheap batteries. My conclusion is if you have to live with replacement batteries like I am doing, just buy the cheap ones and replace them every 6 months. Or, as I am about to do, just buy a completely new phone system just to get new OEM batteries that charge in remote charger and last more than 1 day on a charge."
1,Soft But Not Sturdy,"These boots feel great on your feet, but I had the same problem as other where the buttons just fall off..Seems like a consistent quality issue. If you don't mind the defect they do feel warm and cozy."
1,I Do NOT Recommend This Product,"Yes it sucks up debris, but the suction is very poor, it taks quite a bit of effort to get the max suction, the amount of debris it captures is very small, and if your spa is of decent size (6-8 people), it takes forever to pick up a considerable amount of debris."
1,Chatty and catty,"As a psychologist and couples therapist, I picked up this book in the hopes that I could recommend it to my clients. I was thoroughly disappointed by the format, content, and length of this guide. Like many of the previous reviewers who were critical, I too found much that offended. It struck me as odd that in choosing to be three co-authors, it did not occur to these women that a male perspective would be an essential contribution. The book was anecdotal, providing little empirical support for the authors' viewpoints. Unlike these writers, I will be brief and circumspect. Instead of this book, you would be much better served by purchasing the Gottmans' And Baby Makes Three."
2,A true page turner,"I couldn't put it down; opened it on a Thurs. night and closed it Sun. When I wasn't reading it, I found myself pre-occupied wanting to get back to the book. Although fictional, the portrayal of the characters could very well have been true."
2,Best $4 you can spend !,"I bought these after witnessing a gouge in my friend's unprotected LCD screen on his Brand New $500 digital camera ! I have several cameras with varying LCD sizes. This product is perfect as it allows me to cut out the different sizes that I need without spending a small fortune. Btw, it comes with cut-out templates on the back of each card which is extremely helpful ! A Must-Buy !!!"
2,Never get lost again!,"Bought this for my mother, and used it right after Christmas. Product work straight out of package. It is fairly accurate, took it on a long trip. Battery lasts about 3 hours. On a 6 hour drive, we had to use the included d/c power cord.This device is good for entry level. Has SD card slot for updates, and bluetooth for your cellphone. Great turn by turn, only had one Error in its map on our drive.All in All a good device, just need to use some common sense and it will server you well."
1,"Cool, but what about software?","The basic mouse functions are great. It has good accuracy, feels good in the hand, it's pretty, and I like the potential of actually using the 6 other controls when Logitech updates their software. I followed the excellent instruction booklet to install this on my Windows 2000 Dell computer, but I was never able to find a way to assign commands to the extra controls. The installed software thought I had a 2 button mouse. I zoomed on over to Logitech's website to look for solutions and downloaded the current version of the mouse software. However, even Logitech's updated software can't recognize anything more than a 2 button mouse. I have since removed all of Logitech's software, sent them an e-mail explaining the problem, and I still have effectively a cute 2 button cordless mouse. I suppose I expected more from top-of-the-line"
1,Save your money,"I had read the reviews here and thought I'd download the ""sample"". Oh my god, this writer is so arrogant. Who but she to string words together? Honestly, I got through 3 pages; that was enough."
2,Hard to put down,"Ethan Decker is a broken man. Something went wrong while on assignment for the CIA and his five-year-old son was killed. He leaves his wife and his job and is hiding out in the desert fighting his demons. A few years later an old operative from his team shows up, two children in tow. She dumps the kids and takes off, and when Ethan catches up with her, she's dead. The only clue is the last call she made on her cell phone - to Ethan's ex-wife, Sydney. The children tell him a fantastic story of being kidnapped and held on an island by people they call the ""Keepers,"" and thus begins a cross country chase where the line between the good guys and the bad guys keeps jumping. Plan on sitting put for a while, this one is hard to put down."
1,Do not order based on picture,"In the picture it shows a twin pack, but you only receive 1 ink cartridge. Can we say false advertising?"
2,Great family flick!,"This is my favorite kids' movie in years! Funny, great music, interesting story, even lessons to talk about! My children 5,6,7,9 all love it as well. Definitely a keeper!"
2,The Ultimate Gift,Wonderful! Beautiful story. Great life lessons. Great for kids and adults alike. I hope to see more of Drew Fuller!
1,mama mia,"I am very dissapointed in the quality of this product as it skips in some places, we tried different players with no change. I was also mislead on the dvd which I assumed was the complete show.Howard Kool"
1,Don't waste your time.,"The author is a politically correct atheist who feels compelled, on nearly every page, to tell you how advanced the Chinese and Islamic civilizations were in the Middle Ages despite the fact that mechanical clocks were invented in Europe. Her anti-Christian and anti-Western asides got so disgusting I had to toss the book in the garbage."
2,the art of gem cutting,good littlebook with a lot on information a little dated but still very useful
1,poorly designed brush assembly,"wish I had not bought this. The actual vacuum is fine, very strong, but the attachment is very poorly designed. The brush spins by suction and is easily stopped. the whole brush assembly completely fell apart the first time I dropped it, which is easy to do because of the awkward two-hand approach needed to use it."
1,Rice crusty on the bottom,There are two major problems for this rice cooker:1. liquid bubbles over when half filled.2. Rice crusty on the bottom.
2,A must for photographers and Usa lovers...,It would be better to have descriptions under the pictures and not at the end of each section... But beautiful
1,Geometry Book Review,Terrible communication and shipping. Paid for expidited shipping and took over three weeks to get to me. Vendor blamed it on Amazon. I have been a customer of Amazon for nearly 2 years and have never had a problem with communication between vendors. This vendor didn't offer to refund my expedited shipping after taking so long to ship even after I asked. Sorry to say I would not order from again and would I recommend to others.
2,Amazing!,"Very easy to use and takes all the confusion out of making rice! I was a bit confused as to what was happening after I pressed ""Cook"" but Zojirushi Rice Cooker 'sang' a song when the rice was ready and it was perfect."
1,Not his best,"There's something funny going on with this music on this CD. It's as if the instruments are playing one thing and vocals are doing another. I've never done drugs, but somehow this makes me feel like I am - as if what I've read about taking LSD or some other type of hallucinogen is true. Perhaps that's what he was on when he recorded it. :-)"
2,Visit Harmony and you will never want to leave,"Phillip Gulley is my favorite author. I have waited a long time for the second book in the Harmony series. Mr. Gulley has a way of writing in such a way you can feel the spirit. What a gift he has been given.Just shy of Harmony continues the glimpse in the lives of the citizens of Harmony Indiana and the Harmony friends meeting.The stories are filled with warmth, love, and compassion.I am ready for the next installment of this wonderful story.I encourage you to visit Harmony and sit a while at the legal grounds coffee shop and make sure you get a scripture egg!!!!!"
2,Great Stuff,"Sharon Fiffer's DEAD GUY'S STUFF is a smart, funny and satisfying must read. Fiffer's weaving of family, career and murder is impeccable and lots of fun. By twists and turns the story is jampacked with surprises and revelations about life that tickle the reader's funny bone while at the same time evoking the deep ""Aha"" that makes reading a story so satisfying. I can't wait until the next book comes out so I can learn more secrets about Jane Wheel and everyone whose life she touches."
1,Toby Keith DVD,"This could have been so good it's ashaimed,He left out all the best vidios.I realy was dissapointed.I thought I would get,The angry american or beer for my horses.Or even I love this bar or look at me now or who's your daddy? But I got none of these.this was designed to start a series of collections.these were supposed to be the best of his videos instead it turned out to be his worst.Maybe the next one will be better."
1,I received the product offered,Waiting excitedly Wii console and when we received was not what was ordered. Decia include Wii Sports and it was totally a hoax. It brought them included. So to date I could not use it.
2,Fantastic book!!!,"I bought this book over 20 years ago and when I adhere to her exercise routine, I am in the best shape ever. Some are difficult to do, but once you do, you'll be amazed at the results! Best thing is, it's a great cool down exercise after aerobic exercise while working your muscles to the max. Easy to do on the living room floor or anywhere in the house. Can't say enough good about this!!!!!"
1,reasonable/not working,"not happy,use all the time and this year its not working so good,hanged to another brand.good price but not happy with product nymore"
1,Get the Blu Ray of The Road Warrior instead!!!,"This is a real shame,sure it contains both Road Warrior and its sequel Thunderdome but they are FULL SCREEN VERSIONS,the beautiful camera work cant be enjoyed to the fullest,if it were 1.85 films that might have been somewhat accepable,but these were filmed in 2.35,so you loose allmost 50% of the picture,it;s like getting half a movie!!! Would have been great if they were widescreen transfers,but no such luck here,if you got a Blu Ray player,than get the Road Warrior in that format,heck the price is not much higher than this one!!! Like I said go Blu!!!"
1,Tweezer problem,"I received this multi tool and it seemed very useful at first.HOWEVER, there are tweezers that at least for me were a nightmare to remove and impossible to reinsert.I could not find specific instructions on use of the tweezers on the enclosed papers.The tweezers are held in a plastic piece with a slot for the tweezers that rotates out (and then in).I wish I had never used the tweezers so I could keep this multi tool but since I cannot reinsert this sheet and tweezers I have to return this tool."
2,An enchanting read best of Jane Austen,"This book is one of my all-time favorites. Jane Austen makes her elegant ladies, country girls,and intriguing gentlemen alive with strong, wonderful detail. The characters were well developed, my favorite was Elizabeth, the strong willed protagonist. The plot is almost never slow. I never could predict what would happen next as the plot wound through each of the character's personal lives and through the society of England in that time period. I recommend this book to anyone who loves the classics and books that have many different levels of thought in the plot. I also recommend this book to readers of the Bronte sisters. Enjoy!"
1,Disappointment!!!!!,I ordered this product in plenty of time for Christmas... kept trying to track package and there was nothing...called company and they told me that it was on backorder and not available until after January 8th...asked why they didn't let me know..no explanation...I cancelled the order....communications not good at all....
1,"Fails from ""IR interference"" from LCD or Plasma!","I thought that my Channel Plus 3025 was at fault when ALL of my 2133 IR targets in different rooms failed to work. But tech support said it's because of IR interference from LCD and plasma TV's. They said the target needn't be in line-of-sight with the TV for this problem to occur, just near it and they couldn't say how far away would fix this. They told me to use Xantech IR receivers instead, but I coudn't find a Xantech model with the RF in and out jacks needed.Their tech support is very good, by the way, but had lousy news.So now what.. send back the 2133's and the 3025 and start over? Or switch to CRT TV's?"
2,Best anime ever made!,"A very compelling piece of work. Great animation, great sound, an interesting story set in an alternate early 20th century and contains interesting references to actual authors, philosophers and so forth.It's funny, tragic and actionpacked. It's scifi, fantasy and adventure in a rare blend; I'm very much not a fan of sci-fantasy crossovers but done right Steam/Diesel Punk can be awesome and FMA does do it right.The flaws, IMO, lie in that alot of the story line is actually quite predictable (at least if you're a geek like me who thinks he's ""seen it all""). Moreover I would like to see the characters evolve a bit more, but I was very satisfied by the last few episodes. Character and story-wise I feel that the series would have benefited if the characters evolved to their final states a bit earlier, and maybe added some extra twists in the end.I will definately watch the series again, and hopefully notice new things the second time around."
1,This item is so tiny,DO not buy this. It is so tiny and is almost useless. It is only good for hanging 1 or 2 keys.
2,"Reunion with ""BREAD""","It was wonderful to bring back the ""oldies"" of BREAD, who were one of my favorite groups of the 70's. I bought this album especially for ""Diary"", but was so pleasantly pleased for all the other wonderful, memorable tunes also included."
2,It was good,I enjoyed this book because it was engaging and character development coninued throughout. My only complaint is that it needed to explain things a bit better.
1,Not much of an improvement in GRE score,"First of all, the GRE is the most ridiculous test ever created. In no way does it measure your intelligence, nor is it a sound device for determining your success in graduate school... But enough of that.My verbal score was very low the first time I took the GRE (330). So I decided to give this book a try, seeing it had some of the better reviews.I memorized every word in this book. I would estimate nearly 1,000 words. With the many hours spent preparing to retake the test, I was anticipating a fairly significant increase in my score.Only ONE word of the approximate 1,000 words I studied was on the test. I guess this book can be hit or miss, considering the various forms of the GRE and the adaptive features.Needless to say, when my score only increased from 330 to 350 in the verbal section I was a little distraught. Don't waste your time."
2,Looking for something to laugh at- and this works.,"I've seen the original and second American Pie films, then lost interest in the series. I was in the mood to watch something non-dramatic and funny, and this is exactly what it was. Definitely not on par with Citizen Kane, but that's not what I was looking for! So all in all, I'd recommend it."
2,Must have for people that love to bike!!,"They are in search for the holy trail all over the world...they hit places like Spain, Switzerland, morocco...all over...In sane jumps, stunts and downhills...A MUST HAVE FOR THE MOUTAIN BIKER ENTHUSIAST"
2,"Widow of Larkspur Inn, The","I really had a good time reading ""TheWidow of Larkspur Inn "". It was thoroughly enjoyable, and I will read more books from this author."
2,A great story teller!,"Wow....I started reading this book and 24 hours later it was finished. I was fascinated by the whole tale. True love, murder, mystery, action packed.....I say good bye to Patterson and Hello to Coben. Harlan Coben can really write a good book."
2,great value!,"This phone is a great value for the price range. works exactly as described, with no problems. would buy again if needed!"
1,Interesting book but tedious and dated,"first the good: Ms Hamilton is very knowledgeable on the subject and provides a great deal of connection between the Classical Greek and modern thought. The book contains a great deal of food for thought.Now the bad. First, I don't really care for the writing style. This is however a fairly minor issue compared to a bigger issue: bad comparisons.You can't compare a good translation of Classical Greek (such as Pindar) in Modern English and say how contemporary something sounds. Of course it sounds contemporary, if the translator was any good... In fact, Pindar and Homer composed works which would be, on the whole, very different from what people write today. The focus on similarities, especially in translation, is quite misleading.On the whole, I think some people would get something out of this book, but I think there are far better works which address both similarities and differences."
1,Not my favorite,"I've read numerous Nora Roberts books and usually enjoy them for the characters and how she develops them. This book lacked that. As another reviewer mentioned, I also found that I couldn't connect to the characters and found them unlikeable and a bit flat. I finished the book because I felt I should, but I didn't like it. I did like Roberts' Blue Smoke and Blue Dahlia, both of which take more time with the story. I'd recommend spending the money on them over this."
2,One of her best,"Kinsey Milhone and Stephanie Plum are two of my favorite characters. I read this latest Kinsey Milhone book and liked it. Then I read a number of reviews here and saw that many people liked the book while others were disappointed. I want to add my name to the list of those who found the book very enjoyable. I'm a sucker for a Kinsey Milhone romance and the plot in this book and other characters, both new and the usual (like Henry) were up to the usual Sue Grafton standards. My only problem now is, when do I get to read another Kinsey Milhone or Stephanie Plum book? In the meantime, there is a new book out starting a series that seem to have potential (Deadly Diamonds by Pamela Troutman). Great characters, very funny, nice plot."
1,Not very easy to fill,This bird feed is not what I expected. Too hard to fill and the different seeds get mixed up. Would not purchase another.
2,Book seem to work for my son,"I never read the book, but my son (14) read it in a few days last week and then he went 4 for 5 that weekend. That ended a huge slump for him. I'm not sure what the book did for him, but when I asked, he said something about humming tunes, breathing techniques, confidence, and routines. He also was doing something funny with his glove. He called it part of ""his routine"". My son could hit in the batting cages and practice but not so well in the games. That changed this last weekend. Only difference was this book. But could be coincidence. Will see over the next few weeks. His coaches and hitting coach always tell him his problem is in his head. Sounds like a common problem for all baseball players from little league to Major Leagues."
2,I wish...,...i had never heard Fair to Midland before hearing this music but cant help making comparisons. It is still wonderful music and Ill explore it further...
2,The terror begins when she meets her new stepsister...,This book was so good and pretty freaky at the same time! It all started when Emily and Nancy get a new stepsister name Jessie. When she moved into Emily's room the terror began...Emily wants to like her new stepsister Jessie and get to know her. Until things happen and Jessie blames Emily and lies. Emily wants to know Jessie's secrets and she finds her dairy.Then Emily knew that did not do the things. It was her sister! Nancy tries to kill Emily because she was going crazy about it. She ends up going to the hospital because she was going crazy.What will happen next? Find out on the Stepsister 2 the conclusion of the story and see for yourself what happens next.
1,This guy has no talent what-so-ever.,"I feel sick that they categorized this never-was with Dave Matthews Band. People should be ashamed to own this album, much less suggesting that it should be album of the year."
1,"Abuse, plain and simple.","If you want to learn how to abuse and neglect your child, this is a good book for you. If you are like me, and love your child way too much to even consider such a thing, stay FAR AWAY from this book. It is not discipline, it is not guidance, it is abuse. You can raise a happy, healthy, well-adjusted and obedient child without using any of the techniques in this book - I have raised 4 such children!Keep in mind that this author has written another book that has a warning against it by the American Medical Association. He has no training and no credentials behind the claims he makes."
1,Not worth it!,"This CD doesn't live up to the hype. That single, ""Where My Girls At"" has been on the ready too long! They should have released the CD 2 weeks after the single was released. I waited way too long for this CD and it was definitely not worth it."
1,THIS IS THE REVIEW YOU WANT TO READ,"Decent soundtrack. Overrated movie. Cage bores me, Ryan plays her typical self, and the idea of giving up eternal life to be with someone for this pathetically short lifetime is stupid. And no, I'm not an anti-romantic...I just don't have screwed up, selfish priorities which is exactly what this movie promoted."
2,Finally,"Yes, it's true. This is one of the best cartoons of the 80s - early 90s, along with Xmen, tmnt, and batman. Now where's season 2 of exo squad and the rest of conan?"
1,good information but hard to dig out,"Unfortunately one of the worst books I have ever read (certainly the worst layout).Whilst there is some valuable information contained in the text, the bizarre writing style (changing font / colur / caps / exclamations marks / cliches etc.) makes for hard work digging the nuggets of gold out.Personally I'd recommend spending your valuable time reading a text that's easier than this one with its appaling use of language(cool! phat! wow!) and oh-so obvious observations."
1,Rather tame by today's standards,"As this book is widely considered to be one of the best fifty of the 20th century, I was expecting something truly momumental. I am sure that it was quite shocking at the time it was published, but among today's generation of youths, even the unedited version of this book is so tame and lame that it's point has been diminished. The people in this book would be considered goody-two-shoes by today's 20-somethings. As a consequence, I do not believe that this book has withstood the test of time. Unfortunately, the continued devolution of our permissive society has rendered it essentially obsolete, and makes me wonder if this book ever had anything more going for it than shock value."
2,Almost just what I was looking for but not quite.,"This mat still works extremely well to work dough on, for biscuits, bread, cookies. I had once heard that it was so nonstick that dough rolled out on it would come off easy but my all the different kinds of dough I have used have so far stuck unless I dusted with flour first. If using cookie or biscuit cutters be careful not to press to hard or it will weaken the fibers in the mat. It had a small unravel on one end that was not a problem until my little boy found it and started pulling at it till about 2 inches were unraveled. I just cut off the messed up edge and it still works great. It stores better for me folded and in an opened ended plastic pouch I have also stored it rolled then slipped into a long paper bag. When storing be aware that the surface if the mat is a bit tacky from the silicon and whatever it is laid upon it will stick to a little and may pick up bits of for example lint, dust it has come in contact with while in storage."
2,Nice quality adapter.,"I've used the Panasonic RP-CC20 cassette adapter for several weeks now. The sound quality is great with my MP3 player. If my car engine is off, I can hear a slight mechanical sound of the cassette being 'played', but this is no different than any other cassette in the stereo and I'm unable to hear it when the engine is running. Aside from that, there's no static, humming, or other noise that I've found so far.The adapter's cord is sufficiently long that I can have the MP3 player in the back seat if I wanted to, for whatever reason. The cassette part looks and feels reasonably solid. I expect that this adapter will last for a good while."
2,INDY IS BACK!,"I cannot speak for those who are having problems with this set, but my Widescreen set is terrific. I just have one thing to comment on about those who are saying that the transfers are terrible! These films are old. Please people get over it! If a speck of dirt appears, don't worry about it. Raiders in particular is never gonna look better!! Enjoy these films now and be thankful they are even available to enjoy. It's better than allowing these gems to sit in a room decaying beyond recognition. This set is wonderful, worked fine and there were no problems."
1,"Sorry Aaron Hamburger, you are no Christopher Isherwood",The characters lack depth. Should have had less stories and focused on developing characters more (like Berlin Stories).
1,Size Chart Not Accurate,"I was really excited for this harness to arrive because I'd read so many great reviews about it. I measured my dog (a mixed breed) before placing the order according to the size chart on the packaging and found my dog could fit two possible sizes. After debating between the Med/Large and Large, I opted for the smaller size. When I put it on her, I found that after adjusting it as small as I could it was still too big. I ended up returning it, but I must say that I was really impressed with Amazon's return policy. (This was the first time I've had to return anything.) Just a couple of days after sending it back, I already had been refunded.If I decide to buy another one, I think I'm going to buy one from a store so I can make sure it fits her properly."
1,Eeech! This album really stinks!!!!!,"Whoa, this is the worst! Anyone who takes classic Broadway songs and murders them the way this guy does has no right recording CDs. His interpretations of stalwart ballads like ""Last Night Of The World"" and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" deserve the respect with which they were originally written and recorded. This guy sings every song like it's adult easy listening, the instrumentals are awful, and from these recordings I do believe he knows nothing about the stories from which these songs are gleaned. And although he doesn't have a bad voice, I do believe he fancies himself a Tom Jones of sorts and it is in the Tom Jones style that he performs.(...) Really, this guy is the worst."
2,Reverance for Life,"This is a remarkable book in so far as it brings a much greater depth to Schweitzer than one might get without it. While Schweitzer has many insightful things to write, how he writes and what he says about himself conveys quite a lot. I think the figure of Albert Schweitzer has become cliched over the decades. Reading how he saw the world is time well spent and shows how shallow cliches can be."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"These don't work at all. I printed out the same picture 3 times. One time, there was no color, another time, there was color but it was all washed out, third time, there were streaks across the whole picture. Then tried printing out a Google Maps web page, no color and barely readable. Tried the different cleaning options, none of which helped at all."
1,I don't like this american version...,this version of project A they cut scenes like the shower when everybody through a cup to Yuen Biao when he want to be the only can take a shower and many other parts the american version cut...
2,Great characterization and amazing insight,"This was my first Berg novel, and it definitely will not be my last. ""Open House"" tells the story of Sam, a woman who suddenly finds herself without a husband, with an 11-year old son that no longer needs her at every moment, and she is faced with the struggle of finding a new role and place for herself in the world. Berg's writing pins down Sam's feelings... self-doubt, fear, loneliness, etc., with a clarity and accuracy that amazed me. Sam was real and wonderful, and the cast of characters surrounding her was also fabulous. I'd definitely recommend this, and not just to those who have been through divorce... also those who wonder about their place in the world, what they're doing with their lives, and what they owe to themselves and others."
2,Deep Shadows & Brilliant Highlights,"Have you been properly introduced to H.I.M. yet? What are you waiting for?! This album, IMO, is the best album to get acquainted with their music. This album is kick a** from the door...not one bad song on it. This album solidified my commitment as now being forever a fan. You don't have to be GOTH to like this music. It is straight up melodic rock with catchy choruses and harmonies. The lyrics this guy writes will blow you mind. It captures you like nothing else could in music today. The sound of this band is what has been missing with the rock world for many years now. BUY IT PEOPLE!!"
2,The classic work,"This extraordinary text totally paved the way for the rest of Western metaphysics. It is a lucid text, though still difficult because of the complexity of the ideas. In it, Aristotle posits his famous causes of being, material, formal, efficient, final. And he conceptualizes the criteria for essence. There is almost no way to master the contents of this body of work, it has challenged the greatest thinkers ever since its rediscovery and will continue to astound and mystify for as long as it continues to exist.This translation is fair, though the Hugh Tredennick is a bit clearer."
1,Disappointed,"Needed a replacement for our Zojirushi model NMDC-R18 that we had for approx 10 years. We enjoyed rice once or twice a week till our old model went on the fritz. This Cuisinart model seemed to offer some nice features with the steaming capability, and was a good price. However, we found some deficiencies. Most disappointing is the texture of the rice - not soft and sticky like we would like. Also, the bottom layer of rice is crispy immediately, and if left to warm even fifteen or twenty minutes its brown. Another problem is that once the unit begins cooking, the lid handle is too hot ""to handle"". You need a hot pad to take the lid off. After using this model twice we are returning it and going back to the Zojirushi brand."
2,"Far fetched, but very Entertaining","I don't understand all the negative reviews on this film. We just watched it for the 2nd time, and certainly will be watching it again in the future. Pacino is well casted, and gets great support from the other players. Yes, the story line is far fetched and has been done many times. But it moves right along, and trying to connect all the dots makes it a very entertaining film IMHO"
1,Won't work with XBox 360,Very disappointed. Bought for Christmas present early - so couldn't return it. Have not been able to use it. It will not connect with XBox 360 nor will the disk play even. No one will buy it second hand too. Wasted my money. Had to buy something else similar for my daughter to use on the XBox 360.
1,Only one star because I can't rate it lower,"Avoid this movie at all costs. I could feel the intelligence rushing from my head as I watched it. It really doesn't get much worse than this. This movie has it all. The guy who does his own thing no matter what the consequences. It has Aaliyah with an inconsistant, dodgy accent, and a Ministry of Funny Walks worthy gait. A huge climactic battle with two friends turned enemies suddenly friends again kung-fu fighting side by side.I think if the stars of this movie were ugly, it would never have been released."
1,Weakest Product of the Conflicted Cop Genre,"Since ""Training Day"" everybody has wanted to make a ""conflicted LA cop"" product. Training Day was good because of the strength of the dialogue and Denzel Washington's on-screen presence. Dark Blue puts an interesting twist on the genre by setting the story during the L.A. riots, but it still fails to deliver.1) The writing just isn't there, the dialogue is not as snappy as Training Day.2) The movie is utterly predicable. I mean ""bad cop with a good heart teamed up with a young idealistic partner"", we've seen it all before.3) The riots play a very minor role in the movie.This movie sounds and feels like an extra long episode of FX's ""The Shield,"" and while Dark Blue would work on television it just doesn't deliver the goods on the big screen."
2,Decent but not the best.,"I've had this program. I'm using Click N Burn Pro now and it is as easy to use, less expensive and has the same features. Save some money and go with Click N Burn."
1,"Different title, but same DVD","I bought another DVD of the same concert. Now I have two identical DVDs. This is very deceptive. It is not right to sell a similar product with different titles. This DVD has Jimmy on the cover, but he was not eve in the concert. I felt cheated. And I bought almost every of their DVDs."
2,Good Deal,"This VCR has an excellent picture and nice auto tracking feature that was not present on my last VCR. It rewinds tapes in a jiffy and has a pretty good still image. The hidden front A/V inputs are a nice addition. The remote is rather small with hard to read buttons. The major problem I encountered was when I tried to hook it up to my magnavox DVD player via RCA plugs, the picture faded in and out with a red tint."
1,Not very helpful as a trouble shooting manual,"I recently ordered this book to help me troubleshoot an electrical problem with my 1997 Grand Prix. I am quitedisappointed with the quality of this book. It is printed on newprint paper (very low quality), and feels quite flimsy.More importantly, since this book covers such a wide range of GM ""W cars"", it contains very little specific information tohelp me with my problem. All in all I found this to be a waste of money."
2,Awesome,"I bought the additional 128 Mb Ram for my laptop. The price is simply amazing ! I have never in the past so many years seen the price of RAM drop to as low as it is right now. I ordered the 128 Mb Additional RAM for my Gateway Solo 5300 (all models). However I also think that it works great for the Gateway Solo 3350 (all models).It's very easy to install, does NOT come with the instructions. Instructions to install it will be foudn in the Gateway manuals. This is worth the money cos it speeds up your computer a lot !"
2,Enjoy Aggie,You can start with any book and still keep up with what's happening in Agatha's life. But where ever you start you will always love Aggie.
1,elem diff e-q's,"While the shipping was AMAZING, the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems. The text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out. It would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource w/o an instructor leading."
2,Good Read,"The Jack Reacher series is a great read. The writing is clear and enjoyable although Reacher seems to be almost indistructable. In other words, it is a fantasy but an enjoyable one."
2,A Memory Book That Shapes the Present,Brueggemann invites readers to Scripture study as a feast that can transform. He presents the Bible as a memory book that gives us an identity and promises a future. It is never a closed book of past events.I found the ideas presented in this book life giving. Each chapter closes with reflection questions for discussion and a meditation that connects the points from the chapter to scripture and to life.It is challenging reading and for best results share the reflections with others.Most interesting for me was that the Bible is not an answer book but a book that asks questions. In the process of living in those questions our perception of life changes. The Bible is meant to be life changing.
1,very disappointed,"I made the order on Dec 13, 2009. The email said it will be shipped between Jan 2 - 7. It's so slow, but I think that may be due to the holiday season, I can understand and I can wait. However, today (Jan 9th) I got an email said ""We're still trying to obtain the following item. Still want it? We'll keep on trying. We'll cancel your order on February 07 2010, if we haven't located it by then."" Speechless... If you DO NOT have the product, please DO NOT list it on the website. Please DO NOT waste time for both of us. Thanks."
2,Transforming to Dune,"My Review of DJ Morgan's ArrakisAs soon as you hear the intro you are reminded that Morgan is the artist that gave us Decepticon. If Hard NRG, heavy bass and stomping beats are what you have been craving you are not going to be disappointed as you listen to track two. As the CD progresses the samples from the movie Dune add to the artistry of this mix proving that Morgan is defining the Hard NRG genre by example and honing his own conceptual talents. I hope to catch the switch from tracks 6 to 7 on a dance floor in St Louis this summer. For all of you Hard NRG dancers out there I suggest taping up your ankles because handstands and back flips are possible by track 7. From Intro to Conclusion Arrakis is 100% of Morgan's best to date."
2,Nesco roaster,"I wanted you to know that I enjoy using the roaster oven it is easy and convenient. I can start my mail and not worry about it. However I would like to know if you can send me a cooking guide as I lost mine and like to try new meals. Thank you for your time.Sincerely,Sharlene K."
1,Adequate But Flimsy,"We bought this rice cooker to replace one that we had used for more than a decade. While this item works, it is flimsy. I would be tempted to buy a more substantial one."
2,magical,"Good job Madonna.. It isn't any easy job to write children's book where you need to be simple in story telling yet strong with the message, not to mention the challenge to grap attention and interest of a kid. You did it and you did it beautifully. The book is beautifully written, simple, yet powerfull. Proceeds will go to charity- a great thing as she is not doing it for earning more money, and becoming more famous."
2,It works!,Got this tongue cleaner for my husband and he's very pleased with it. He says it works great. It's a must-have for all those with whitish tongues and bad breath!
1,Not so magnificent,"Coming out in dvd very late and in a bad copy does not help Orson Welles' reputation, and The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) is simply a stuffy old movie, crowded with equally stuffy drapes, furniture and mansions. The story of the arrogant son, torturing his widowed mother and other family(ies) of a medium size American town a good hundred years ago lacks any grand design his Citizen Kane (1941) has been praised for. Today, The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Touch of Evil (1958) and The Trial (1962) are perhaps his best secondary films, and much of his other stuff - well, junk."
1,let down,"I bought this flask and I was very disappointed. This is because it was leaking!! There was a very small leak at the bottom of the flask. Overnight, it would be stuck to the counter in the morning. I then contacted Jillian Leather, and in turn they responded, but never did anything about it. I was very disappointed with the flask and the customer service."
1,Doesn't work,I wore this necklace several times and now realize that I wasted my money. I can't even tell the necklace even has any titanium ... there is no magnetic field. If you want true titanium (no clothe cover)and that does seem to work ... stay way from the 'cloth' covered ones since you can't verify what is underneath unless to disassemble to necklace. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,Worth boycotting on principle,"New Order was a singles band who did their best work in the 12"" format. However, none of Warner Brothers' six - count 'em, six - compilations contain all of those original 12"" mixes. ""Substance"" has the most of them. But it replaces the original versions of ""Temptation"" and ""Confusion"" with re-recordings - and lops a minute or more off ""The Perfect Kiss"", ""Sub-Culture"", and ""Shellshock"". To remedy these defects, Warner Brothers requires you to purchase ""Collector's Editions"" of the three separate albums containing those songs. [If you do a web search for ""sorting out the New Order compilations"", you can get full details.]Well, screw that. All of the music from the original 12"" records is available for free on the Internet, if you know where to look. You can also get the original sleeve art - something else ""Substance"" couldn't be bothered with."
2,Making bread is easier!,"Wow!If you like a fresh baked loaf of bread and have a baking stone and need a pizza-bread paddle,grab this one.Looks good and works good.Good price also.Don't hesitate-just buy it! AAAAA+++++"
1,don't waste your money,"at least it was cheap. i read a great review of this somewhere but apparently that person hadn't actually seen the movie otherwise they would have known that 42 minutes into it the 'editor' (a term i use very loosely) cut back in 5 minutes of footage that had already been shown. aside from that, the interviews are random, the editing is incoherent, and the whole disc is a waste of 64 minutes. i threw it away as soon as i finished it as there's no one that i dislike enough to subject them to this waste of time and $12."
2,great looking set,i have the first two dragon box sets and if this one is like them then it is a 5 star set. it is exactly what is advertised to be a set for the hardcore anime watchers. if you like dbz and dont have any of it on dvd i suggest this over the orange bricks. its a bit more expensive but the quality of the set is easy to see
1,Forest Green turned Blue,Ordered and received two Faulkner XL Forest Green recliners and after 2 weeks on the back deck they are now blue and no longer match our patio furniture.
1,not quite there,"This book is just too long. If it were condensed to sub-100 pages it might be worthwhile as it contains some interesting ideas. Unfortunately most of the examples begin with ""Cisco decided to.."", ""At Cisco we..., ""The Cisco method of..."" ......you get the idea. The authors cite ""Good to Great"" which is a real contrast, because the Collins team examines a wide variety of companies and industries rather than simply concentrating on Cisco. The book is also packed with graphics that -- let's face it folks -- are simply meaningless. I do not understand the reason for the other glowing reviews. Mediocre ""at best""."
2,Good for what its worth,I recently went to New York and found it quiet amazing to watch things from Empire State building. It does not have that adjustability but than that is mentioned in the product description. For the price it goes for it is definitely a very good product.
2,Bring the play into your home,"This music is so gorgeous. Surprisingly, it is not as difficult to play as I thought it would be. I don't notice the songs being in different keys than the original, but some of them might be in a key that is a little less difficult to sing than the original. I have noticed a few of the songs I wish were there are not. I was hoping it would have the ""Look Down"" song, but it is not included. Other than that, I have really enjoyed playing the music, and bringing back all the wonderful memories of the play into our home."
2,This is not the time,This is one of my favorite Marvin Sapp songs from many years ago.I wasn't even sure I could find it again but amazon had it.What a blessing! Amazon is my favorite shopping site! I have yet to be disappointed by any of the purchases I ordered from them.
2,The Scientific Trumpeter,"Outstanding accuracy of trumpet playing and unbelievable quality of sound recording/restoring. Here's Lee Morgan in all his splendor. You can hear every single note he's playing with his unusual scientific way. This is truly a rediscovery of mogie. After so many disappointing compilations from that date, this is the real thing: the Vee Jay glorious recordings of February 1960. I cannot get tired from this double. I think that the second cd of alternate takes is an eye opener to the first cd of the master takes. The separation was a wise thing. Mixing the originals with alternates is annoying and disrupting. Both cd's are essential. Meticulous remastering and editing (at a reasonable price) of this small label set a perfect example and a wonderful case study for other whale-sized labels."
1,Subpar,I really needed and expected this product to be stronger and function better. I did a good amount of research on it and it was a sore dissappointment. The shipping was fine but the product bad.
2,"very good, but also violent","This is a good book to read if you are into adventure, and if you don't mind some people dying that you might care about. Since O'Dell died while he was working on the manuscript, you can tell where Elizabeth Hall started writing, if you are familiar with Scott O'Dell's books. Nonetheless, I thought this was a good book for young adults."
2,Really enjoyed Bennie!,"I enjoyed this book a lot, even after seeing the movie, which was also done well. I couldn't put the book down, even though at times it seemed like I'd never be finished with it. A bit long. I really enjoy the way Binchy develops her characters. Definitely will recommend."
1,Not what was expected,Misrepresented - the only original was the Grinch. The other 3 movies were not the originals - very dissappointed.
2,NOT A CLASSIC,but i enjoyed it. THe Doom track is superb. Lyrically i can feel that De La are going downhill but you cant hate them. Legends...Lyrics: 8/10Production: 9/10
1,no thanks,"I am amazed that Rebbecca Ray dropped out of school at the age of 16 to write this novel. I think she has extreme talent, especially for someone of her age. She certainly knows how to create visuals and illustrate her characters. However, the main character was a little cliched, and there was no resolution, it just ends. I found myself slightly bored, and not liking the fact that there were no chapters. Everything just ran together and became jumbled. I will definitely read Rays next novel. It's just that do we really need another coming-of-age story about a 14 year old with some serious issues?"
1,Battery was in bad condition from Amazon,"I have a Back-UPS 1000VA. I use it overseas in South Asia where there are frequent power outages. Batteries usually last about a year or two.I bought one of these on one of my last trips to the States. On the second day of use, I noticed that the battery didn't hold charge properly. It drops from 100% charge to 60% charge in a matter of seconds, then discharges at a normal rate. This should never occur with a new battery. Unfortunately, I don't think Amazon takes returns on batteries, nor is that an option for me from my current location overseas.So just a general FYI and heads up. Buyer beware, there's a chance you could get a faulty battery from Amazon which doesn't hold its charge properly.I have previously purchased my batteries new from Ebay and have never had a problem with any of them."
2,Crayola washables,"Thank goodness they offer all these wonderful colors in the bigger package. 12 ct was required for school. I am so glad that my kids can color with teal and light tan.Great product, and as always, WASHABLE!"
1,"bo, the dog with remarkably poor illustrations","This book is listed as for babies to preschool, but it has little appeal to this age group (or any other). The illustrations are poorly done, unappealing, and not in the least expressive. The text and illustrations are on separate pages, so you can't read while showing the illustration even if you wanted to.The text is poorly written and full of inappropriately big words; there are no illustrations that actually show what is being talked about (no pictures of blood testing, insulin needles, or any other new object the diabetic child will encounter).The text is unappealing and condescending as well. A pre-schooler would be confused by the words and wording; an older child would be repulsed by the condescending attitude and lack of actual information about everyday life for diabetic children.There are a lot of books on diabetes for children on Amazon.com. Look beyond this one. ""Bo"" is much less useful than a simple verbal explanation from a parent."
2,one of my favorite from the 80's!,"I couldn't find my original CD which I thought had survived since the 80's through 4 kids, lots of parties, and 4 moves! I recall a group of us on a girl's night out at the Robert Palmer outdoor concert at the Concord Pavilion; lots of happy memories! I not only had teenaged children in those days, but also employed highschoolers in my ice cream store, and they all loved it also.I wanted to put this music on a memory stick for my new car to enjoy it on a road trip, but I couldn't find it so had to purchase this download for sure. Then the original showed up as we cleaned out the old 14-year old car we sold! This is my favorite of the Palmer music that I own or know about."
2,"Fun, quick and makes you feel better about yourself...","Kennedy's book is an incredibly fast and almost always enjoyable look at growing up X. He is so amusing as he relates the tales of his life. He makes a million mistakes, but can manage to laugh. He seems to have turned out ok. Another in a long line of memoirs from Gen X's, this one is almost up there with Paul Feig's and Dan Zevin (the Day I turned Uncool). The stories are light and will make you feel better about yourself, not matter how sad your life seems."
2,Practical advice from Pro touts Jacks or Better as Best Play,"Best book on Video Poker I have read. All Gamblers mustread the chapter: ""Bride of Bulletman."" Real and hilarious!!"
1,Terrible for my skin,"I used this for two weeks, and then my skin had a break out of tiny bumps, after this reaction my skin was peeling for 3 weeks!!! :("
1,PIECE OF CRAP MONITOR,We hate this monitor. You can't hear the baby for the traffic picking up on it. I wish we had known that prior to spending so much money on this item.
2,Planar Void,I only remember parts of this movie and they were great. I really can't wait to see it again some day. I hope I live that long.
1,Copy of what is already available on the web ...,"-in the first place, it is not ""in depth"" what you will find in this small booklet, but superficial;- in the 2nd place, this material is already presented on the web elsewhere (and free of charge ..)- in the 3rd place, there are a couple of errors in the calculations and formulas.- As well it looks like a ""cut & paste"" product out of the otherbooks from Bruce ...Bottom Line: it is not worth the money"
1,What a Joke!,"I cannot believe that someone can make this type of ""documentary"" (and I use the term loosely, as ""pack of lies"" would be more appropriate), inject it with all kinds of lies and manipulation of facts, and make so much money from it. I have no respect for someone who becomes a millionaire criticizing his own government based on lies but then praises communist countries (Cuba) that deny the very freedom (freedom of speech) that allowed him to become so wealthy. If you must see this movie, PLEASE see ""Fahrenhype 9/11"" right afterwards. That way you will get the REAL story, and you'll get to see all the fabrications that Michael Moore would like you to believe as fact. And in fact, ""Fahrenhype 9/11"" is a lot more interesting than Moore's movie, which most of the time just drags on. Of course, that is when it is not cheaply exploiting the images of our soldiers."
2,Great read,"This book catches your attention right away. Found it hard to put down and one that I could read again. Linda Howard brings people together who, in the usual course of events, would never meet. How they work out their differences and come together to solve challenges keeps you turning pages."
2,LOVE THIS STUFF,"I dont have a severe allergy to peanuts, but they do cause me break out badly, and i get painful cysts on my back that take ages to go away. I gave up on peanut butter altogether about 5 years ago. I was very pleased to finally find an acceptable substitute (Thanks to my wonderful GF!). Alone, honestly, doesn't taste exactly like peanut butter (still, tastes good). But, with grape jelly, oh man, i cant even tell the difference. SB n' J sandwiches are FTW! Great stuff, I love it, thank you for making it IM Healthy! Im going to try their other flavors soon!"
2,The TREO for the road warrior,"The TREO has evolved into a excelent integrated PDA. I bought the 300 and then the 600 and was happy with both given the alternatives. The added Bluetooth feature and the improved screen make the 650 worth the wait. I liked the 600 but with a compatible Bluetooth headset from Jabra I love the 650. I drive about 1000 miles a week, with the 300 and 600, I was constantly getting the seatbelt, tie & headset cord tangled. The wireless headset solves all of that. The improved screen makes e-mail and web browsing easier to use in all environments. I do not load my PDA with secondary apps. or files so I can't speak to the memory issue, however, I do have a database of over 1,100 contacts and have plenty of remaining memory. My only disapointment is that they changed the connector forcing me to buy a new car adaptor and desktop cradle (not yet avaiable) The cradle should have been included or been available when the unit went on sale."
2,Great Cd to relive the past,This is a no brainer...... Music that will flash you back to a time that was crazy and filled with great musicans !!!!
2,Helpful guide for Texans as well as visitors to Texas,"Laurence Parent's ""Official Guide to Texas StateParks"" is a practical and beautiful presentationof the rich variety of public-accessiblelands of Texas. Divided into seven areas, itgives succinct but helpful descriptions of parksin ""Big Bend Country"", ""Gulf Coast"",""Hill Country"", ""Panhandle Plains"",""Piney Woods"", ""Prairies and Lakes"",and ""South Texas Plains"". There are beautifulcolor photographs of most of the parksand just enough history and information towhet your appetite to see it, (but notenough to make you feel you've seen it,so why bother?) I am ordering copies for myTexas grandchildren to present, along witha Texas roadmap and a promise of bothdaytrips (from the Houston area) andcamping trips in the near future. This isa great reference book as well asjust entertaining reading."
2,Breathtaking. That's all I can say.,"For years I monitered the progress of this band. I watched as they grew and changed. They never failed to amaze me. I always wondered what it would be like to hear a grindcore band with true musical and artistic understanding...a band that could play tightly with structure while still capturing the madness of the brand. Jerome's Dream turned out being that band. The ultimate fusion of free jazz, avant-garde and grindcore. This double disc set translates the bands journey. Their rise and fall. Awesome unreleased tracks that prior to this album were very hard to find. I couldn't be more happy with this release. Great idea. Great band. A must have. Five stars hand down. Bravo my friends. Bravo."
2,She Loves to Swing!,"My little girl loved this swing! Mommy and Daddy loved this swing! The only problem with it is we wore it out... it still swings just fine and the light works but the sounds and the mobile don't work any more... when they did work they were great, no annoying sounds to drive a frazzled parent up the wall and the fish mobile really caught my little girls attention (she still likes looking at them... the light is really soothing and not too bright...she almost always fell asleep by the time the sound turned off... we also loved that you were able to turn the swing to go side to side, when she was very little this worked the best for us... all in all a great ""must have"" for us!"
1,A long series made seemingly endless with this book,"I began reading the series better than 6 years ago not knowing it was going to turn into a lifelong pursuit. Lord of Chaos, along with the preceding two books, suddenly began to drag. It's as if Robert Jordan only has 5 books worth of quality writing to put into this series but is under contract to put it into 10.I've been reading Chaos since it was released on paperback (who knows how long ago that has been) and I've yet to finish it. Will I? Probably, but only because I've invested too much time in reading the previous 5 and I'm curious to find out how this whole thing ends.My only hope is that the remaining books pick up the pace somewhat and eliminate a lot of unneccesary bland page filler."
1,Is this against Darwinism?,"Hank seems to misrepresent almost every detail of modern evolution theory. He seems to argue against lamarckian ideas and saltationism. He confuses spontaneous generation with abiogenesis. He attacks fossil finds that have been dismissed by scientists for decades. I wonder if Hank actually read up on his material. He seems to quote mine (searching for quotes that can mean different things in the wrong context). If he is a fair representative of the modern creationist movement, I have no choice but to list it as another cult with crazy fringe ideas. He left the science at home and pumped up the rhetoric. I'm sorry that we Christians have these kind of people speaking for us. I think Hank will have a lot of explaining to do to the Big Guy. Shame on you Hank. You are taking advantage of our current situation of poor science standards and filling minds with falsehoods in exchange. It will catch up to you."
1,"Excruciatingly boring, slow and sloppy","If you are a fan of the great ST works of Diane Carey, Peter David, Michael Jan Friedman. John Vornholt or any of a host of others similar in style, then you're going to hate this book. I read a typical ST novel in a weekend, but it took 3 weeks to read this one. Boring."
1,Sheds Feathers Quickly and is COLD to the Touch!,"I bought this product last winter (2007) because of the many good reviews. I would NOT recommend it for purchase because it loses it's feathers *very* quickly and becomes incapable of trapping warm air. After one season and one washing, I have a very flat product that is 'linty' with feathers.Also, the throw is made of a material that retains the cold temperature of the room around it (unlike a fleece wrap). When you first wrap yourself in it - BE PREPARED FOR THE SHOCK OF HOW COLD THE WRAP ITSELF IS! It can be very unpleasant (like crawling under cold bedsheets in the middle of winter) until your body heat warms the wrap up.The size is good, but this is definitely *not* a product worth $20. The wrap is supposed to keep *you* warm, not you keep *it* warm.O"
1,Umm.... really.,"I'm going to be incredibly blunt, cause that's just the way I am. I'm in HS English 3P, and we're reading Sound of Waves, by Yukio Mishima. The book put me to sleep every time I tried to read it. I was bored out of my mind, and you will be too if you bother with it. Just tell your teacher some *choice advice* and save yourself some problems, okay? DON'T READ IT!!!!"
2,Another Oakie Best,"I recently read an article in the Chicago Tribune about Oakie after he played here a few weeks ago. One thing that stuck out to me was the mention that he tries to create a ""Atmosphere"" when he plays live. I never really thought of his music like that before, but it truely makes sense now. This CD, like all of his others, has some sort of psychological effect on me. It is 2 CD's of pure goodness that makes me want to get up and move, or sit back and relax and enjoy life. Even though he did use some songs from ""Another World"" it really didn't seem to bother me because they fit in so well.You owe it to yourself, even if you're not a fan of trance or techno, to pick this album up. If you're not already a fan, Paul could be your Missionary."
2,"Good BluRay, Good-ish Movie","This is a good movie, good, not great. The Blu Ray transfer is very good, not necessarily reference quality, but worth the upgrade. I understand this movie has taken significant historical liberties, so if you're expect strict historical interpretation (and you actually know the story), you'll probably not enjoy. However, that notwithstanding, its an entertaining movie, but you must enjoy the period depicted. The acting is generally good (I especially enjoy Natalie Portman, but think that Scarlett Johansson is a very highly overrated buffoon), the sets are well done, and the story/dialog is not painful to sit through."
2,This book is a must have reference for everyone who mixes drinks,This book is an extremely valuable resource providing detailed recipes on an extensive number of drinks. Providing multiple versions on many of the more popular recipes is a nice bonus. The product information included by the author is interesting and the straightforward drink preparation instructions are also very valuable and helpful.
1,It sometimes works sometimes,I set one of these up in a conference room as a quick solution because I found it laying around the office. It usually works however sometimes it does not recognize the input and the only way I can get it to recognize signal is by switching to another input. Not my favorite product.
1,it is sooooo slow!!!,"I have this for a long time...I have already written review but I have to do new one, because the cruizer is so slow... and that freaks me out.Everything is just too slow.shame :("
2,a Christmas Carol with Victorian feeling,"Some people prefer the Alistair Sim version of this tale because Sim is a warmer, more sympathetic Scrooge from the start, but if you want a Scrooge who's more like the Ebeneezer we all remember from reading the book, Reginald Owen does a great job. He's a tough, cantankerous old bird, but that makes his transformation at the end all the more touching. Another wonderful feature of this movie is that it was made in the '30s, so there were people at the studio then who remembered Victorian Christmases firsthand, including Owen, who was born in 1887. Regardless of a few details that have been left out for the sake of brevity, this film has a very authentic look and atmosphere, and the script is excellent."
1,Naked Emperors,"Admirers of this glimpse into madness must have a great need to feel smug and superior. Such ""intellectuals"" are painfully desperate and afraid of reality; for it is only in the realm of the naked emperors that they can pretend to be hip."
1,dissapointing,"long, boring, and a plot that is very hard to understand. this movie kept dragging on and on. i just wanted it to end and when it does end we realize we have to sit through a whole new movie cause nothing really ends here. they just leave u hanging there. but this movie wasn't near as close to being as big as everyone expected"
2,Will be perfect,For our new room that will not have a bath but only this will make do! Ha better than nothing!
1,"Marginal, Light Weight Tomahawk Easy to Break","I own the SOG Fusion Tomahawk along with several of the Cold Steel Tomahawks. The SOG Fusion Tomahawk is too light and flimsy. Drilling several holes in the blade of the hawk is a really dumb idea - it lightens the hawk and makes it weaker and easier to bend/break. I don't care for the plastic handle - it is easy to break and has a lousy grip. At a minimum, it needs 550 cord wrapped around the handle as the grooved grip is very uncomfortable. Wood handles are better. If you need a spiked tomahawk, get one of the Cold Steel Vietnam Tomahawks. Of all of my hawks, I like the Cold Steel Rifleman's Hawk the best.I would not use this for combat."
2,End of the story...,"I absolutely love this book. I originally found this book at a library, borrowed it, renewed it at least 4 times, and I bought it so I CAN KEEP IT FOREVER.Amazing book, it's like Playboy magazine or food network magazine for me.. makes my eyes delighted (:"
2,Nice Brush,"This brush is not your basic veggie brush. It fits nicely in my hands and it's rubberized grip is fantastic and non slip. The bristles are softer than many I have used, yet stiff enough to clean the biggest potatos and carrots. Sometimes with my other veggie brush my hand would get cramped. Your probably wondering... ""How many veggies must that guy scrub if his hand gets cramped?"" Well, I scrub lots of veggies- I am a professional scrubber. Anyway, this brush sure gets those vegetables clean."
2,quite jingle jangle troubadour,"good new album from tom petty without heartbreakers.a taste of honey but lyrics not too optimistic about life on the road and music business. the melodies are sublime, a touch of beatles and two touch of dylan, the better dylan. petty is fine observer and tough rocker, the musicof highway companion is a breeze in a hot summer night, his vision of music world is the reflection of a man that has lived all the good and all the bad of the rock n'roll over his skin. Full of maturity, wise and ironic and relaxing too, with great harmonies and airy guitars, highway companion is the best friend of the summer of 2006.MAURO ZAMBELLINI"
2,yay!,"hey erin! i cant believe you posted that, its so awesome! anyway, you should buy this cd...somwhere, cause it rocks"
2,"Don't be afraid, drop it in the water, leave it out in the rain","Full camera functionality in a waterproof case, leave it to Sony. I use it in salt and fresh water, and have regularly bounced it around on the bottom of my kayak. No leaks."
1,Bad,"The phone works fine but the battery is TERRIBLE!!!!!! I would have it fully charged before bed, and before the next morning it would be dead. I would have to charge it 5-6 times a day and who has time to do that. I thought it might just be the one I had so I told Amazon and they sent me another...nope, same exact thing happened, the battery wouldn't last 3 hours (and that's with me not even talking on it). I even tried my old razr battery because it works fine and it did the same thing so it was just those phones. Do not get it, it's a waste of your time!"
1,Interesting book if you want to fall asleep suddenly!,"In the first part of her novel, Zadie Smith manages to create a strong aversion against the drug-addicted protagonist Alex-Li Tandem. The fact, that there was nearly no plot makes it difficult for the reader to concentrate in staying interested in the book.Alex-Li is very creative when it comes to drug-consuming, e.g. when he drinks the alphabet, but most of the time he is just annoying and unable to have a normal relationship with his girlfriend Esther. He is not interested in Esther's illness at all because all that counts for him is Kitty Alexander, an ancient film diva he is the greatest fan of.All the other characters in the book aren't interesting, either.The ordinary reader can't understand all the allusions to the jewish religion, to Buddhism and to movies nobody knows.The end isn't a real end, it's more disappointing than the rest of the novel."
2,My favorite Getz album,"A beautiful album. ""What Do You Want"" is one of my very favorite songs of all time. It's an evocative, melancholy reflection, with a particularly memorable line: ""Sometimes there is just too much ""after' in your afternoon.""Getz is a gifted performer and songwriter who deserves to be widely heard."
1,Not like Sex and Zen,"If you've ever seen good Chinese erotica (Sex and Zen, Erotic Ghost Story, etc), then you might have, like I was, been hoping that this was one of those films.It is not!It is an adult film but I did not enjoy it. Women were 'victims' of male lusts. The only 'power' women had were in scheming behind the scenes against other women.On a technical side too, the subtitles were blurred - maybe you don't watch this film for dialogue, but for me, it helps."
2,Sopranos Complete Series,"When you give in and buy the product that costs around $300.00, you will get the real thing. I have watched every disc and they all work perfect. It is a lot of money, but if you want the real deal and don't want to get ripped off, than this is the version to purchase."
2,Passion fruit puree.,"I was making a wedding cake and the bride wanted passion fruit mousse between the layers.I said no problem. Then I tried to locate passion fruit puree in my area(Sacramento).Couldn't find it. Thank goodness for The Perfect Puree of Napa Valley. The passion fruit puree came frozen, thawed beautifuly,and tasted fantastic.What a great product!"
1,Only the title is memorable,"Had Lou Reed and John Cale not seen a copy of this book in a New York City gutter (fittingly) and decided to use its name for their group, this little volume would have been justly forgotten.Written in a style which titilates while decrying the scene it describes, it's a piece of blue-nosed junk.Listen to Velvet Underground music and forget this silliness."
1,So disappointed,"I really wanted to like these because it seemed like I was getting a good deal on quality headphones. I'm a small person and these headphones were HUGE on me and I read the reviews before purchasing, no mention of size. I was intending to wear these while I work as a studio artist but they are just too bulky to be active with. The cord is coiled and I really wish they would state that in the specs because it makes the headphones even heavier. The sound quality was disappointing as well, I might as well be listening to music through a tin can. No bass. At all. The only thing I really liked about these were the excellent sound isolation."
2,"NIV Holy Bible, Compact","Print is too small for me to read, even with reading glasses. I will probably try to find a larger print edition, and just give this as a gift. Otherwise, great puchase."
1,This book is too small,This book is too small to have any information about astral projection. The information in this book can be found in any book that is around 200 pages.
2,"great tag, great customer service","I ordered a tag for my dog around Christmas time last year. I forgot to include the shape I wanted in the gift tag information, and someone emailed me immediately to ask me to correct it. I agree with other posts that the ""gift tag"" part of the ordering is confusing, but I was happy that they checked with me before just sending me any ol' tag.I liked the tag so much, I ordered another when our address changed."
1,He's Had Better Magazine Articles,"I bought this book at first sight as Charles Barkley is one of my favorite athletes, and one of the best sources of entertaining and memorable quotes/observations in the past 15 years. Sadly, this book was a big disappointment. One wouldn't expect deep thought analysis or high journalism with this book, but instead entertaining commentary and observations that is Charles' trademark to compensate. While the former holds true, the latter is missing. What the reader is ultimately left with is a book that could have been written by any athelete, and you wouldn't be able to differentiate the voice as belonging to Charles. The special quality that makes Charles interesting and unique simply is not present in the book. It pains me to say this as one of his biggest fans, but this book simply isn't the same Charles."
2,An enjoyable read,"I don't know of any other book quite like this one. Amy Stewart really captures the mindset of the beginning gardener with all its joys, mysteries and hardships. Her saga is interwoven with some viable tips which are an additional plus. If you have been hit with the gardening bug, whether you live on the east coast or the west as she does, whether you are into one specific type of plant or eclectic, you will be able to relate to her journey of horticultural discovery. Going to suggest this to members of the local gardening club. A thoughtful, enjoyable and useful book."
2,"Great Townshend, Frampton and Phil Colli hard to find songs!","This cd contains great ""lost"" songs from great artists like Pete Towshend, Phil Collins and Peter Frampton among others. Specially the title song by Peter Townshend is among the best he has recorded. It is a great song."
1,SMELLS TERRIBLE,This ball is probably made of cheap plastic that includes crappy chemicals. It smells sooo bad that it gives me headache. Do not buy it! I am not sure if that odor is healthy to actually breathe.God it is annoying!!!
1,Not what I expected!,"I ordered struts and rear shocks for my 1997 Mercury Villager (both Monroe) but the rear shocks were no where near the same quality as the OEM shocks. The construction seemed to be cheaper and the weight of the new shocks lead me to believe they were cheaply built too. I was amazed to find the OEM (motorcraft) shocks were not leaking, I don't expect the replacements to last 14 years and 135,000 miles. JMO UPDATE: 10-21-2011 the Monroe 32207 on the left rear started leaking oil with only 4,000 miles and 8 months of use. I tried to get Monroe to warranty the poorly made product but had no luck. Amazon came to my rescue and gave me a complete refund....I will be replacing the defective with KYB or OEM."
2,Bakes well!,"I purchased this item and was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the pan. Being a brownie lover, I haven't had a negative experience yet with this product."
2,Loved this book,"This book is really wonderful, but we have found all of Grimassi's book to be this way, it is a little treasure and very imformative"
1,Don't buy this product.,I bought this and I deeply regret it.It is the same as if you had nothing. Don't waste your time and money on this crap.I can not believe that amazon sells such a terrible product. The good reviews that you see is probably from people that are family of the seller.Just hate this thing.
1,Incorrect image,As a British citizen in the USA I was looking for a British Union Flag (It isn't a Union Jack unless it is on a boat) and noticed that the red diagonal St Patrick's cross is missing on the photo. It may be that the flag you receive is different to the displayed photo but buyer beware - this image is not the British flag.
1,HORRIBLE ...,I wanted this monitor because it matched our theme and we had all the Ocean Wonders Items. I thought the light show would be cool and soothing. My son is only two weeks old and I just put him in his room three days ago. Two nights in a row I have no idea how long my son cried before I woke up. I can sleep through anything. When I woke up and looked at the monitor it didn't even register that he was SCREAMING.I returned this monitor yesterday and bought the Safety 1st's Safe Glow 2 Receiver Monitor. It is clear as day and I woke up last night when he started moving instead of after he was screaming.
2,a must have for the collection,"As usual, a burn notice dvd comes out and I get it. Im addicted to the show. I know some people say that every episode is basically the same thing and michael will never become a spy again....but its still one of the most unique shows running."
2,Classics by Trini,Trini Lopez high energy and emotional style shows why these classics have endured forever.These songs will be part of Musical lore for another 60 years.
2,great pots and pans,"These stainless steel pots and pans are great! It is good value for the money. I bought these for my college going son. I did not want to spend as much as Alclad, but still wanted something that would last a while. He loves them. One thing he did mention is that the pot he uses for pasta got rainbow colored spots. I think that perhaps he used very high heat setting. I think that medium heat is all you need to use with this set. Overall, for look, price and performance, I would highly recommend this set."
2,Eva,"Eva Casaidy started singing when her friends draged to to karaoke bars she did not want to go on stage but her friends pushed her,come to find out she had this beautiful voice she or her friend never kney she had, Arecord producer was in one of the bars she had been singing karaoke in and wanted to sighn her to a contract. I believe she made 5-6 cds when she learned she had cancer She lost her battle with it shortly after. I think the world was short changed my faverot songs she did was over the rainbow, songbird, and fields of gold. her parents are now in charge of her records take a listen all proceeds go to help fight cancer.Songbird"
2,A bit more violence in this one,"I adored Shrek and Shrek 2 but am somewhat disappointed with the latest sequel. I watch these with my toddler granddaughter, and she truly gets upset when she sees scenes with some violence. While we adore the 'babies' we have to skip over too many of the 'scary scenes' for her. Perhaps when she gets older she'll enjoy this. To date, our absolute favorite is Shrek 2."
1,RIP OFF,"Not at all as described! Described model has a seat to sit when sled is upright so walls are used as a wind barrier, what came is a different model and sitting is NOT an option so what you get is a sled to pull your fishing gear. We sent it back and was sent the same thing with wrong description!"
2,I don't know what these other people are talking about...,"I have had this pad for a year in my daughter's highchair. It is super cute but better than that, it is so sturdy! I have washed it many times on low to medium cycle and then laid flat to dry and it still looks new and is not even close to splitting! I guess if you threw it in the washing machine on high and fast and tried drying it in the dryer then maybe it would come apart ( like most things ) but if you have common sense then you should have no problem. I have two and am buying another because I love this pattern and have not seen or had anything cuter and better quality! Get it- you will love it, just wash it with a little kindness and it will be fine. Enjoy!!!"
2,Better than I thought,"I can see why this book only got a three star rating because it was confusing, but if you just pay attention to the book it will make sense. This book is about a boy named marco and his mom doesn't wan't him to play sports because she's afraid he'll get hurt. One day he sneaks out and plays softball and gets hurt. He then gets a call from a boy named Keith who says he lives in Marco's basement. I would say this book is one of the most unique books in the goosebumps series. This book in my opinion is still worth reading."
2,Nice but not quite perfect,"This is a very sharp, nice stacked head Dado blade. Just what you would expect from Freud. And, the price for an 8"" blade like this is good. The only complaint that I have is that the outside blades on mine have a microscopically high point, so if I make a two pass Dado, you can see a scored mark in the bottom of the Dado. It is not deep enough to see from the side, so for almost all applications it works fine.Oh yeah, the box is cheap, but hey, your buying the blade and besides it's probably good enough anyway."
2,This book has a table of contents,"I have no idea why people who read e-books always seem to have this problem: I've seen countless reviews of many books whining that this version is impossible to navigate because it has no table of contents, and every time I download the book and press the back button and there the table is. The book opens on the title page, the table of contents is before that just like it is in a real book. So everyone that posts ""No Table of Contents!"" need to take a deep breath and actually look first.That being said the book is great. The intro is a bit wordy for my taste. Intros should help summarise and give context to the work they're introducing and this one seems almost like a book itself. But hey, it's free so 5 stars!"
1,New Age Translation,"Disappointing Taoist Buddhist Interpolation.This is Stephen Mitchell's Psalms inspired by David.that is ok, but lets be clear about it.Mitchell's trans of Rilke are superb, a god-send."
2,ice danger,"I got this not knowing about Shacketon or his ship or his crew. I got it as a need for a good arctic adventure and history of the men who dared to brave the ice, it was hard to pick between the different accounts, but I'm pleased with this one, I got what I needed out of it, and it was well written by Mr. Worsley"
2,EASILY THE GREATEST BAND IN THE WORLD,"Well not many people will deny about the fact about the greatness of the Beatles.They produced some of the finest music ever written had one of the most succesful careers ever.Rubber soul is fantastic,buy it."
2,Great reliablity,This is a very good reliable phone with talking caller id. It Reliable but the batterys are short lived if you leave it off the cradle more than 24 hours.
2,One of Eddie's Toppers,I really enjoyed this movie again. After having viewed it several times in the passed I decided that it must be in my collection. Charlton Francisco
2,Berger Model# 54-300OP Review,"This instrument is a great value for the bucks...the OP of course, stands for optical plummet, which as any user can attest, is far superior to a plumb bob when it comes to setting up the instrument. The three leveling screws make it easy to set up, too. This instrument also comes with stadia lines, which can save time when doing rough distance checks, especially if you are by yourself! This is a good heavy duty instrument that can take some abuse and keep on performing."
1,"Revisionist History, Populist Pap","The good: It's easy to read. The bad: It's pure revisionist historical pap.The concept of objectivity in historical writing is completely lost on Zinn. Some might find this intertaining, others maddening, yet others still infuriating. The more of this work I read, the less substance I detect. It's junk history, insubstantial, largely fact-less, with no objectivity, basically, a liberal-leaning revisionist perspective of the last few hundred years. Skip it."
2,Garmin nuvi 360,"User friendly. Easy to use right out of the box. We have unit in a cupholder on console of our vehicle and it finds satellites in no time at all. Linked to my bluetooth phone easily and brings up all info from my phone for hands free operation. When it finds a location for you like a store or whatever it displays the phone number and you just touch screen it and it dials that location for you hands free.Yesterday we were in an city area near Tampa, Florida we were not familiar with and we looked at a map of how to return to the interstate. I then touched ""Home"" on the Garmin and it lead us down the shortest, most direct route to the interstate from our location. With our map we would have never picked that route, but it was the best route.Unit announces streets by name, a very good feature you do not get on cheaper models.An amazing piece of technolegy, I would recommend to all travelers."
2,my fave from them,this album for me is there best.very strong flow and very solid arrangements.for me there most complete effort.
1,DON'T BE FOOLED!,"They call it ""200mg"" but in reality it is only 16mg of Resveratrol.This is very misleading.If they are willing to be misleading on their webpage and label, I would wonder about their quality control and contents as well.I won't trust them again."
2,AT LAST!!!,"I've been waiting for years for this to come out in DVD. I bought a worn out VHS copy on EBay several years ago and watched it once, but the quality was sooo bad. To see my absolute favorite Disney movie again will be great!"
1,1 star out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A ridiculous (and ridiculously-bad) horror film rife with plot holes, poor characterization, and ludicrous scenes, The Brood represents Cronenberg at his absolute worst; really pretty terrible, this is a film recommended to no one except people who want insight inside the Canadian horror master's twisted psyche."
2,8-Quart Spaghetti Steamer Cooker,It is all I expected and we have used it for pasta and Cha Su Boa. The only problem is it has left a stain on the bottom pot. that looks like rusting but is not.
2,"bad,really bad","This is a story about 3 kids that have the werst of luck finding some one to keep them. First their parents die,then their house burns down, and so now they need somewere to live right, they probably wish they were homeless after there adventure they go on. Many good things happened in this book and many bad things happened in this book. Read all 13 books and you will find out if they find their perfect home."
2,Gorgeous,"Since I can see that already 1,018 people have reveiwed She's Come Undone, I can think of nothing to do but rehash the words of others, whose reviews I've not even read so I cannot really know what I'll be repeating and what if anything (unlikely) will be original. But I loved this book. It has to be my favorite of all I've read, and that's saying something, because after a while they just don't impress me anymore. Sadly, I can't even say exactly why I enjoyed She's Come Undone so much. Something in it just deeply appealed to me. I loved the unflinching portraits of life and the three dimensional characters. It had it's rough spots, to be sure, but none come to mind at the moment."
2,Wayne Dyer shines again,"This book is another brilliant work from one of the brightest modern thinkers in psychology, philosophy, and religion. In Dyer's characteristic easy-to-read style, he shows how each and every person can tap into the unlimited source of creative intention and create the kind of personal reality we want. One of his greatest lines (borrowed from modern quantum physics) is: ""Change the way you look at things and the things you look at change."" This is truely a fabulous read for all those on the path to personal growth and self actualization."
2,best cd ever,excellent condition of the cd the case wasn't the best but I only wanted teh cd I had previously lost my cd and glad to have anohter one
2,One Problem,"The can opener replaced a Swing Away Can Opener we had for many years. The design was improved over our last one, however; while it hadslot to install a magnet the new opener was delivered without a magnet. .The magnet is supposed to hold the can top after the can is opened.Jack Bleich"
2,very useful lids,"These lids make it a whole lot easier for my family to know which jars they can use. Especially with refrigerator pickles as I can with the regular 2 part lids and once it is opened use these white plastic ones. That way the kids don't end up opening 4 jars of the same and saying ""but I thought it was opened already""!"
1,not very great,"This movie was OK, but a definite letdown-I was expecting more from the special effects. I do agree, however, about the unseen spiritual realm, good and evil, that is constantly surrounding all of us, and quite often, the evil influences win out, because they're so clever; they know how to appeal to people's vanity and selfishness. I know, I used to be easily persuaded to lean toward the vain & selfish. Thankfully, the Lord Jesus blows all of that away when He shines His light in our hearts! Praise God!"
2,14 year old dog just keeps on going....Thanks to Zuke's!!!,"I just can't say enough about this product. A friend recommended this product for my (then) ten year old pug and, within a week, Eleanor was moving about more easily and tugging at the leash to go for her walk.Thank you, Zuke's, for making a great product that really does what it says it will! I encourage any dog owner to give it a try, particularly before medicating with traditional prescriptions from the vet, which can be so caustic to their systems."
1,"Boxy and unflattering fit, uncomfortable",This was on my wish list but unfortunately it fits very boxy around the entire body and is uncomfortably tight around the arms.
1,Total ... ...,"I've owned this book for about 10 minutes now. I can honestly say that everything that they put in versions 1-3 could have been sumerised MUCH better than the [stuff] that they put in here. If you want better info might I suggest that you do a little bit of google searching for vulnerabilities. You'll get more up to date information, and save yourself [$$$]. I am so [mad] that they could have [put] out such a [bad] peice of literature. You're basically buying the video CD, which ... . The SQL section alone is about 8 months old, and any ISO should know this info already. If you're just starting out, I suggest the 3rd edition. More detailed, and less ... . I hate that I had to write such a bad review of such and anticipated book, but I feel I was forced to."
1,read another of Michaels' books instead,"Barbara Michaels usually writes wonderful Gothic romances with great plot twists, wonderful characters and witty dialogue. You won't find any of that here. I had to force myself to finish this dreadful book.The ""heroine"" is actually the plain-looking and plain-spoken sister Jane. The governess who you think will be the heroine is a pretty idiot who can't see the obvious flaws in the man she works so hard to entrap. Except for Jane and a few workmen, every character in this book is so boorish, selfish or sociopathic that you don't care what happens to them.Forget this book. Read instead Michaels' clever ""Stitches in Time"" or her even better ""Wait for What Will Come."" They're both so excellent you'll mourn when you come to the last page."
1,vintage Willie.,"Some of the better Willie recordings. He does seem to ""fudge"" a little bit on pitch, which is not a fatal problem."
2,US Air Force Flag,"I've had this flag a couple of months and am happy with it. It's seen around 2,500 miles and half of that has been in heavy winds. It seems to be a durable flag with good stitching that is holding up quite well. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that the color doesn't wear evenly. Outside of that I am very happy with this flag."
2,"Kong, the Miniseries","They should have just made this a miniseries and then they would have been able to have more side stories and characters that they seemed to want. BUT, they put it all in one movie. Overall, good movie, there are some tense moments (dinosaur chase, bug attack)..and it all reminded me of Jurrassic Park. King Kong was animated really well, but everything else was kind of wierd looking and you could tell it was green screen behind them (but I guess that's what they were looking for). You may find yourself forwarding most scenes just to get through this without going crazy. Recommend - - but forward through slow parts."
1,What happened to John Grisham?,"B-o-r-i-n-g! ""The Testament"" has a thin plot that loses the readers interest after the first few chapters. I bought this book on the strength of readers reviews and was very disappointed--no suspense, no tension."
1,Don't Believe The Hype !,"On the surface there were a couple of amusing moments but this was a depressingly cliched and formualic piece of fiction . What really disappointed me was the lack of rythmn vibrancy and energy in the novel ,the author never fully caputuring the mood and atmosphere of a busy Fashion House . At best this was a stilted memoir of a Fashion Intern desperate to be something more . None of the characters are fully explored and there are weaknesses in plot structure and narrative . An endless array of mind numbing vacuosity none of which is glossed with salacious gossip or anything you can chew on . Another piece of mediocrity falling victim to its own hype ."
1,My son had no interest in this,"It's an ok designed toy with flaps for doors & windows on the cars that a child can lift up. However, it makes no noise (no rattle even) and my bigger hangup is the wheels. The wheels are colored like a black & white target, so when you roll the car it doesn't look like it's spinning. There should be spokes so you can actually see the wheels moving which would engage a child more. I don't think they are machine washable either, only spot clean (which I don't enjoy). My son got these as a gift when he was a few mos old and didn't play with them. He is now just over a year old & he STILL has no interest in them."
2,Great Movie,I have this on TiVo right now and seem to watch it several times a week. I just can't get enough of this movie. What I'm disappointed about is I cannot find a soundtrack.
1,Don't Buy This Game!,This was such a disappointment! It seemed like the dvd was on a loop of the same 10 videos. The questions on the cards were fun and diverse but it is really a shame the dvd portion was lacking.
2,over-hyped but good,"pick it up. its a good single, if you like albarn then you will love this. what have you got to lose, other then a few bucks? who cares anyway. check out the site its fun, especially the mixer thing."
1,So predictable and very insulting,"Please save your money it is not worth purchasing. This movie was an embarrassment to feminists and lesbians alike, and to think this movie was suppose to be from the same producers and writers who made But I'm a Cheerleader and swore this was better writing than that movie were telling a bad joke. It does though have cameos from a few of the actors from But I'm a Cheerleader, nonetheless, this movie was nothing-if not less funny. Not to mention it insulted my intelligence."
2,Good Stories for long car trips,We laughed out loud quite a lot listening to the stories from this village in USA. The stories were nice clean stories suitable for the whole family.
2,Sata cable,Works like a charm and ended several weeks of headaches and searching local stores and getting no where. Easily installed. definitly recommend
2,A Cowboy Vamp...What's not to love??,"This book had all the components of a great story. The sexy hero, the beautiful heroine, the friendly ghost, the dastardly villain...and all were put to good use in this book. I love the way the hero and heroine had to learn to trust each other, and work together, to battle the evil that stalked them. Even the fight scenes were great, and I'm not a fan of violence. If this is an example of Angela Knight's talent, call me a forever fan!"
1,Shame on you Tom,"What a disappointment. I was left wondering who wrote this book for Tom. Since his last book, Tom has discovered the ""F"" word and use of it (a lot) adds absolutely nothing to the story. Tom Clancy on the cover used to be reason enough to put money on the counter. I shall wait for the reviews on his next one.Move forward Tom. Have a new person be a player with President Ryan. Then let the man leave office, retire and go away. Please, no more looking back."
2,Guide to North American Steam Locomotives,"Guide to North American Steam Locomotives is a must for RAIL FANS & Model Railroaders alike. A book like this does not come along often enough. It is an ideal size for taking to Rail Museums & traveling. I would like a larger version for model railroading for home, with larger photos.The book is well written with so much information packed into it small size. The images are clear showing good detail.I highly recommend this book. You really should have one! You will not be disappointed!"
2,Great Classic,"With all due respect to Marni Nixon who did a great job dubbing Audrey Hepburn's singing in the movie version, there is nothing (NOTHING!) like the original stage version with Julie Andrews. This is a great classic."
2,"Gut wrenching, but awesome!","Sure, as with any movie, it starts off validating the main characters and their personalities. But once the Perfect Storm begins, the action is non-stop. I was on the edge of my seat and squealing out loud in the theater. A few times my legs went flying in the air from the excitement and unexpected moments. Even though I was horrified and disappointed about the ending, it was based on a true story. I am now more reverent and frightened of the ocean than ever before. I loved this movie. I came out of it with my heart and gut up in my mouth."
1,This translator sucks,"I think this translator sucks, you can not enter a sentence to be translated .. only single words work best and then it gives you a few options of translations for that certain word . For 100 dollars i would have expected more, along with the word availability is very limited, which means many words are not in it.i bought this so when i travel to China, it was little help"
2,"Wonderful, rare songs by Dolly!","This CD has a wonderful assortment of some songs of Dolly's that are hard to find on her CD's, so this is a great additon to a Dolly collection. Note: Additional Track #16 The Way I See You."
1,Life Extension Bone Restore,"I was not too pleased with this product. I didn't realize I had to take 5 tablets/day. It didn't seem to do muchfor my bone density, calcium intake or osteoarthritis. I probably will not order again."
1,awful in every regard,"pretty harsh review, but true. after two meals, this baby goes back. primary problem - it is a FAST cooker that KEEPS cooking! there is no controlling cooking time / temperature. it's either 4 hours, 6 hours (""fast"") or 8 hours, 10 hours (""slow""). I started a dish to be finished in 8 hours and it started boiling after 1.5 hours and continued at a full boil for the remaining 6.5 hours. it just cooks and cooks and cooks. other points: (1) the lid does not fit. it's not even the same shape as the cooker. it wobbles in place. (2) every now and then you hear a ""pop"" as though the lid were exploding. (3) the footprint is HUGE. Being new to crockpots, I hope to find something that truly slow cooks."
1,"Amazon is STUPID, and this seller is unscrupulous.","I complained to Amazon after paying full price for an an item from this dealer and the dealer renegging on the contract. Yet Amazon wants a review.OK--here it is--AMAZON is stupid, doesn't realize that the buyer renegged on the contract, is not aware I filed a complaint and wants a review!! Amazon is so seller oriented that the buyer is without redress.The buyer has engaged in this conduct before. They list something, find out it is worth more than they ask, then say--item is not available--an error in inventory.Amazaon did not research my complaint."
1,Short story; long book; insurance guy playing tough.,"I swore off Clancy after Patriot Games. Too many words, thinly-drawn characters, language out of the '50s movies he grew up on.(I grew up on them, too; does anyone actually use the word ""pal"" anymore?) But I made the mistake of buying this one. It's based on an interesting idea (with one interesting character -- the Russian), but Clancy has no sense of character, so he just writes and writes and pages pile up and nothing happens and you don't really care about anybody. It must be the Stephen King syndrome. The author has become so commercially successful, nobody can edit him.Be warned. This one ain't worth the effort. And if I ever buy another Clancy book, I hope my wife kicks me right in the butt.For much better writing, try LeCarre for espionage and Stephen Hunter for paramilitary."
1,Like Every Other Record From The Teen Pop Scene,"It's your average CD. The type of music you hear from every generic pop act these days. You don't think about the songs after hearing them. I always measure a great record by the impression the music leaves on me afterwards. If I suddenly catch myself singing it in my head where ever I am, or thinking about the lyrics and the meaning behind them, then I know the album is having an effect on me. Not in this case, however. It's just there."
2,Three,"No Doubt! This book has to be one of the best well written novels of this century. What a plot! What a plot twist! This book grabs you from the beginning, and keeps you holding on till the last page. Is there a dull moment? NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! It begins about a young minster who recieves a anyomous cell phone call from this guy Slater. Stating that he has 3 mintues to confess his sin, or he will blow up the car. Soon chaos urupts in his city. Does he know himself. Does he know who his real friends are. This is a complete Black and White novel. Buy it!"
1,They're not good at all,These are the worst banana chips I've had. They were very greasy and loaded with calories and a bad flavor to them except for the grease.The quality of them were not close to the great quality that I have found in others.
1,Doesn't work with Coolpix 8500!,"Even after assurances by Hitachi technicians that they had tested this microdrive with my camera AND receiving a second, replacement, it DOES NOT work with the 8500. What a wonderful concept - to get 4GB of storage for just a little more than the price of a 2GB flash card. Too bad it doesn't work as advertised!"
2,Most personal insight on Eva Peron I've ever read.,"Of all the books I've read on Eva, this has to be my favorite. I was glad to see a more personal side of Eva, to read her own thoughts. It was intriguing to read more about Eva's personal life and feelings (i.e. towards her husband) rather than the deeds she did, which I feel most people are already aware of. No matter how well the authors of other books ""knew"" Eva, there will always be a certain something lacking. No one will ever know Evita as well as she knew herself. Therefore, I recommend this book to anyone searching for a more personal side of Eva Peron: Spiritual Leader of the Nation (Argentina)."
2,Fabulous!,I am a Kindergarten teacher and this story CD has been a rest time favorite ever since I purchased it. The music is relaxing and a wonderful introduction to classical music and how music can create a feeling and mood. The story is so intriguing and the voices for the characters are contagious. My students often immitate the big toad.
1,Disappointed,"I don't care how you color it, this book is no way like Fifty Shades of Grey. I read the first two chapters and put it away. There is no romance or love associated with this story. It does not have any value to the reader, unless you just like to be sadistically spanked."
2,Last Chance is a great find!,"You'll enjoy this good story that has it all! Be sure to first read its prequel, After All by Jill Marie LandisYou won't be disappointed!"
1,if you wanna waste your time here you go,Lame. Want a real Sterling book read Schismatrix. That book required momumental thought and effort to write. This requires rewrites.
2,Nikki's final album may be his best,"On the edge of turning 50, Nikki Sudden gathers strength from the past and looks into the future with what turned out to be his final album. It's a great mixture of his idols - Bob Dylan, T. Rex, the Stones, the Faces - but he's not aping his heroes so much as he's distilling them down to a fine wine and offering it to us to drink. Folk, glam and even some disco add spice to the good ol' rock & roll that's always been Sudden's stock in trade. This is the album to which his entire career had been leading, and it's a thrice-cursed tragedy that it was his last."
2,Very intelligent,"Very intelligent track order as well as selection (you get all the jewels with one exception of Us and Them). Very intelligent, relaxed filming that allows you to feel like you are there rather than watching another fast-cuts nonsense. Very intelligent stage decor.Your perfect gig. Roger Waters."
2,"Brilliant Cast, Excellent Show","Having had the chance to actually work on this show makes, with the original cast, me a little biased, but I think my perspective on the soundtrack is also interesting. I would have to say working with this cast under the direction of Graciela Daniele was brilliant, everyone contributes so much to their roll and it was a real ensemble piece. Personal standouts for me were Donna Murphy, even in rehearsal, she had this uncanny presence, that her role as the whore underplayed. The trickiest scene in the whole play was Scene 8 we went thru at least 200, but the cast really persevered. Another favorite of mine is Michelle Pawk, she was like a chameleon and when she hit those notes in Mistress of the Senator I just about feinted. Hello Again does grow on you, and I enjoy listening to it and reliving that wonderful experience over and over again."
1,A Disappointment...,"The book is geared towards those with a basic understanding of the Russian alphabet and pronunciation in order to use it. If you have no understanding of the Russian language, do not buy this book. I suggest you sign up for a language class or a more comprehensive Berlitz course. This book is not for amateurs even though it is written in a very simple and concise format."
2,works great !,"We have three dogs, and had bad water stains in onearea from drinking water and drooling, and another areawith heavy traffic dirt stains. Cleaned both areas verynicely ! Quite a work out too !"
2,Cult classic,I've loved this movie since the first time that I saw it. I just purchased the second one and hope that it lives up to the first one!
1,Very bad....,"I have been working with this book, I have seen that most of the code samples included are incorrect. I have noticed serious mistakes, as a result, users should not expect any code samples to even compile, those that do, will show different results than expected."
2,Boyfriend was Happy,Thank you for the prompt service and answering my concern so quickly. My boyfriend was so excited since this was a hard movie to find. Thank you so much
1,"Like my editor used to say, ""it's pretty good""","Where to start? I love the Sanibel/Doc Ford stories. I love Sanibel. I go back there every year. This land-locked Floridian wallows in Florida myth, legend and just stories about redneck cow chasers, crooks, all things water and any story by Randy White. BUT, I was confused a lot by this story. It just seemed a bit of a rip off. It just didn't seem honest somehow and I don't even know if that makes sense. Maybe, it isn't honesty, maybe it was pressure to get another novel done, maybe it's an honest effort to do something different (God knows, I get that)but it hopped all over and just wasn't, well, coherent most of the time. I still await the next no matter what. I trust."
2,Useful accessory for anyone's closet.,Useful accessory for anyone's closet. It very reasonable and I am using it for at least 10 belts ; it stays on your closet rack and you are good to go!
1,Wish I hadn't wasted my money!,"This is one time I wish I hadn't listened to the other reviewers. I didn't find this book at all informative. It could be slightly entertaining at times but it is not at all educational. I had thought this was to give tips and specific instruction on kissing. I thought that this was meant to help improve ones kissing ability. It is kind of childish and it is not beneficial. It talks about kisses in general terms. It even talks about ""butterfly"" and ""eskimo"" kisses which is something that 5 year-old children utilize. I am not 5 years-old and I want some specific adult help to become a fantastic kisser. I don't know what else to offer as a substitute to this stupid book other than practice, practice, practice."
1,Disappointed,"Considering the decent packaging this CD arrived in, I was disappointed to open it and find the CD completely smashed..."
2,Great Show,We bought all these so our daughter could watch them and she loves them. It's a lot better than some things on TV now.
1,Sadistic Fiction,"My sympathy goes to this lady for her burns and mental agony. Having said that, being a victim of violence does not give her a license to defame a society and create lies. Such brutality is rampant in the U.S. and in other ""developed countries"".This is could be a very long article, but I just want to make the point of refuting some of the ""facts"" in this book:http://www.antiwar.com/orig/ttaylor.php?articleid=5801"
2,Great product,"Few products match the stay-in-place power of Always Ultra-thin with wings, but this product does the trick and of course is better for you and the environment! I will order again as soon as my huge case is used up :) Not quite as thin as Always, but great absorption and stay-power."
2,satisfies HUNGER!,"Being a tightly controlled type 1 diabetic for over 30 yrs., I'm always looking for SMART foods that will NOT raise my blood sugars to high. Dr. Kracker is the brand that works the best! This variety contains luscious seeds so is full of Omega 3's & 6's! Also it is higher in protein than your ""normal"" cracker. SEEDLANDER contains low sodium, (190 mg) whole grain flour, (complex carbs)and virtually NO sugar! (2gm per serving) This is all combined with a VERY healthy 100 calories per a 3.5"" x 5"" serving. It is the absolute BEST tasting cracker EVER! I've also found AMAZON to be the ONLY place that offers DR. KRACKER for purchase after Costco discontinued it, at such an AWESOME price!Doctor Kracker Flatbread, Organic and Artisan Baked Klassic 3 Seed, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)"
1,Not worth my money,"For a best selling author I was hoping for something better then this. It is the first time I've read a book by Orson Scott Card, and was incredibly disappointed by the writing. Especially the lack of detail. I'm struggling to finish it, the story doesn't hold my attention or interest.I realize it's a story being told to someone else - but a great storyteller will SHOW me not TELL me what is going on. More detail could make it a much better read, captivating, instead of a barebones sketch of what is happening.I'll be returning this book unfinished, and I'll forget the bland writing. It isn't worth my money or for me to remember it."
2,Midnight Oil Ignites the Fire,"The very energetic debut by the Aussie rockers starts off with a bang with the explosive ""Powderworks"", a song that would be given a much more vigorous workout on the live album Scream in Blue Live. Still, this song in particular shows off the band's Who-influenced surf punk. ""Nothing Lost, Nothing Gained"" closes the album as a slow bluesy piece with an absolutely scorching pair of Martin Rotsey solos. Most of what's in between isn't as strong as these two bookend numbers, but the energy the band brings to each number outweigh any technical flaws that might be present in their playing. The fact that Midnight Oil would emerge a year later with the dynamite Head Injuries only shows how quickly their musical skills would grow, a trend that would continue into the 90s as each album would prove to be a musical leap from the previous one. Not the best Midnight Oil album, but still a strong debut."
2,Great Work,"If it werent for the spice girls, Melanie C wouldnt have had so much success with this album. I must admit, its not my type of music, but I support her greatfully and shes still a spice girl! She did not quit, but I wanna say congrats for a great CD!"
2,It's a winner,"We bought this movie for our son who was turning 3 and it is definitely his favorite movie! He doesn't sit still for much, so it says a lot that he wants to watch this over and over. We are very pleased with it, and have enjoyed watching it ourselves!"
1,Poor Design,The plastic edge of this thing is too high so slight pressure on the sponge pushes it down and all you get is plastic on leather. Took forever to shine up one pair of shoes and had to get rid of it.
2,Jennifer is keeping it real.,"I love the remix! It's got a cool slow vibe, and I like Ja Rule's singing. Jennifer and Ja Rule made one heck of a collaboration. The way they sing, the way the music flows and so on, cause it's real! AND I CAN'T GO ON WITHOUT THIS SONG!"
2,"Not your usual FIRM workout, but still very good","I am sort of a workout junkie, to be more specific, a ""FIRM"" workout junkie. I like how intense the FIRM is, and I sort of look for that in the workouts that I do. Now this workout is good, not as intense as the TransFIRMer workouts that were just out. Don't get me wrong: I have the 6lb ball, and you use it for 90% of the workout. At the end, I was definately ready to put it down, so it did work me out.Pros: Different change of pace using the ball; lots of moves that strengthen your core; a fun and different stretch at the end using the ball; Tina Smalley is a precise leader that is easy to follow.Cons: I miss the old FIRM master instructors that were in all the other videos. Just Allie and Allison were in this one. They didn't even introduce the others. There was no changes in weight, which used to be the way to spot an ""ineffective workout"" according to the ""old"" FIRM tapes. And lastly, In my humble opinion, the ball is a little gimicky."
1,This CD bites the big one!,"I really despise every song on this CD. Adam Duritz is a raving megalomanical moron who wants to deafen us all with his incessant whining. And his hair is bad too. Mr. Jones and me is a perfect example. Gotta love that wonderful melodious music that induces bloody ears. Thanks for your time, Grand Iconoclast Otaku ""2"""
1,Stink-o-rama,"This toy is not at all what it seems to be, doesn't work well, and isn't fun. My son played with it for about ten minutes. Once he realized how NOT fun it was, he put it in his room. It has been in his drawer since Christmas.I don't know who the people are who are giving this toy a positive review. They must have stock in the company or something. For the rest of us, this toy is stink-o-rama."
2,what i expected,these jeans were what i expected in terms of look and fit. no surprises. classic 501's. i do agree with other reviewers that the fabric seems a bit thinner or less stout than i recall from years ago
1,jailhouse rock colorized?,well it dont say it has a colorized verion on it so ill wait till they do.
1,Not for small keys,I needed something to use on keys slightly smaller than a door key. These would not hold my keys at all.
1,The worst move ever made!,If there was a rating of less than 1 star- or actually negative number of stars- this movie is worthy. A friend claimed they had seen the worst movie ever made- Jason X- but I assured him I could top it!! I was glad the movie was so cheap when I looked it up so I could prove my point. I'd have never spent $10 or more on it. There is no part of this move I didn't hate. But if horrible movies are you thing this is the one for you!
1,not what i asked for,i went to a site looking for a portable dvd player w/screen and i found one at a fantastic price so i paid for it . when i lokked at data for it a home dvd player came up and now i am having trouble getting ahold of the person who sold it to my via amazon.com....pretty bogus if you ask me. this is the first time i have bought something over the web..maybe i am stupid but i did everything that amazon told me to do.it was an initial portable dvd player w/screen model sd 1700. toshiba sd1700 home dvd player was sent to me.
1,A lot of boredom and bigotry,"First, let me say this movie had all the potential for being great - great actresses and a unique story (or rather stories). However, it went on and on and then on some more. Where was the editing???? Speaking of editing, they could have left out the digs on Republicans (hello.....at least 45% of the nation!!) and the fake Texas accents would be funny if not done surely in poor taste. I guess it's ok to be a bigot if the targeted group is either Southern in nature or Republican. Julie Powell and the entire writing team of this movie, you should be ashamed!!!!Kristine Alford, Texas"
2,Love and Respect,Received the book in a timely fashion in excellent condition. It is a very good book for couples.
1,waterlogged carpet results,"I had to hire professional carpet cleaners to get rid of the brown spots left by this cleaner. It get's rid of the original stain just fine, but it doesn't suck up the water properly...it took three days for the carpet to dry and left a big round brown spot on the carpet. Unless you have a way to dry out your carpets faster, I don't suggest buying this product as the water damage to the carpets looks just as bad as the original stain...if not worse,"
2,"Love,love,love,love,love,love,love,love Waiting For A Girl Like You",Love is what I need and Waiting For A Girl Like You is what I listen to.This lovely ballad deserves way more than 5 stars because it is so beautiful and lovely and is better than any ballad by Bon Jovi or Scorpions wich their ballads make me cry compared to Waiting For A Girl Like You. Waiting For A Girl Like You always makes me happy and always and I think Lou Gramm should be honoured for being such a wonderful rock singer who is just as talented as Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day. Avoid the 1 star reviewers below and avoid all albums from super boring bands like Pink Floyd who suck heavy time.
1,Do Not Purchase this Item or the LUX LV1,"Ok, I would have to agree with the other reviews that have had problems with this item, if only i had read the reviews before purchasing two of these items then i wouldnt be trying to return them right now, afetr installing these thermostats i noticed that with the room tempreature being 73 degrees these thermostats would not turn off untill i turned them down to around 55 degrees, that gives it around a 17 degree difference. so if you want an acurate thermostat do not buy this item, put out some extra cash and purchse the LUX ELV4 programmable line heating thermostat, i now have two of these units and they are the best, they have a digital thermometer built into them so there is no need to worry about checking your heating system after programming these devices, your room will be nice and warm when you wake up and will turn off when you want it too."
1,"If you like AM and Being There, beware of Summer Teeth","When I first listened to this album, I wondered ""What Happened?!"". A recent reviewer was absolutely on the money when he/she said this album was overproduced. I also agree that the synthesizer was overly annoying at times. After this album I wrote Wilco off, which is a shame. It took me a long time to even listen to Yankee Foxtrot Hotel (which I like, but think the hype outpaced its true significance). In the end, if you like Tweedy's cheesy lyricism and can get by a horrid bubble gum pop veneer, you might try Summer Teeth. If, like me, you value the music more, avoid this one unless you are a collector."
1,Megasucks!!,This CD was Megadeth's attempt at superstardom and it is a pretty weak and lame attempt. The songs are almost pop-rock sounding. There are so many repeated choruses throughout and there aren't really any heavy songs on here in what used to be the traditional Megadeth style. It is and probably will always be my least favorite Megadeth CD. Only buy this one if you are a diehard fan.
1,Bad As They Were,"Unlike most of the reviewers here, I got to meet some of the guys here either in concert, from the 'hood etc. All left a bad impression on me, so to see them so marvelously pictured here is confusing."
2,Feels Greasy,"I was looking for a mustache wax and I thought I'd try this but it is not what I expected. It feels more greasy then waxy. Now I'm no expert in this stuff, but I find it works better as a lip balm then a mustache wax, so that's why I give it a 4."
1,PC and deprecating,"A conscientious survey obviously based on committed and extensive study, but marred throughout by the author's predilection for the politically correct and the related deprecation of her own culture and society, and by an apparent absence of direct personal experience in her chosen subject."
2,Wisdom 365 Thoughts from Indian Masters,"Thank you so much for getting me the book so quickly. As it turned out I will be buying an additional copy. A friend saw it on my table and loved it so much, with her birthday in a few days (I had no idea what to get her before) I gave her the book :-)Love and Grace"
1,Too Thin and Too Long,"Using one dimensional stick figures on a special effects ship, Cameron continues to tell a story about one dimensional people. A far superior product,""A Night to Remember"" (in black and white), is available at your local video shop. Much shorter, better action and is historically more accurate. It is a bit dated due to its age but is certainly more interesting than Cameron's version. END"
2,Sexy sounding opera recording with Battle & Horne !!!!,"L'Italiana in Algeri is a hot & fun opera.....The duets and the ensembles are especially giddy and full of lustful yet comic high speeding word to word leaps and soaring runabouts.And there are some lovely arias here to.Just listen to Kathleen Battle spin golden melodies by herself at intervals through out the opera.Kathleen Battle is one beautiful black woman & she possess a voice to match,She sings rossini like she was born to do it ,the way she does it melts your icecream & has you standing up to give her your last arcane box of accolades & praiseworthies....I'll tell you this recording is one of the best out there,and should be in every library and tasteful home."
2,Phenomenal first CD!,"If you're anything like me, you love to discover great young bands with sounds that are familiar and yet elusive. Look no further. No Other Comfort would be a brilliant effort by many established bands with its highly polished content melodic and layered. Their sound is dreamy and yearning, yet in a way that is entirely their own and never spirals down into shoegazing self-indulgence. They'll remind you of a million bands- Siouxsie, The Cure, etc- and their singer sounds a lot like Maria McKee, but this is a band that is never derivative on this CD. Buy this and support a young band that deserves support!"
2,If you can't make it to Mongolia this season....,"Mykel Board -- punk rocker, New Yorker, gonzo provocateur -- fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to Mongolia for one year to teach English...and I'm so glad he did. His easy-to-read writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny, from his problems overcoming constipation (because Metamucil is not sold in Outer Mongolia, Board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea), to his visits to Mongolian dance clubs, to the confusing hurdles presented in this post-Soviet limbo land (""Welcome to Mongolia!"" is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention). Unlike most travel memoirs, there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture -- even though there were times that I, a fellow traveler, longed for Mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country -- making this book a fun, unrestrained ride through a remote, Kafka-esque kingdom. Buy this book."
1,Prince of the Pastry Cart,"There's no denying McInerney's talent for glibly flowing prose, and a facility for lip-curling one-liners...and yet...I can't help feeling the slightness of all this. Kidding the linked worlds of fashion, Hollywood and celebrity glamour is just too easy a task, not to mention the author's helpless adoration of what he pretends to lampoon. McInerney's tales from the land of gloss, far from rocking the boat, actually exist to convey his own insider's status. I always hoped JM would develop into a substantial writer of three dimensions (which does occur in places in BRIGHTNESS FALLS) but overall he seems terminally pleased with his position as ""Prince of the Pastry Cart."" Then there are the forgettable magazine stories (some of them over 10 years old!) tacked on to this book to jack it up to salable length. I'm disappointed, and will re-read my copy of THE DAY OF THE LOCUST."
1,Final nail in the TNG coffin.,"I can't decide what's worse, this horrific movie or the ""fans"" who gave it 5 stars!I remember walking out of the theater in 2002 in shock and very angry at what had become of my beloved ST:TNG. I had suffered through some pretty badStar Trek movies in my time but this was the absolute lowest Rick Berman could take the franchise. The plot was just plain ludicrous.Hackneyed dune buggy chases. A retarded Data clone that they just happened to find. A vengeful Romulan Picard clone (?) willing to start an intergalactic war and destroy Earth to get a blood transfusion. And the icing on the cake was the killing off of Data. This angered me. It was supposed to be a noble act of self-sacrifice but it came across as superfluous and stupid. I couldn't even watch TNG reruns after that. I wish this movie had never been made."
1,one long ad for Nike and Brand Jordan,"There is no one in sports that I love more than MJ, being a Bulls fan since the 1960s. I still love Michael, but this book was a supreme disappointment. By and large, it is an all too detailed history of the design and sales success of his shoes and newer clothing line, peppered with Michael's passages about being determined and ""driven"", which all ring true, but have been stated many times before and in better form. If you really want to learn about MJ, I would suggest Playing for Keeps by David Halberstam or The Golden Boys by Cameron Stauth, which profiles the members of the 1992 Olympic Dream Team. The profiles on MJ and the other team members are probably the best I have read on elite professional athletes. If you want some great photos and a book written by MJ, Rare Air is much better than this one."
1,Is that all?,"Though ""I Swear"" is a great song, this group will go down in history as All-4-One hit wonders"
2,steve is good.,"great music from an awesome, genuine songwriter / guitarist. Also: One of the best live contemporary jazz shows you'll see!"
2,"Very nice, but not perfect","The vocal levels are a little low - I would have expected the vocals to have been recorded a little better (louder), but this IS a recording from 60 years ago...Still, you're not going to buy this version to hear Beethoven's 9th for the first time - you're probably like me: looking for the ULTIMATE Beethoven's 9th. Sorry to say, ""this isn't it.""But, if you are that rare person who's shopping for their first copy, this is a very nice one."
2,Perfect fit. Easy to install,Subject says it all. Matched the wires up to my new head unit and within minutes had it powered up and working. I'm guessing MUCH easier to use one of these than guess at all the wires you're cutting/matching up.
2,Great way to learn a language,This CD/Book was a Christmas present for my son. He really loves the CDs and the book. He says the book is very helpful and especially likes the chapter reveiws that are in the book. The CDs help perfect your accent and also help to get your ear used to hearing the language. Was well woth the price.
2,Simmons Beautyrest latex pillows,"Well we read all of the reviews and decided to take a gamble that the pillows would be what we wanted. They are GREAT, good ""push-back"" and neck support. They aren't MEMORY FOAM, so if that's what you are after, forget these. But if you are looking for a firm latex foam pillow, you should be happy with this pillow! Couldn't be happier with them!"
2,Good CD.,"This CD is very cool but don't expect anything too original here. One of the songs is on ""Plastic Soul Impalement"", and one was later remixed on ""Throwing A Wrench..."" (I use the term remix loosely, they sound completely different). This CD shows the beginnings of an awesome band. 4 stars."
2,Wonderful Game!,I think that Capcom did an excellent job creating this game. The graphics are stellar and the storyline is great. It keeps your attention and you definitely have to use brainpower to figure out the BEST way to have Zack complete the task. This game was definitely slept on by A LOT of people but I hope that they create a sequel. This is one of those games that you can play over and over again.
2,Gutarists at a Crossroad,"Eric Clapton ""CROSSROADS"" Guitar Festival 2010 is without a doubt some of the BEST guitar work by GREAT guitarists that you will ever see in your life. So if you love Blues and Rock and a little bit country you will absolutely enjoy this 2 DVD performance. Thwe only flaw is: The next Crossroads needs to add Chaz DePaolo an international blues / rock guitarist, if not, well then catch a Chaz DePaolo show wherever you can, because Chaz Keeps his guitar talking through the whole performance. Any promoter or agent looking for a sound unlike traditional blues will find a marketable treasure chest in Chaz DePaolo. (c) TazTopics"
2,A Great horror film in a great horror series,"Writer-director Georger A. Romero's Living Dead trilogy is the best horror series out there tied with Sam Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy. In the first film Night of the Living Dead, a radioactive space probe wakes up the dead. They have a taste for human flesh and one bite can turn a human into a zombie. The sequel to Night, Dawn of the Dead, is the apocalyptic feature as we see chaos abrupting in cities. In the final (George WILL make another Living Dead movie) and best film of the trilogy, Day of the Dead, focuses on 12 remaining people in Florida. Once again, we have Romero's usual type of characters. A black man and a white woman who have the lead roles in the movie. They must try to hold off zombies and try to find a way to cure or control them. As the film's tagline says, The Darkest Day of Horror. That's exactly what the conclusion of the movie is like."
2,quick service excellent product,my item was shipped quickly and the price was very good for the excellent item I received.
1,"Awesome movie, misleading product","This is a great movie, nothing further needs to be said that hasn't been already. However, the studios manufacturing these, and including digital copies that are not usable by the time you buy the disc is ridiculous. This is the third of three movies that arrived today that include digital copy codes, all of which are useless due to expiration dates on the codes.Since it's illegal to make a legitimate digital copy to put on my home theater PC, this is an ******* move. Hollywood needs an enema. Of those three, ONE actually included the Amazon copy, which was a very kind nod from Amazon, that I'm sure they had to fight to get. This was not, however, that movie. And they wonder why piracy is so rampant when they do things that punish people who legitimately buy the movie (See that tag? Yah, purchased, not pirated, yet I cannot use my movie the way I want)."
2,Excellent,"I thought the book was excellent! I really enjoyed the story and the detail that was given about the victim, Dr. Brockton's life and the Cooke County Sheriff's Department.If your a first time reader you will enjoy the book, and if you are familiar with Dr. Bass as I am you will be able to relate to this novel."
2,love it,this is my new favorite series just discovered it and i am happy to find it on here. It came on time!
1,Old and not that good.,This book is very old and dated. It also has some pretty shaky advice like telling you to put a dent in the product you are trying to buy so you can get a discount. It also tells you to waste a bunch of the salesperson's time to try to get them to give you a deal. I had to force myself to finish the book because it just wasn't very good (and that is saying a lot because on average I read about 150 pages a day). At least it was cheap. I'm giving it a 2 star review because it wasn't horrible (which would be a 1 star review) but it wasn't even close to average. I would not read this book again and would not recommend it to anyone; might give it to the library.
2,I agree,"I agree with Stacey M. Wrona ""green designer"". I've order one box fromamazon.com and I was glad that the box had two solar lights. But, likeStacey said...they are not super bright. Some of the colors seems brightand some are low light. I've actually needed to get some regular whitesolar lights and it's a good blend to have a mix of the color lights andthe white solar lights. I will order one more box of the color lights."
1,Cheap but expensive,"In the first season of use, the front clasp broke off and one of the handle screws popped out...a cheaply made cooler but expensive (especially when compared to Coleman)."
2,Wham Bam Thank You Man!,"Mick Rock was in the right places and the right times and had all of the right friends. His book, GLAM! is a delicious mix of the glam rock bands that paved the way for music today. Look for David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed and Mick Jagger to name few. Total inspiration!"
2,The funniest movie i've ever seen.,This is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen before.The jokes are very funny and the cast is great.I heard this movie was good so I watched it and I laughed my but off.Everyone should see this movie because its really a great movie to watch along with the first movie too.
1,Christian Ministry,"If I had known the author was a Christian minister who believes faith and positive thinking solve everything, I would never have bought (and returned)this book.There's nothing new here. The book was first published in 1966 and ""updated"" in the 1980s. The information is old and repetitive.If you are a devout Christian and want to hear ""good news"" from a minister, you might like this book. If you want real-life, updated information, you won't find it here."
1,Horrible product this year,"I used TurboTax Premier last year & was so happy with it that I told everyone to buy it this year. What a fool I was. This years program was a nightmare. I will never purchase it again. Every time I needed to go back to check something, I had to go backwards through each page until I reached the page I wanted. Then to go forward to where you originally were, you had to retrace all your steps a second or third or fourth time. It got to the point I quit going back to check. It took hours this year and I am still not confident the results were correct. I may take it to H&R Block just to see if I need to file an amend. Next year I will try a different product. ---One other thing, navigating the State portion was so difficult. There were hidden pages in something called ""quick zoom"" or some such thing. I could never figure out where I was. Thanks for the headache Turbotax."
1,A boring waste of time and money,"This movie was so bad that it's hard to find words to adequately describe its total ineptitude.They had a couple of good ideas (barely), then added so much fluff that the gems of an idea or two were lost in the shuffle.The actors either shouted or mumbled their way through their lines, and the whole thing turned into one huge jumbled up mess.As for the so-called music! Yuck!"
2,One of the most extensive international cookbooks ever,"This book is packed with recipes from all over the world... It's the ""Joy of Cooking"" for world-wide cookery. A great deal of the book contains swedish cookery."
1,Piece of JUNK,Right out of the box it displayed HI even in meat that my instant read thermometer read 46F. I am returning this piece of garbage. Do yourself a favor and buy something else. I would give it 0 stars if I could.
2,"Good book, but not quite what I hoped for...","I am a small group leader, and needed both a historical and theological perspective regarding Satan. Pastor Lutzer provides some limited historical material, but his main focus is the theological aspects concerning Satan and his relationship to our all-powerful God. Despite the limited historic information, it is still quite a good book about Satan, and I highly recommend it. I really appreciate Pastor Lutzer's religious books!"
1,Anything but a value.,"I'm usually accepting of design and quality problems, depending on price, but the Safco 7121 Value Sorter brings both of these qualities to a new low. I put it together for someone in our office, and felt the need to review it to warn people.The shelves are cardboard. Not ""fiber board,"" unless cardboard falls into that distinction in your mind. It doesn't for me. The plastic pieces that are put on the sides and ends of the shelves are flimsy and offer little strength to the shelves.I recommend this product as a definite ""avoid."""
2,Wonderfully touching and inspiring!,"Absolutely wonderful, although very sad. I had to pace myself in reading this book toward the last several chapters because of how touched and saddened it made me feel. The lose of Sergei Grinkov is truly tragic to me as a simple fan but to Ekaterina as a partner, on the ice and in love was devastating for me to read. It leaves me anxious to read more on how she is getting on with her life on her own, with Daria, and as a skater. I hope she continues to write."
2,Big Dog Love it,"I bought this for my 9 month old German Shephard. He had torn through every toy we could fine; however, this one has held up and he loves to catch and chase it. He can bite it till it deflates, and as soon as he lets go it airs backup. Great toy."
2,"""He Wasn't Happy Unless His Nuts Were In a Vise""","Mr. Pryor used filmmaking as therapy, I think, to take a look at his own often-troubled life. While it's difficult to put a lot of this together without knowing the background on Richard Pryor, it's still a fascinating, heartbreaking, and funny film. My only real complaint is that it's too short; I'd love to see the outtakes on a future (hope, hope) DVD release. Sadly, this was Mr. Pryor's only directorial effort (aside from a concert film)."
2,jrb,The slide-aside is a great addition to the kettle grills. The function of this product is great and I would have given it 5 stars except for the clips that holds it to the grill. The clips tend to make the lid hard to get back on. You will have to work with the lid when you place it on off the grill.
1,I love Mamma Cass but....,"This CD sounds like it was made in a tunnel, but guys this may be the best we can get."
1,Temple,"... I'd rate it zero stars if that was an option. I've never taken the time to write a review, but I couldn't force myself to finish this book. It could have been a decent science fiction/adventure book if the author had done just a little bit of research into the U.S. military, which he seems to take pleasure in bashing. I suggest either he or his editor go on line before publishing any other books and doing just a little fact checking. Better luck next time."
2,"Insightful, but not Helpful","I originally thought this was going to be a self-help book for former children of child abuse. Instead, it reads like a novel. I guess you have to read the final book (My name is David) to get the full benefits of how the boy saught help AFTER he moved out of the house.Otherwise, it is a great book to relate to if you've been tortured yourself. I felt I was almost David myself in some parts. It's not for the light-stomached at all. Things happen that are rather disgusting, degrading, and beyond just normal physical/verbal/sexual violence. This is sad to say, but it's the one book that some people can say ""Well...at least THAT didnt happen to me."" Probably one of the worst accounts, but inspiring stories of child abuse I've read up on. If you're in for an emotional shocking 2-hour read, this is definetly the book for you."
2,So much better than grocery store items,"After working at a camp for many years, we were spoiled at having commercial duty scrubbers available. After leaving there, it was difficult to find a good metal scrubber retail. These are exactly what we wanted. Durable, strong, no rust, long lasting."
1,Jazmin's Notebook....good book?,"No, not really. It was just a book of journal entries and poems.It was just about a girl surrounded by drugs,sex,alcohol,and gunfire in Harlem. She is a real optimistic person and takes life day by day. It was a rather boring book and there was no climax in it. I would not reccommend this book to anyone over the age of 12."
2,"Emotional, Powerful, Fizzy","Long a stodgy devotee of baroque music, with the first few notes of this strong stuff I became an addict. Over and over again I play this CD, never quite anticipating the power and emotional bang of the music as it plays - even though I know the notes by now. If you ever studied Walter Piston's ""harmony"" the structures and transitions are back-of-the-book stuff, but the push is all elemental, basic, built-in, the familiar 1-4-5 with musical sequins, trampolines, backflips, and gelginite. Wow. And then some.I'm so besotted, I had a couple of 13-year old boys (my son and a friend) listen to it in the car one day. They were bug-eyed after a couple of cuts, and not with horror. Now they ask for it, and yell with glee when the musical tension breaks over their heads in crashing chords.Can I add a few more stars?"
1,Garage Door Monitor,This unit did not work and i was told to replace the batteries at my expense. I sent it back and i had to pay the return mail.I do not recommend this unit.
1,Jealous?,"Jealous? Not really. Just puzzled and deeply annoyed.I can't answer for others, but what annoys me is that there are LOTS of other, far more talented people who will NEVER get the promotion and publicity they deserve. (And I'm NOT talking about myself or any members of my family.) When someone with no discernable talent whatsoever gets this kind of insane saturation promotion by the record industry, it's a fair question to ask why. There are girls at my local high school who can sing and dance and play guitar much better that Lindsay can. So, like an earlier reviewer asked, WHY HER?"
1,This lamp does not last,"After 3 years of using our Sony TV, we needed a new lamp. I bought this lamp in July, and by the following February it had already burnt out. The original lamp lasted 3 years for about $200, and this lamp lasted 7 months for about $100. Save your money and get the real lamp from Sony."
1,"Weak, lukewarm, flavorless coffee","I called Melitta to make sure I was operating the machine properly, and I was. The coffee looks dark, but is weak, flavorless, and not served hot enough. And I don't even like my coffee very hot! Very disappointed."
2,An analytical approach to a review of this tantalizing book.,"I appreciated this book on so many levels it is hard to pick one which i can analyticaly review it. First of all i appreciated the way this book approached the semantics with respect to disambiguation. If i were to sum up this book in one word it would be ""anthropic"". I appreciated the way the author expressed his great sympathy for those of us who are in the eccentric genius field."
2,I found Skeafe,I found Skeafe in County Cork in the 17th Century! Plus this book is hardbound which really helps because I can really tear through the paperbacks. It is the first place I look.
1,A defense for murderers,"If you want to read a book that excuses four teenagers for brutally murdering a helpless child, this is the book for you. For page after page you will be treated to their sob stories: Melinda was molested by her father, Laurie's mother was a wacko religious fanatic, Toni was raped and the police didn't do anything about it, Hope's family life was turbulent. And all this is supposed to excuse torturing a twelve year old girl, then burning her alive. This isn't a book about the horrible crime that was committed against Shanda Sharer, it's an attempt to ""explain"" the actions of her murderers. In my opinion, a better choice would be ""Little Lost Angel"". This version acknowleges the problems the girls faced but places the blame with Melinda, Toni, Laurie and Hope, where it belongs, and gives the sympathy to poor little Shanda and her family."
2,Knock Yourself Out,"This is pretty decent stuff. I would love to get my hands on some other material that Hendrix did with Curtis Knight. I used to own ""Get The Feeling"", and ""Dreaming"" on cassette. I know that there's a cd, or tape with the song ""Suspicious"" too. I used to own that, and it has a killer alternate version of ""Room Full Of Mirrors"". I would love to get my hands on a cd copy of his ""Before London"" album the most though. It has this killer surf music tune, and I can't remember what the name of it was. If anyone has information please email me atdanrh@cfl.rr.comThanks,Dan"
2,The tree that keeps on giving,"I've been reading this book for 25 years, hundreds of times when my child was young, and dozens of times since, to visiting children. It is now my book of choice as a baby gift, along with a tree that flowers each year on or around the child's birthday. Their own giving tree, that gives to them, and to the environment as well. Response to this gift has been amazing."
2,It's The Orb,You know how an Orb album is like in that you don't know how it's going to be but somehow you know it'll be weird . Basically this doesn't disappoint and is one for the major Orb fan while it should please newcomers .Enjoy
2,Best of Pop Trance,"While I usually find it prudent to avoid overhyping popular trance, this is just a great track. More than just accumulating massive popularity, it has spawned a whole range of remixes and even remixes of other songs that mirror the rhythm of this track.Many complaints about Anthemic trance involve it being ""too predictable"" or ""suffering from a power outage"". This track lacks those problems."
2,A Beautiful Novel based on the Biblical story of Hoseah,"A story of redemption that will leave you in tears, wish you were more faithful to the Lord and wanting to be forgiving like He is."
2,genius!,I love the ridiculousness of Thunderwake. I love Greg and I love his character! I laughed way too much. I absolutely look forward to seeing more of Mr.Sisco!!
1,I bought this at walmart...I wasted $6,I believe when I bought it the little numbs started picking up some fabric dye off a cheap red shirt...and then I was trying to dust off a white shirt with the same mitt and the red came one the white.I had to rebleach my white and I couldn't believe what a horrible waste the mitt was. The plastic part eventually peeled off from the fabric part of the mitt which made it flimsy.
2,Informative and Engaging,"As someone who is in the throes of research, I've been reading quite a number of books on tenement life in Glasgow and this is one of the better ones. It provides a cohesive flow of discussion about what life was like during this thirty-five year span. Well-organized and comprehensive, Jean Farley includes discussion on a broad scope of aspects of tenement life, even--or especially--the minute details. The word pictures were evocative and many of the stories warming. I felt that I came away from the book with a better understanding and appreciation for the culture and the sense of loss that was felt by many when these tenements were demolished. It's well worth reading!"
1,Rippoff,As it is typed Blues Saraceno (VHS) that means Video tape and all I got was a booklet from the videoso I can not write a review about it I use to buy these used from guitar stores for $5.00-$10.00 but I never got one!
2,The Best Out There,"I own this electric skillet and it is the best one out there, hands down. I have used electric skillets for years and years, have owned many sizes and brands. All the old ones, every one of them, all had the curse of non even cooking especially around the edges. Not on this Cuisinart, it cooks evenly and gets the foods closer to the edges cooked the same and in the same time frame, perfectly. This unit is hefty as well, not like the el cheapo Prestos and Rivals, etc. You know it's quality the second you get it out of the box. It's a bit spendy, BUT it out performs any other out there, and I think I've had them all. If it's an electric skillet you are after, SPLURGE and buy this one!!!!! You will LOVE it."
1,Why pay for info when you can get it for free?,"I made the mistake of buying this book and later found the same information on Fidelity's website under the investment planning section. You'll also want to check out wealth management resources. Try Morningstar's website. From there you can find more financial info than Suze Orman provided in her book, and you won't have to muddle your way through the therapy sessions that she includes in her book."
2,Stimulating Learning,"In his works, Dr. Younkins has created a clear and concise piece of material. This book offers a straight-forward account of the foundations of free enterprise. Through this book, one is able to fully understand such subject matter as ownership, progress, governance, the obstacles to a free society, and the relationship between the individual, the community, and the state. Capitalism and Commerce truly leaves the individual with a sense of the meaning of ""the common good"" of society, personal flourishing and happiness, and a solid summary of the ideals of collectivist thinkers. I would recommend this book to any current or aspiring business man or woman, lawyer, or simply for anyone who loves the freedom of capitalism!"
2,The best book I've read in a LONG time!,"Joylynn Jossel has nailed it with Root of All Evil! This book has you laughing, crying, sitting on the edge of your seat, and yearning for more. It's an excellent book, well written and shows some of the struggles that women go through in everyday life. Her writing grabs you and takes you on a journey that you dont want to end. Joylynn Jossel is one author that will be around the literary world for a long long time."
1,"Disappointing, like other new Firm DVDs","I love the Firm and particularly Allie, but I'm very disappointed with this and the other new Firm DVDs. Some of the four-limb segments are good, but I find the aerobics segments unnecessarily complicated and they don't even raise my heart rate. With my older Firm DVDs, I always feel like I've had a workout; with these new ones, I don't. Also, these new routines feel harder on my knees (because of twisting more than impact) and back. I have minor back problems, and I find myself modifying the moves in these new DVDs to protect my back from being strained/""put out."" And I miss the fannylifter/transfirmer. I don't know if these changes are because Gaiam now owns the Firm, but I really hope they go back to the more intense, more straight forward routines. I would return this one and get my money back if I could. Sorry Allie!"
1,not good,"These liners are not good! I bought these specifically to protect our baby's cloth diapers when he has to use heavy-duty diaper cream- they do not do the job well. They are rough, tend to bunch up, and tear easily, resulting in diaper cream all over the diapers. Great. We had another brand before this (I can't remember which brand) and they were much, much better. I strongly recommend buying a different brand."
1,Not pleased,"The item we ordered is not what we got. We were sent an email stating that the gun had been shiped. Four days later we recieved a phone call saying that the gun was out of stock. I told them it had already been shiped. They told me it had not. They asked if we wanted to replace it with a comprable gun. We said yes, not to disapoint our son. The gun came and was not even electric. Which in our opion was not comprable."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"My wife and I have really enjoyed Dickens film adaptations such as Bleak House, Little Dorritt and Our Mutual Friend. So it was with this expectation that we purchased the Pickwick Papers. We forced ourselves to watch two episodes thinking that it would get better as the story moved along. It only seemed to get worse. The acting was barely tolerable and even laughable at times. The film quality itself was much poorer than other adaptations and left us very disappointed. I was fooled by the good reviews some people gave it. Take my word for it, don't buy it."
1,VERY Disappointing - BROKE at first battery change...,"mp3 players are wonderful! And I was in love with this unit - until the first time I tried to change the battery. The battery is attached thru the memory ""backpack"" and sliding this unit off and on is difficult. When the pins for the memory chip failed to line up perfectly, they broke - rendering this product useless. Make sure that the mp3 player you end up with uses Compact Flash cards for memory, is upgradable, and has more than 32mb of memory (32mb holds 6 to 8 songs). Good luck!!"
1,Bad Fiction,"This was a slow, painful journey to the center of the earth. The story lacked any interesting content. The attempts at suspense failed. It's the worst book I've been exposed to in some time. There are far better ways to spend your time."
2,Brought back memories,Purchased for 7 & 9 yr. old Godsons. They love it. Had to find and buy them coonskin caps. They know the theme song by heart. It brought back memories of when I was a little girl.
1,Reel jumps off the rod,"Pros: It packs up nice. I has extra compartments in the case for a few pieces of tackle. It is easy to assemble, break down, and pack into case.Cons: I had to restring the reel with new line because the line that came with it kept snapping. I lost two fish because of it. The biggest con is the fact that when I get a hit and snatch the rod back, about every other time the reel will jump off the rod. Then I have to bumble around and get the reel back on quickly so I can continue reeling the fish in. I don't have the problem at all when I put the reel on another rod. I have tried tightening it, but it just seems to be a flaw in the design."
1,Junk,"First off, the packaging was horrible. It came in a box not much bigger than the pan with NO packing at all. The handle was sticking out the side of the box when I got it!! No biggie though. I opened the box and found the pan to be of poor quality, the handle was barely long enough for me to hold in my hand and with no handle opposite, it would be a chore to move this baby around when you had a few pounds of food in it!! The casting was REALLY rough and you could see that there was about a 3 inch spot in the middle where the casting was very thin. This thing was junk and I sent it back to be replaced by a Lodge. Bayou Classics are cast in China and they look like it!! Wish I knew that before I ordered it!!"
1,Extremely disappointing,"A dammed shame - a book with a lot of potential but does not live up to the rest of the Scarpetta novels.Moves to the third person making the writing a disappointment.Seems to have got lost writing the Scarpetta novels - crisp, strong plot, great character definition and tangled but easy to follow plot. Follows more of the dodgy Cop novels with short chapters and chopping and changing between characters.Interesting story with the person under protection by the FBI/Senator Lord etc. Fairly believeable, but fails to deliver a good plot line based on ""The Last Precinct"" and ""Black Notice"".A disappointing read all in all. Will I buy the next one in hardback? - very doubtful now. Borrow it from the library before making the decision to buy."
1,Blu-ray of Big Lebowski did not work on my Samsung Blu-ray player!,"This was a Xmas gift and I was very upset when my son was unable to play this blu-ray on our Samsung player- which is maybe a year old. The Amazon product information does not state this. The back of the box does state ""that it may not play on some players"", in very fine print of course, but how is one to know until it's opened and tried. One doesn't usually read the fine print of a blu-ray or DVD! Waiting to hear from him if it worked on his PS3. Not happy- Beware of this blu-ray!"
1,NO SMELL,I think the reason I have always liked Yardley English Lavender Soap was the wonderful fragrance. I can't believe I paid so much for this soap and it must be very old or fake. It doesn't even physically resemble the real thing. Save your money.
1,Book delivered on a camel's back,I ordered this book for a son's short term class only lasting 26 days. The book took 20 days to get here!!! I am wondering why in the 21st century does it take 20 days to come from Arizona to Virginia? I assumed it had been strapped on a back of a camel and had hiked from Timbuktu! This is outrageous in 2010! I will never order from Book Zoo again!
2,Pain Free 123,"Pain Free 1 2 3, is a good read if you are experiencing pain. This book gives you several options to choose from."
1,A real shame. Propoganda at best.,"Jessica happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. It's as simple as that. This book is nothing more than a propoganda piece about Jessica. Who is the real hero in this story? Not Jessica. This book should have described the folks who died trying to save everyone else. Passages read as if she actually did something--she didn't. In fact, she was in the Humvee crying while others were taking bullets. This is a real shame that a barely articulate woman has received such fan fare. The nude photos of her are probably more interesting than her ridiculous story...Save your money."
2,"Financial Freedom for the ""not so rich""","I read this in 1992 & have used the principles ever since. I've recommended both the book & the ideas countless times over the past 20 years. This may be the single most influential book I've ever used. I was not terribly in debt when I first used the ideas, & haven't ever been. I started with a ""spending plan,"" which I used relentlessly for years, now I just informally follow the ideas. The single idea I liked the most was the idea that I am in charge of my money & can use it to obtain whatever is important to me, & even a modest income will suffice. I cannot recommend it strongly enough if you feel you want to be more in charge of your finances."
2,Great Value / Quality,"Not much on words but this Microscope is a great Value for my needs. Easy to set up and seems to be working great so far, used only a few times."
2,Loved this book,"Fantastic book with incredible writing. I could not put it down once I started reading it. The story was so engulfing it kept me wanting more and more with each page I read. This book was such a joy to read, I can't wait for more books from Mr. Rhoda."
1,Dorothy costume,"This is an adorable but flimsy costume. Don't expect it to last a long time. Also, the sizing is a little different. I bought a size 4-6 only to find out thatit fits ages 3-4. My 4-year-old loves the costume, but a sturdier version would have been preferable."
2,Great purchase!,This knife holder is very durable and easily holds and entire block worth of knives. Was easy to hang and has helped reduce clutter on our kitchen counter. We love it and have already recommended it to many of our friends.
1,Review from the Synthesis,"The second album from grunge-era supergroup Audioslave plays out more like a boring `90s alt-rock mixtape than anything else. It's sad that a talented band like Rage Against the Machine has to play second fiddle to Chris Cornell's ridiculous growls and Jesus Christ posing. Honestly, it sounds like Tom Morello isn't even trying anymore as he strums his guitar, rewrites his past riffs and dicks around on his diverse collection of effects pedals. These guys have just done it so many times over again, it's now become unwelcome nostalgia. They prove this with the album's first radio-ready single, ""Be Yourself."" C'mon, it sounds like Cornell is taking songwriting lessons from Raffi as he sings ""be yourself is all that you can do."" Sorry, it's not going to work this time around.- Nick WalkerSynthesis.net"
1,"Hands down, the worst book I've ever read","I'm not into book bashing - every book has its redeeming points - but this was just a horrible waste of time and money. My book club was in complete agreement as well. Thin, predictable characters; no plot; focus on random aspects of Austen's books; sloppy ending that glossed over details in order to wrap things up; and no discernable parallel to Austen's work. One ambitious member of my book club even pulled out old copies of Austen's novels in an attempt to find the links between Fowler's work and Austen. She found nothing. I kind of feel bad writing this review, but the book was so horrible it made me mad at everyone involved with bringing it to life. Don't waste your time - and don't fall for the ""book club"" marketing gimmick like we did."
1,An Education,"I was not fond of this movie. It is about a girl coming of age and falls in love with an older man. I like both of these actors, but just did not like the story line."
1,Selling themselves short,"With the line up that this band boasts, I was seriously disappointed with this record. Everything from the lyrics to the chord progressions to the hooks and choruses scream ""play me on the radio"".Im not as surprised that Artie Shepard from Errortype:11 had a hand in this as I was to see Tom Capone and Joe Grillo's named as co conspirators.While I am in no way going to judge the motives of the band,as everyone is entitled to live off their tunes if they are presented with the opportunity and if they want to ape carbon copy bands like Sevendust or Godsmack ,then so be it.But fans of any of the members previous bands would be well advised to not be duped into buying this."
2,I LOVE this scanner and am sad it's no longer available.,"I LOVE this scanner and am sad it's no longer available. The stack-feeder for prints is awesome. I loved being able to put a stack of photos in, press a button, walk away, and come back and all photos were scanned and saved. My scanner no longer works but it's because we took it apart to clean the underside of the glass and must not have put it back together right. ""My bad."" Anyway, now that I want to replace mine and this is no longer available, I'm quite sad. I can't seem to find anything similar out there either and I'm really unhappy about that."
1,"If you were there, it's O.K; if not this leaves a lot of questions","If you already have a good grounding in the ""Sixties,"" this production isn't bad.The problem is that it really is more 1964-74 rather than the ""Sixties."" It glosses over many of the events, and if you have the background that's O.K. because you KNOW the necessary details. But, if you are mostly clueless about the times the necessary background to understand why events are occurring is arguably sparse.I also find the use of current era talking heads from 1990s to explain what is happening is a bit distracting. We had fine news coverage in the 1960s. Why not use that footage to explain the times and supplement it with comments from current social commentators, rather than do it in the reverse as this production does.For those who want to relieve the days, it's an O.K. piece, though a bit shallow. For those who don't have a clue and want to understand what happened, I'm afraid it will leave them a bit lost."
2,Another Gem,"Marian is such a talented writer, I love her books. They are fun to read but also have depth. The characters are believable and she really sucks you in. Whenever I finish one of her books I always want to know more. The characters are like good friends that you don't want to leave. I always read her books at least twice because once I know the story I can read it slower and enjoy the beauty of her writing and the not so obvious jokes that I sometimes miss on the first pass."
1,Not flash cards,"This product has been mislabeled by the publisher. It is a booklet of Spanish verb forms, but it is not flash cards. The book is made of paper in a normal binding, and claims to be in a flash card format, whatever that means. It is a reference book on Spanish verbs, not a set of flash cards for studying on the run."
1,Not recommended for couple play,"This product is probably pretty good for the anal beginner. The beads are small and easy to pop right in... but the tiny bit of ""string"" at the end of the beads makes it very hard to keep a hold of them if you plan on having sex with using them or having someone else use them on you. The beads slide in so easily that the rest (only about an inch and a quarter) can easily follow and give real reason to be scared. I don't recommend these even though they are priced to sell."
2,Jerry Bruckheimer scores another sixer,"The success key to all Jerry Bruckheimer films is the brilliant music score. Stuff the songs. The score is what makes a film. Be it Hans Zimmer, Trevor Rabin, Mark Mancina or Harry Gregson Williams... The guy knows what'll go. Enemy of the state starts off with a perfect theme which gets you into the action mood, then takes you deeper into the emotional mood. Not very artistic, but it's commercial score at a very high level. Go Jerry Bruckheimer!!!"
1,"Weak on facts, strong on empathy","This books is good for someone who's unfamiliar with hypoglycemia, but is weak on specific facts on nutrition and biology. The Carbohydrate Addict books by Drs. Rachel Heller and Richard Heller provide much more factual information."
1,Sluggish at best,"I couldn't bear reading this book for long periods of time because I would fall asleep. It does have a theme and a moral, although a seemingly generic one at that. I don't want to overly influence anyone's decision to read this book, but think twice if you don't like extremely slow moving books."
2,Got me hooked on 'em all.,"I had got this book after it came out a while ago, but did not read it for a few months after I had bought it. I did not think I would like it despite the reviews it had recieved. Boy, was I kicking my own butt after I got done with the book. I went out and got the next one after that, then have sat impatiently waiting for the rest to come out. This is one of the best book series I have read. I just got buy the books, I dont read the back. Julian was sexy and his story made my heart twist. Espically that part at the end.........which I will not tell you about. I could not believe it though. And the ending rolled from there. This book was a not-put-downable at all. From the beginning to one of the best endings I have ever read. I really loved this ending. I just wish in all my book searches I could find a book like that one.............."
1,4 months & no magazine,I ordered this magazine in Aug & it's almost the end of December & I still haven't received my first issue yet. It's been a month that I've contacted customer service and I'm still waiting for my first issue.I'm editing my review. It's now 5 months & STILL NO MAGAZINE! They keep telling me to wait & I will receive my first issue soon. They told me this 3 times already.I DO NOT RECOMMEND ORDERING THROUGH HERE. SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG!
1,Poor game,"The game never would load. I have double checked the spec. and I meet or excede all the Spec. The game says media not found and I have downloaded all new drivers for every thing just to see if that was the problem, still no luck. Wedd site no help eather. Becareful if you buy this game!!!!"
1,Emerson Maui Bay tropical ceiling fans,"If you like the looks fine but dont buy this item for keeping cool.I bought 5 for my new home and removed all of them as they dont push air like they should and are heavy with a bulky motor,not to mention very expensive.Emerson fails to mention,except written on the box that the brushed Stainless isnt recomended for Outdoor use yet it is advertised so.they are decorative but living in HOT South Florida they arent very good at keeping a 12 foot high ceiling home cool.We did stay with Emerson and Buy the Advant Eco wich is wonderful,6 speeds and will blow you away.These fans are for looks only,from experience,never buy a 3 speed ceiling fan which is what these are and EXPENSIVE!!I put them in my rentals with 8 foot ceilings so I didnt lose any money"
2,Nice shirt,The shirt is very nice. I bought it as a christmas gift for my father & he really liked it.
2,I had shoulder surgery and needed something that would be sturdy enough and adjustable to meet my needs.,"I needed something that would be sturdy enough and adjustable to meet my needs as my shoulder was immobile. The fact it was adjustable and could be raised or lowered, brought in close enough to be near me made all the difference. Now that I have more movement it can be folded and put away brought out for other uses down the road.I would recommend this product."
2,An almost perfect viewing experience!,"I have watched this concert on laser disc and on VHS tape and have always marvelled at the brilliant performances of its dream cast and the show's wonderful songs. That is why I decided to get the DVD to have better video and audio quality. Well, the picture quality is definitely better than its laser disc/VHS counterpart, but I was a bit disappointed at the audio quality. The sound is weak on DVD as I have to adjust my volume control to almost maximum level to really appreciate the sound. Also, it would have been a lot better if the audio had been on 5.1 digital instead of just stereo. A DTS version would have been perfect. For what better way to appreciate a good musical than by having excellent audio quality."
2,Stalwart,"What Heroes Unlimited lacks in diversity and customization (point buy systems have this staple pretty much cornered) it makes up for in overall playability and dozens of raodblocks to game abuse. Don't misunderstand, any game can be min/maxed, but the Palladiums strict class system makes it much more difficult than games with more freedom.This is a great game to introduce players to (I, myself, started with Ninjas & Superspies back in the late 80s). It is great as a standalone book (in fact, the sourcebooks are mostly fluff, the game just doesn't need anything else)."
1,AVOID.,dis is crap stuff. simply a waste of plastic n money. the producers must b blind. worst artist ive eva seen since i was born. i repeat again. AVOID.
2,"Hooks Through Your Grateful Head, Hooks, Hooks","My goodness, people, what is going on? Have reviews been eliminated/compromised/deleted/rejected/dejected? I'm the first to review this great ep? Why aren't these guys the new Beatles/Kinks/Stories/etc? I know that it's a New World out there, but c'mon, these guys are incredible. What the hell? Hooks, hooks, hooks. First song is the best, the last is the worst, but that's not saying all that much, because they're all pretty damn great. This is a crap review, I know, I'm old and tired, but these guys will make you realize."
1,Degrading to Women,"This book degrades women. The hero of the story spanks, then fondles the heroine. Then later nearly rapes the heroine, while she is saying no. They are alone on an idea, and instead of trying to find ways to survive, the hero wants sex. This book gives the wrong message to young female readers."
1,"Not impressed, we've had TWO tables break","Leapfrog has some sort of major mechanical fail with this table. We have had two completely fail on us. Both have had the identical issue, when my son pushes the buttons something shorts out and the table starts making a rapid fire machine gun noise. The lights go crazy also.Both times it happened after about a month of minimal use.I'm now waiting for a response from Amazon to see if they'll just refund us for the second table, as my patience isn't up for seeing if a third table will break (but my guess is yes, it will)."
1,Interesting but not very useful,"An interesting cookbook if you want to learn about the area. But after leafing through it a couple of times, I can't find anything that looks worth cooking : It's focus is on authentic, local cusine rather than recipes that an American cook could make with readily available ingredients. Grab theWilliams-Sonoma Essentials of Mediterranean Cooking: Authentic recipes from Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, The Middle East, North Africaif you want inspiration and a great collection of useful recipes."
2,A safe purchase. 5 Year Warranty!,"I had tried for so long to find a reliable hard drive. This is the only company that has so much faith in their product that they include a 5 year warranty. Seagate offers a very reliable product, and you can rest easy knowing that they will take care of it for the next 5 years. After trying and researching other hard drives, I am extremely happy that I purchased this product.Whatever you do, don't buy Iomega!! HORRIBLE customer service and unreliable machines!"
2,"about the title..the cook, the thief, his wife and her lover....",Welcome to the world of barbaric style of movie which the story is basically about how a handsome looking man keep finding woman to have sexual relationship in the kitchen hiding behind curtains (behind the room which held big feast occasions) whom he later have sexual relationship with one of the tyrant's wife where he later found out the problem and get him killed. He is asked to use a folk and a knife to cut his flesh and eat which he was later shot to dead. What I can say is that this is the best kitchen around the world that can cater differnt activities inside. No longer why our kitchen are getting smaller these modern days due to things been exposed. Hmm...a second thought..
2,very nice sound but can't get it to fit right,"I love the sound, but out of all the supplied fitting options, I still cant get a good fit."
2,Nice little guitar,My grandaughter was very happy with this little guitar. It's just the right size for learners. Beautiful guitar. I am happy with my purchase.
2,Their Joy Shows!,"Point of Grace has once again given us an album of songs that are absolutely unbelievable. Their songs and voices clearly show how much joy they have in their hearts! I can't listen to this CD with out feeling an uplift of my spirits, and wanting to sing along! If you love joyful songs with great harmonies, you'll love this recording!!"
2,Great backup voices if you want Salsa swing this is it !!!,"Issac Delgado a smooth salsa singer from Cuba with a great (Coro),check out amigo a duet with Puerto Rico's Cheo Feliciano. Latin Lovers you have to get this one..for dancers and listeners. Obsesion and Sandunguita...Muy Chevere!!!!"
1,extremely noisy,"not sure why two reviews below say the unit is not noisy. I got this one because of two favorable reviews... I thought that it was going to be quiet and can leave it in my living room. and, I was wrong about that.it was very noisy! I got this one from Lowes. I am planning to return this after one day of use. It was at least 5 times louder than my refregerator. very disappointed."
1,More Memoirs of a Papillion: Diary of a Mad Dog,"I'm glad I bought this book as a paperback for I don't think it's a keeper. I lost so much interest in the story that I still haven't finished reading it. It just drags and is not near as light as the first one written. Analogy:No name makes it big with a sleeper, low budget movie and becomes a household name overnight.(Crowd roar). Next move, to do it again with a sequel. And we all know how that turns out. Sorry, this book was written with that exact scenario in mind so if you just have to have this book, find it at the second hand store for a dollar of let this site know that you have interest in taking it off my hands."
1,Ipod Classic is junk,I bought the IPOD classic and had to return the first and second one for the same reason. The wheel doesn't want to move smoothly. The more I read about these online the more I see that its a design flaw. Amazons Customer service was first rate.
2,Muscle Shoals Alabama & Fame Recording Studio....,"Hey, I've never heard an album by Wammack, but I've heard him live on dozens of occasions. He still is quite good. He tends to cover stuff now as oppose to playing his old songs. He lives in Muscle Shoals Alabama now and he plays at the W.C. Handy Festival annually and other musical gatherings. He is a guitar pioneer in my view. He should have been lead guitar for some major band, but never really got a lucky break as a soloist. His son ""Monkey"" had some success too. Both of which recorded at the legendary Fame Recording Studio."
1,Main cord sticks to the side when plugged in,"The way most outlets are installed on the wall, the cord sticks to the side, rather unsightly, rather than going straight down (or up). There is no way to lay the cord neatly; I purchased this to plug my phones on my kitchen counter and the lateral sticking cord looks unsightly; I consider this a design flaw. Probably the best option would have been to have the plug rotate freely so the cord can be arranged neatly regardless of the position of the plug/outlet/cord (albeit for a higher price)."
2,Just the perfect camera,"This camera is so amazin, perfect size, perfect pictures and very good price. The only thing bad in this camera is that only has 3x of optical zoom.This camera is a very good choice fro who want a very nice camera for a good price."
1,I HATE BRATZ,They are the most disguisting dolls to be on earth and influence our daughters. My sister luvs bratz and [...]. She wants to dress like them so before you buy your kids one ask yourselves: would you want you child dressing just like them. hmmmm I wonder. well heres all I have to say.... [...]!
1,Awful,"-Loud whirs when trying to play a DVD-Weird errors (""i.e. ""No Disc"")-Half the time the sound doesn't work-Just stops working sometimesDefinitely do not recommend this DVD player"
2,Great Alternative for Moms-to-be,This is a great book for parents-to-be who already use and believe in homeopathy. It is a little detailed for beginners. This should be required reading for every OB and Midwife. The case histories are wonderful!
2,Handy MP3 Player,"Plays MP3's to your car FM Radio. Sound is good quality, this depends also on your car FM radio. I listen to this every day on the way to work, and I have no trouble with the sound.I keep all the MP3's stored on my flash drive, then just plug into the Modulator. The handy thing is, that it remembers the last MP3 played, so it always restarts from the same track when the car starts. That's important, I used to have another modulator with out this feature, and it drove me nuts.I would recommend this, to anyone who wants to play MP3's in the car, but doesn't want the hassle of installing a fixed MP3 player.Remote control proved to be useful. I can always keep my eyes on the road. The only thing lacking, is an LCD display. But modulators with LCD displays cost about twice as much.Also, it doesn't overheat, and stays cool."
2,A great product but...,"These really aren't a very good value. If I had to do it over again, I would probably get Wilkinson locking tuners which are much less expensive and a lot easier to install. If money is no object and you need the F trademark on your tuners, then I guess these are for you."
1,POOR QUALITY PRODUCT-DO NOT BUY,Item was poorly constructed of cheap materials and looks far better in the photo than what arrived. It is comprised of a very thin metal sheet over plastic and is quite disappointing. It takes a long time to unscrew the top ball and it sits crooked when fully screwed in. The smaller pole leans and is also crooked. I had a similar product in the past that was actually made of quality stainless steel. It was heavier and a better product. This product is a waste of money and a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! I should have returned it. DO NOT BUY IT.
1,Don't waste your money,"Delonghi products in my opinion are garbage...this toaster just died after 1 year. Never toasted correctly, always needed 2 cycles. It has not been heavily used as it is just for my wife and I.Also have a Delonghi kettle that started leaking in 8 months.Looks good...for what that is worth."
1,I don't know what the fuss is all about,"To be kind, I should say that perhaps I am way past the stage in my journey for this to be helpful. I might have benefitted from this when I was still in shock and grief. I was looking for a way to help me re-make myself- a way to truly figure out how to rebuild my life and get on with it. This wasn't it for me. I had the book in my hands less than two days before I traded it on another site.If you are in the healing the pain stage, perhaps this will help. If you have accepted the pain and are now at the stage of what do I do now and how do I make sure I don't get back here again, not so much..."
2,"Works GREAT, have watch it many many times and no issues!",Purchased this as a gift and we both ending up love it! We are both wrestling fans but this isn't your everyday average wrestling the comentary the cursing and some of the off the wall obscene things that are said just cracked me up. We have watched this over and over with no issues at all with playing the disc. We will be ordering more of the JCW wrestling!!
2,A must-read for every woman,"I am 18 years old, and still I felt as though the topics Susan addresses in her book are a huge part of my life. Above my desk I have pictures of Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn taped up next to a poster of a fifties housewife with the caption ""Don't assume I cook."" My dog's name is Gidget and the mouse pad next to my computer is of Rosie the Riveter. Whew!! The media shapes and distorts us all. After reading this wonderful book I realized that my monthly internal arguement whether or not I should by the latest issue of Cosmopolitian is completely natural..And that it's ok to buy it every once and awhile. By doing so I am not undermining my beliefs that women and men should be equal or that the education and freedom of women needs to be a goal for us all. Ok that's enough. Buy the book, and then share it with a friend. This one is bound to be a classic."
1,Lousy product,"I ordered the Oritron DVD600 DVD-Video Player and frankly -- it stinks. The first one played about 6 DVD's OK, before freaking out and flashing colored static-like blocks all over the screen. Amazon was great -- they immediately shipped a replacement Oritron DVD600 DVD-Video Player, no charge. I thought that was the end of it. But no. This replacement one freaked out too -- after playing 4 DVD's successfully -- the same flashing colored static-like blocks all over the screen. :-(This was definitely not faulty DVD's -- they all play perfectly in my computer's DVD player. In fact DVD #4 which played perfectly this afternoon -- now will not play without all the colored ""static"". Remote stopped responding properly too.Give this one a miss. I am shipping it back and buying the Toshiba."
1,Read up on this product before you buy it.,"I used this on both my cats and it didn't work, so I called my vet and asked what to do next. I wasn't expecting to be told it was both useless and toxic! My advice - read up on this product before you decide to buy it. Had I done so, I would have made a very different choice."
1,Mildly interesting.,"I was looking forward to reading this, and had pretty high expectations after reading the AMAZINGThe Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America. While it tried to tie together Marconi and this murder it never really happened. Just two fairly disjointed accounts of an interesting historical event (wireless) and a pretty standard murder. Not bad, not a page-turner either."
1,Silpat,Silpat is non-stick the first time you use it. After that it is no different than any other surface despite the advertising.
1,worst book I ever read,"This is by far the worst book I ever read. The author didnt even use quotation marks so half the time you didnt know when the characters were talking or which ones were talking. The story didnt flow well at all, the sentences were typed wrong and all jacked up, and basically it took 228 pages to stretch out a story about her meeting the guy Cameron, staying at his grandmas house and than running away and getting shot all of a sudden in the end.... This book was awful!!! The story didnt flow well at all and I finished it in 3 hours. This book gets an F!"
1,Pleasant Game,"All the reviews I read here warned me of the low-quality of this game as far as learning goes, but encouraged me to get it if my child is obsessed with Dora. Since she is, I did get it, and I have been pleasantly surprised.I was very surprised to discover that the non L-Max Dora game works with the L-Max, not only in handheld mode, but also when connected to the T.V.. A very happy thing indeed.Not only does the dora game reinforce the basic Spanish language skills taught in the T.V. show, it expands on them a bit, adding nicely to the SSL vocabulary. The basic educational tasks are very young and immature for the average student, and my 6yo played all of the games on it, completing all of the tasks within a week of intermittent play. Now she gets bored with it easily, only playing it from time to time to get her Dora fix."
1,Un-American,"This is one of the more sickeningly anti-American movies i have ever seen. And at a time when service members are at war and dying and really need the country's support. Is there nothing these ""celebrities"" aren't willing to defile to put money in their pockets? They should all be ashamed."
1,"This is not science, this is superstition","Michael Behe argues that you have complex systems that will work only if all the components operate at once. He argues that you could not get such a thing from ""successive, slight modifications"". Hence the molecular machines inside living beings are evidence of an intelligent designer-God.Intelligent design asks interesting questions about evolution, but since all its answers are usually ""God"", scientists have rejected it.As the National Academy of Sciences has said, intelligent design ""and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life"" are not science because their claims cannot be tested by experiment and propose no new hypotheses of their own.This book is definitely not science nor an explanation of what evolution is. It is a (not particularly interesting nor well written) fiction novel."
2,Truly amazing!,"Perhaps one of the best pianists of the century plays the music that saved his life...Highlights are the Bach recording, which is thrilling and brilliantly played, and the two (count them!) recordings of Chopin's nocturne. Played with tons of emotion--keep in mind this particular piece saved his life--the last recording especially is truly heart-rending.For anybody who's ever heard a piano and liked it, or for any classical music person, this is an absolute must. I listen to it over and over, and never get tired of it. It's unfortunate he didn't record CDs and CDs and more CDs of stuff I could go out and buy. You need this CD.Even if, like me, you have yet to see the movie.And a special thanks to the Polish radio people, who salvaged these for our immense delight in listening!"
2,"Fun Book, But was disclosing pharma secrets worth it?","This was a fun book to read, however the author was recently terminated from Eli Lilly for writing it! I wonder if it was worth it for him to spill all of those drug rep secrets?"
1,Baby friendly ???,"Mustela baby products tend to be seen as middle or upper- shelve european cosmetics. At least I have seen them that way. I have bought and use bunch of them before reading labels for the first time. This one couldn't be labeled paraben-free and contain hydrogenated fat-if it's bad for human beings, does it matter which way it get into our system? And it is made for babies. I will not buy it again. One star for nice ""performance"" in the bathtub, my daughter enjoyed the great and long lasting foam and colour."
1,Expensive for so short relief,"Considering the cost of this product, I would have expected it eliminate the dog urine and feces oder in the back yard for more than 2 days. Even if it lasts a week, that's still a lot of money to be spending on this type of product."
2,Beware the Old One!,"Strange Eons is a trio of tales that chart the awakening of Cthulthu, the slumbering, dreaming Elder God of H.P. Lovecraft's mythos. Fans of the C.M. will want to snag this and gobble it up. Recommended."
2,disappointed that i saw the movie before reading the book,"i saw the movie like a year ago and it became one of my favorite ever since. i didn't figure out that it was a book until a couple months ago (yeah, im stupid) and i wasn't at all disappointed with the book. i did enjoy it, but there were parts in the movie that i thought were hilarious and became attached to (i guess you could say that) but then they werent in the book. they werent necessary parts, so i guess it didnt matter. another thing is that i saw the movie and only viewed it as good entertainment whereas the book i think has some meaning but i didnt catch it cuz i was just trying to be entertained and had it set in my mind that it was just supposed to be funny. still...i recommend reading the book and seeing the movie (in that order) they were both well worth my time."
2,Great product,"Purchased for my new G2. Works great, fast upload to my computer. Read all reviews before purchasing and seems the Viking is the best."
1,Quality not movie,This is a classic movie that I love but I gave it two stars because the QUALITY of the video is substandard.. I would expect this from a bootleg site not from a legitimate site. It will make me think twice about ordering another digital movie from here again.
2,Unusual war story makes you wonder about the ethics of this mission,"This long but fascinating story of a military officer and a group of prisoners makes you wonder about two things:spoilers..1. Is it right to get a bunch of prisoners to do something very dangerous, as if their lives were totally expendable?2. Is it right to trap the enemy in a shelter and then pour in gasoline and grenades to kill them like fish in a barrel?Great casting and plenty of action will keep you intrigued."
2,Looks great on Kindle Fire,"I am new to watching video on the Kindle Fire but it really looks great, like watching on a mini TV. I've always been a fan of Friends series, purchased this video to watch on a trip and it worked just fine."
1,Garbage!,"The worst DVD i have ever seen! They show more in Rap videos! Its a joke! The girls are all real light, small chests and some butts! Thas IT! They barely show their chests! This movie is horrible!"
1,A Mindless Compilation,"I tossed my copy out. This book is a thoughtless, mediocre cut-and-paste job. Don't buy this book if you want more than homilies."
1,Way Overpriced!,"I assumed this Dewalt vacuum came with an 18V battery when I placed the order, but it does not. To operate it as a cordless vacuum you have to purchase a battery and charger at about $120 extra, which pushes the total price over $200. This is utterly ridiculous. It does however, operate just as well as any other $29 portable vacuum on the market. The dumbest purchase I have ever made."
1,"The BEST cover EVER, but 1 of my least favorites from KISS","Aside from the cover being my favorite KISS album cover EVER, Creatures of the Night is 1 of my least favorites from KISS. Don't get me wrong, the title track is a great opener and it definitely ROCKS! But the high points for me are ""I Love it Loud"" ""I Still Love You"" & my favorite from Creatures ""Killer""Even though I only give Creatures 2 stars, I still recommend it."
2,Soul of the Organs,"Both musicians on this album were great. I am more aquainted with Luis Rivera's music because he was a personal friend. Luis Rivera and his trio appeared frequently in Los Angeles in various night clubs where Isaw him preform in the sixties. He usually had a full house where ever he preformed. This album is one of the few that are left of Jazz Organ music. I encourage the purchase of this album to those who appreciateJazz Organ, especially by gifted and soulful musician's. It is a must for one's Jazz library.Naomi Clark"
1,BIG TIME BOMB,"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THRILLER WANNA BE. IT IS SLOW, BORING AND COMPLETLY UN REALISTIC. IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT PAYING MONEY FOR THSI BIG TIME BOMB THINK AGAIN."
2,Fix it and Forget it,"Great book and recipes. Once you get into the habit of using the slow cooker, you are hooked. So cool to come home and have the meal prepared and the smell of fixens all done."
1,Getting Suckered,"Yeah the game looks all nice and neat now in the concept stage,but don't forget in last sims you have to add additional versions over and over again nor to have all the stuff and don't for get the downloads on the web page. In the end it's overly priced to buy as soon as it comes out. Don't you think EA Games is going to make additions after the fact again?? Consider waiting until the first 3 or 4 expansions for sims2 come out before buying it and getting suckered again with lower prices later."
2,Marshall Tucker at their best live.....,"Unbelieveable that this album was held back and never released in 1977. What a gem. I grew up and still live in South Carolina. I've seen the band and various members play in many different locale in the 1970's. I'm normally not a fan of ""live"" albums, but this may be one of the best recorded ever and at various locations. Toy Caldwell, the lead guitarist who never used a pick only his thumb, is at his very best playing blazing Southern rock runs.If your an old fan of MTB you have to add this to your collection. If your a fan of Southern rock or the Capricorn record artists you have to add this to your collection. If your not a fan give it a listen. You'll wanta do a little chicken pickin'."
2,production value high,"i only like trance mixes if they ""flow"" and this one does it. buy it, you won't be sorry."
2,SOUNDS GREAT,"I dont have one yet, but i think it sounds like a great deal. i have been looking for one of these with a nice price for a while now, and i think it is cool on the inside and how it looks like a cd player and that it can hear up to 30 feet away. I only have one question though, can it hear through walls? even though it is a pretty affordable price, i think it sounds like it works great with the word from the reviews, with the exception of it being hard to hear upstairs when your down. overall it sounds cool. cant wait to get one!"
1,Don't Bother,A bit disturbing...not the story...the directing and most acting. I thought the cast was very easy on the eyes (hence the two stars and not just one) but the story was distracting and was written like a 70's porno (all you need is a theme and a title) but without the sex. I would recommend you pass on this one.
1,Bad Purchase,"I got this item in January 2008 and in less than a year it started to give problems. I kinda just forgot about it and moved on without coming back to Amazon, but I think other customers should know what to experience. The end of the adapter which is plugged into the computer started to give problems in terms of not charging. I had to wedge it against the wall or books in order for it to work until I just gave up. This was my second charger. Since then I tried a Generic charger which worked for a while. I just bought another one today but hope I get the best out of it. If I do, or don't I will share my reviews.As for this adapter however, I STRONGLY recommend that you not buy it."
2,Math Made Easy - Great Content,"I ordered these for my kids to work on over the summer, so they wouldn't lose ground on their math knowledge. We have been very happy with the contents. HOWEVER, the pages are slick and difficult to write on. It's very hard to use pencil on the pages. I ended up buying fine-tipped Sharpie markers for the kids to use in the books. They are ""special pens"" they can only use in their math books, so it's a good incentive for them to do math, actually."
2,Funny and silly,"I read this book to a group of preschool children at storytime at our local Zoo. When I first read it to myself, I thought it was a rather silly book, but the children thought it was wonderful and couldn't stop laughing. I would recommend it."
2,Loved this!,"I don't know how I never heard of this movie. It is fantastic. It keep me on the edge of my seat. The acting is really good (imho). Dakota Fanning shines. Theron rocks her part and who knew Courtney Love can actually act. Stuart Townsend make a good doctor and Kevin Bacon, Well it's kevin bacon I need say no more. If you like suspense and action you should give this a try."
2,Great comedy,"As a fan of faantasy and Tony Randall, I can honestly say that this was one of his better movies because he has the lead role. I truly enjoyed the whole ""genie in a bottle"" theme and the fact that Tony plays alongside Barbara Eden. It was funny and endearing. Tony at his best!"
2,Remember from my childhood,"I love this book. Not just because I used to love making cookies with my mom years ago, but the variety of cookies make this book one of the best. Highly recommended."
2,The Secret.......,This is a very interesting book and DVD. Putting it into practice is hard. Still working with it.
2,A different kind of thriller,"Okay so the majority of critics didn't really go for this one. Why? Cause it's different. This isn't a slam-bang action Brukhiemer film, nor is it an suspenseful-scary thriller. The film tries to be both in a way at once. It is sort of a stylish representation of an audience looking through a hidden camara. The audience acts as a jury by being expsed to all different views of different people that all converge in one situation. I think people watched it hoping for action ,they didn't get it, it's action not just the type like Con-air and the Rock, people wanted suspense, but this aint no teen-horror flick. This is a crime-thriller that throws in brilliant camara work and acting. This movie is pretty good. Forget that what the critics said, watch it and don't expect BOOM!!! Rat-tat-tat!!!!!Hasta-vista-baby. The movie is finely executed , but was seriously overlooked by audience and critics alike. Don't make the same mistake."
2,Entertaining,I hadn't heard anything about this movie before I watched it and I was entertained and surprised. I enjoyed it.
2,No PAIN...,"Well, sadly i have to use it on my face. But here's the good news, unlike other wax products this one does not hurt.. i mean after you use the strip..no other product has to be applied to kill the pain.. As I use the ""moom"" stuff more i've gotten better at getting the results i desire.THIN LAYER..is a tip"
2,Everything you need to know.,This book fully prepared me for the GED. I had to study everything for highschool and this book covered it all and then some. I passed with flying colors. Recommend for anyone and everyone preparing to take the GED test.
2,I love Willie.,I may wear out the CD just by playing it while in the car. The lyrics are so amusing and just fit the two singers and their life style.
1,Formula 405 AHA Cream -- Yuck!,This was an early experiment in alpha hydroxy acid. It severely burned my skin and turned it a deep red within a minute of applying. Stick with the traditional Formula 405 Enriched Face Cream. It's great!
2,an architects #1,As an architect i am always on the look out for top quality design/function products.But i did go over-the-topo w/ 15 bags of concrete!
1,BEWARE!! No support or repairs after warranty expires,"Nice when working, but BEWARE! After our 380 failed out of warranty, our only option was to buy a new unit for $375 + shipping. That's only a 5%-20% discount off of their regular to sale price. Horrible! They do NOT repair their products or provide refurbished machines for reasonable prices. They do NOT sell spare parts. They do not sell extended warranties. Apparently, their customer service hears these complaints a lot and management will not change their policies. They do NOT care about their customers. They only want to screw customers into buying a new unit.Imagine buying a new car and when the car breaks down shortly after the warranty is over, you need to buy a new car. No parts and no repairs!!! HORRIBLE!!!These units break down a lot!!! This is our forth unit. Luckily, the previous three units failed under warranty!Stay away!"
1,"Great Company, so-so slippers","Great company. They were very nice on the phone and I had no trouble returning this product and getting my money back. The slipper was nice except for a very uncomfortable elastic band that goes across the instep on the inside of the shoe. My wife tried to be nice since it was a gift, but couldn't get used to the feel so I returned them."
1,Dangerous Product!!!,"I purchased the Vtech 2421 as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. It worked for 3 days and then stopped. She then let it charge for 24 hours before attempting to use it again and when she tried, it was so overheated the handset just about burned her hand! I returned the product. Only wish there was a 0-star rating."
1,Battletoads review,"THIS SHOWS STINKS TO THE 25th POWER. A lame attempt to cash in on fame of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show. The cast & the villains are bland & cliche. Even more then Batman & Robin if you can belive that. The action is silly & childish. Even The Carebears Movie had better action then this. The lines & battle cries like ""Let's get Worty"",""Cosma-riffic"" & ""psychotronic"" are dumb and made me wish for the jokes from Milton The Monster. The story is luke-warm at best. I seen better stories on TNA Impact. The animation is choppy ala Pound Puppies:The Legend of Big Paw. The music sounds like it came form the 50's instead of the 90's. The ending is a rip-off because no network in their right mind pick this crud up as a regular series. Overall:If you ever see this tape,BURN IT!!!I gvie this tape a 0 out of 10."
1,Crap!,Wow this is an extremely low budget movie with bad acting. Just another slasher movie with typical plots. I mean how many times has this type of movie been made with young teenagers drinking and doing drugs with a maniac killer after them. Don't waste your time.
1,Disappointed,I was really disappointed. There was no detailed movements. Too much talk with roughly movements. It was a waste of time and money. I'm not sure it is helpful even to the biginner.
1,Sony CLIE PEG-TJ35/U from Tech for Less,"I recently returned my reboxed Sony CLIE PEG-TJ35/U from Tech for Less. PalmOS 5.1 caused some of my repair tracking programs to not work so I returned it within four days. Tech for Less charges a 20% restocking fee; fair enough but I asked to defer that until I can research which older Palm OS will work.It seems that PalmOS 4.1 works with my program but now Tech For Less says that I had to take store credit at the time so no deal on credit the $19 that they charged for restocking fee towards a older Sony Clie PEG-T665C.Oh well, they loose and another seller on Amazon .com got my business."
1,My hopes dashed,"I had high hopes for the Kensington iPod FM transmitter and I was very excited when it arrived. Alas, my hopes were dashed when I tried it out and checked its reception on each of the eight positions that this product allows. On each there is constant interference, poor sound and often, complete loss of the signal. It was unusable. I should mention that I live in a large city and there is probably a lot of congestion on the FM radio, but there wasn't any position that delivered even mediocre quality. Guess, I'll have to continue breaking the law and listen to my iPod through headphones while driving....."
2,A Hit!!,"I'm impressed with this toy. It's all-wood construction. Very smooth, well-sanded, no sharp edges. Hit the rubber spot with the mallet, and the ball rises up and out of the tower, rolls around the tower on the colored ""walls"", and rolls back into the base of the tower, ready to be hit again. The very young will enjoy the repetition (no batteries required!). The slightly older (in our house, at least) enjoy testing various ""tricks"", such as what happens if I hit it harder? lighter? at the edge of the lever arm instead of on the red dot? etc. We found it to be enjoyable for all ages. I appreciate the solid construction. It's very sturdy, bottom-heavy (nice) and quite lovely wood grains, too."
2,Yummy snack and supplement of iodine for women's health,"A food that is widely eaten by a nation that has the lowest rate of diseases, and with the iodine this really helps women's health: especially for those who have low energy and can't shake the fat? Sounds familiar. Besides all the health benefits, these actually are really yummy for all the brands I have tasted and relatively low In sodium too. Love.One wish is that they make the packaging a little less as I am very concerned about the environment!Purchased in early January; expiration date was early November of same year. Cool."
2,Wonderfully Original,"The Great Good Thing is a wonderful book! It has a charming and original plot. It's not like most princess story; it's about a princess who lives in a book and acts out her part with the other characters.In The Great Good Thing, Princess Sylvie's book hasn't been read for so long that everything is getting dull, but one day a reader appears. From then on, Sylvie goes on many adventures through her book and through a reader's dream. As Sylvie travels through her reader's mind, she finds people, or memories of people, who are rusting from disuse. She has to help them!The Great Good Thing is captivating. It has a great idea, great characters and plots, and was every bit a good book!"
2,JUST UNFORGETTABLES SONGS !,It is realy the best of Paralamas. Has songs that make us to remember the best times of this band in Brazil!
1,Do NOT buy this camera,"My wife and I own a digital camera already, but she needed a point-and-shoot for a class she's taking. We got this camera, and after just a couple of months, it quit working. The camera comes on, and we can do everything (review pics, zoom, change menu settings) EXCEPT take a picture. When we push the shutter button, the camera turns off. After searching the web for a solution, I've discovered that many people have this problem, there is no apparent solution, and no information forthcoming from Fuji.Don't take my word for it, check out this ""find help here"" site.[...]"
2,Another Carr puzzle for Dr. Gideon Fell fans,"I have many Carr/Dickson paperbacks, but the type is so small! How wonderful it is to have some of his work available on Kindle!This book a good example of the mysteries of John Dickson Carr/Carter Dickson. A shot rings out in the night, but nobody is with the victim. Dr. Gideon Fell is on hand, though, and he sees through the mystery in time to save a life.Highly recommended for Carr/Dickson fans!"
2,"Wow...Vinnie (Michael) could have had everything, but.....","Really the story of greed, power and control and put in an excellent genre to understand what happens in Hollywood. It's rather a sad story because you can't help liking Michael Vincent, and you see his every mistake wishing he hadn't chosen that direction. But what a story! I enjoyed this book and the story of a brilliant man with no morals."
2,A wonderful reference book that searches the souls of many.,"I throughly enjoy this book on a daily basis. It has extreme quotations from a wide variety of interesting and exciting people from the past and present.I have learned that even though you might not agree with what everyone says, that people are entitled to their opinion, and that is why we as a people are so lucky to have freedom.I highly recommend this book to people of all ages. It will keep you entertained and it is a wonderful way to get to know yourself in the process."
2,Awesome toy,Bought this to replace our homemade version and what a difference. Worth every penny. My husband did attach a rope so our 5yr old could ride it as well as our 8yr old. It's been a great addition to our backyard.
1,rebate not honored,"I was disappointed that ""Viking"" would not honor the rebate as they said I did not send the UPC code from the package. I felt that I sent all they needed with the Amazon bill? I sent the cut out from the wrapping with a UPC code?"
1,"Sorry, I couldn't give it 0 stars","Graphics: Are something to be desired. Think glitchy blocks for player models who can't move their mouth when they talk. Look at Unreal Tournament made YEARS before this sniper game yet graphics are superior.Sound: Nothing special.Gameplay: This is one of those horrible 'set' games. By that, I mean there is no variation in the storyline. No matter what you say in reply to people in this game, they always give the same answer, adding no variation to the storyline. Ending is pretty bad too.Worth It?: No. If you could download it from the Internet, might not be so bad, but if you are intending to spend any amount of money on this game, you are crazy. I was lucky, because I bought it for $$$ and sold it for $$$."
2,ok.,"While ""containing"" the Hit song:I'd Love To Change The World;;I'm NOT ""impressed"" by That song ANYMORE.(It 'wanders"" ALL Over The Place; first Alvin is singing: I'd Love To Change The World, then he sings: I Don't Know What To Do so I'll Leave It Up To You. Then ""he rethinks his position"" and starts giving Advice/Suggestions. Aaaagh! MAKE ""up Your MIND, Alvin!!"")Other songs (except One Of These Days) ARE ""better""."
2,Be Patient,"This man is a genius! I'm not a scientist of any sort, but this man in all his enthusiasm broke some fascinating findings in laman's terms. To be honest I was expecting a little more visually. It wasn't until I let go of my expectation that I began to appreciate all of the fun facts provided. If you have any interest in where you come from and where you are and what the ancients all over the world knew, you will want to see this!"
1,Keep Looking,"I've had this laptop for a little over a year and I wish I had saved my $1500. I've never written a review on Amazon, but after it finally croaked completely I felt obligated to.When I first received this computer, it didn't work. I had to contact HP to order recovery disks. After running the disks the computer did run.About a month ago, the screen would begin to go black and freeze periodically. Again, this laptop is a little over a year old. The screen issue began to be more frequent. I took it to an HP service provider. He told me the hard drive may need to be replaced ($200 parts & labor) or the mother-board would need to be replaced (approx $800 parts & labor). I went the cheaper route and guess what - it didn't fix the issue. So, since I am not forking over another $800, the laptop is junked.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING"
1,Virtually Unreadable,"The clumsy use of language caused me such acute pain, that even though I love the subject and period, I was unable to push myself on through it, even with a reasonable distraction, like brushing my teeth at the same time. It set my teeth on edge!"
2,"unforgettable, superb","This was one of the most memorable books I have ever read. Unfortunately, it's out of print. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, please let me know."
1,Better than Turbotax? NO,"I used TurboTax for the past two years. After reading the review about TaxCut, got fooled to buy this product.My wife has only Tax Payer ID (TIN), with that the state program didn't start to work and complained SSN is not correct! Customer service says update the latest from the website, looks like standard answer, that doesn't solve the problem. They never tested this simple thing I guess. Finally I found a workaround, enter some random SSN number for my wife and proceed to State program and then come back and change the SSN. What the heck? Then what about any complex calculations? How can you be sure that it has been tested?I crosschecked my tax calculations manually to make sure it matches before e-filing. Good news is I got the refund in 8 days, a big relief to me.I'll going back to TurboTax, no doubt."
1,Worst Book Ever,This book could have been written in Arabic for all I know. Could understand one idea.
1,Blah,"From the first chapter you can tell when a book will be worth reading or not. This one's the later. Full of dull discriptions, overused phrases, bombed with cliches. Avoid if at all possible."
1,"Big Mosley Fan, but this Didn't Work for Me","I've loved all of Mosley's Easy Rawlins mysteries (with the possible exception of ""Gone Fishin""), so I figured I'd give this new genre a shot. I couldn't wait to finish this one--so I could get rid of it! Admittedly, I'm not much of a supernatural fan, but much of this book just made no real sense to me. The plot really goes nowhere, and the violence and sex almost seem gratuitous. I wish Walter Mosley would stick to the mysteries and leave this stuff to the Stephen Kings of the world."
2,"Escellent stakes, but too expensive","I really like the design of these stakes. Their triangular design gives them strength so that they do not bend. Would be nice if they had more of a hook at the top, but they're plenty functional the way they are. They could be a bit cheaper, but I suppose they could cost a bit more too, so all in all I'm very satisfied with them, highly recommended."
1,I wanted to like this TEA,I wanted a mental boost by something else than caffeine and I was enthusiastic to love this Tea but after tasting it for the fifth time I quit. It really taste bad. I prefer the Yerba Mate from Numi. Gives you a boost as well.
2,Nice cooker,"Nice and big (for a bachelor, anyway), and works just fine. Unlike my previous cooker, the ceramic pot is easy to clean. The old one absorbed food and then oozed it out forever. Gak. My use of it is limited to soups and stews, which it cooks just fine. Being a vegan, I can't comment on how it works with pig snouts or cow brains."
1,Dont buy!!,"This is the worst kitchen aid appliance Ive ever owned, coffee is never hot enough, over flose, coffee grinds everywhere and leaks. Ive always bought Kitchenaid appliances however Iam now done with them although six months ago I purchased a high end gas stove that is kitchenaid now Iam worried about that.My coffee maker lasted almost two years now today the coffee maker reads error2 I call kitchen aid and Jessica says to unplug the machine and if that doesnt work (in which it did not) its the warming plate and there is nothing to be done for it. Iam buying a NEW ONE TODAY not kitchen aid I ve heard Mr. coffee makes the best maybe Ill try the cheaper brands this time and maybe high end appliances are just that your paying for the brand not how good the product really is"
1,VHS-Really you still sell these?,"I ordered this as a gift and by the picture it looks like all the DVD's I've ordered in the past. In fact, I've never ordered a VHS tape from Amazon.I can't believe I sent a gift of a VHS tape. How embarrassing for me and Amazon that they still sell these.BAD BAD BAD BAD Experience."
1,I was expecting more,"Not very good descriptions and sketches, there is a lot of information missing so to name it complete guide compared to older books. It is the first glimpse into the matter for novices."
1,disappointed,"it didn't fit my dryer, even though the description said it should. Since it was only a few bucks I didn't want to waste anymore money returning it so I just throw it in the junk drawer, maybe it will come in handy someday. I did find that a night light bulb works in my dryer and I got 4 of those for the same price."
2,another jewel from René Marie,"I've seen René Marie performing live in Paris at the end of October (2001). She was awesome! She blew away the audience! Though a studio CD can't capture the live atmosphere, you will anyway be amazed by what she can do on this record, as well as her first CD ""How Can I Keep From Singing?""... Slow, fast, with a precise pronunciation, a huge sense of musicality, she takes chances for the pleasure of our ears... She's great on standards that she makes her own, and I would advise to listen closely to her three compositions on this album, especially the title song ""Vertigo"" : you won't believe a singers can pen something like this today! René is the top!"
1,Lousy customer service and bad product,"The DVD player was defective. Called their customer service and they offered to replace it. After shipping the item to them it was impossible to get in contact with them. I emailed them (at all their listed email addresses) multiple times. I also tried calling them at their listed number. No one ever picked up their phone and the voicemail I got routed to was always full and would not let me leave a message.After three weeks of trying to contact them, I used the A-Z gaurantee from Amazon to get a refund."
2,"great product, I will have no problem being seen now",It does both solid light and blinking light and it pretty bright too I have no doubt that I will be seen on dark streets with this on my bike
2,Boy Hits Car ~ Awesome Live too!,"I heard about this band through a friend, and he and I went to see them...they rock! The CD is the best, listened to it the whole way through at least twice, and was always entertained. My favorite song is ""everything"", but the whole CD rocks!"
1,Infantry Aces,"This book is one-sided and doesn't say anything about the person, the German Soldier. It is a list of accomplishments, although the bravery was outstanding, there is nothing about the individual."
1,Does not work in big cities,"I used this in Chicago and it was hopeless. It could not identify where I was and kept ""recalculating"" even though I was not moving. It kept receiving mixed signals and though I was right in front of my destination, it kept telling me to go round and round. The suction cup that came with the unit did not work and will afix to the windshield. It was a good thing that I had a friend and a map with me on that day. Do not buy!"
2,the real thing,"i was a bill withers fan back from the late 70's (ok i'm dating myself) i was introduced to him when 'just the 2 of us' came out. i loved his voice so much i combed the resale shops and found the original recording of 'lean on me' in vinyl. 'grandma's hands' was one of my favorite recordings. bill withers is one of those singers who sounds as good a cappella as he does w/ grover washington jr. (the only person i think who can come close is josh white jr. - check out his album 'i can sing a rainbow') i always loved the smooth whiskey sound of his voice evident in 'lean on me', 'just the two of us', 'grandma's hands' and 'lovely day' i haven't seen the GAP commercial and really don't care to. i just will crank up my stereo and get the real thing"
2,not all fairys,"this book is fun to read but not to be taken serious the author just seems to classifa all the beings in this books as fairys when a most of them are a diffent species, plus the some of the info is way wrong"
1,Unbelievable - in a bad way,"Like many of the other reviewers, I've read all of Connelly's other books and enjoyed them all. As a tech/finance professional, the 'suspension of dibelief' that's critical for fiction was just not possible. The whole manner in which technology was addressed, company buliding described, wealth thought to be created, etc. - just rang way too false. I felt I was reading the glitzed up dreams of technology and wealth created by a naive 9 year old boy.Stick with Bosch and McCaleb (Michael - why not bring Terry back for another go-round?)."
2,Great book,"i loved this book, seemed slow at times, but did not want to put it down! had a great ending."
2,Mind Control and Murder,"""Death Cult"" is part of the Crime Series published by Virgin Books. This volume is edited by Jack Sargeant, who also provides an excellent introduction to the materials contained within. The rest of the books are research papers written by many different people - each covering the history of a murderous cult. One of the best thing about this book is that it covers murderous cults outside the US/UK also (e.g. Kali's Thugs in India and Moslem Assassins) and thus giving us a very good study of this phenomenon in human history. Other chapters include studies of Jonestown, Manson Family and the Aum Supreme Truth of Japan."
1,Worst book I've ever seen,"This is without a doubt, the worst book I've ever even seen! Poor, weak content and apparently never proofread.Fortunately, Amazon has a good return policy of which I took full advantage."
1,monotony,"he managed to turn a seemingly nice blend into just over an hour of monotonous bass kicks, claps & clicks. Even though there are some good artists here, and with the exception of 2/3 tracks, the mix makes them all sound the same; it's like hearing a one hour long song. I guess it's one of those cool-to-dance-to-but-not-listening CDs (I fell asleep to it). I'd go for individual albums, or another compilation."
2,Very good,"Has a slight aroma of watermelon so it is a pleasing taste. Do not expect a ""Jolly Rancher"" type of watermelon taste, it is more of a watermelon scented apple. The kids like it but we are going back to the raspberry."
1,Very disappointed!,"Janet Evanovich fans waited a very long time for a movie to be made from her Stephanie Plum books. Well, One for The Money (the movie) is a huge disappointment. It was poorly cast, poorly directed with unenthusiastic acting, and unwatchable in my opinion."
1,Not up to No Limit's Standards,"Out of 17 tracks, only Snoop's track is any good. The next track by Mia X is the worst No Limit song yet."
2,Lots of pictures,My daughters needed to have more memory for all their pictures and these discs hold quite a bit of photos. Great price
1,"A campy, time worn relic that has not aged well","I first read Catch-22 when I was in high school in the '70s. I hated it. But throughout my life I kept bumping into people who worshiped this book as if it was a great missing chapter from the Bible. So, I recently decided to give it another try. I'm older and wiser now, I thought, so maybe I might finally ""get"" whatever it was I missed in the first reading decades ago. I should have stuck with my initial teenage impressions. This book bored me in '70s and it still bored me in the '90s. Great charactor names like... Major Major Major Major! Wow, that's really funny! Whew! This book is a stinker. I don't need Joseph Heller to tell me that war is hell. Why do you?"
2,Sennheiser PX 100 Collapsible Headphones,"These headphones are great. Lightweight, good sound quality. My only complaint would be collapsing them back up to fit back in case. Work great with my mini MP3 and I would definately buy them again."
2,Well balanced,"It will not disappoint you. Wonderfully made, undeground to the most. Smooth, high in a constant, rich, deep, flawless. There is just 1 song I didn't like, but for the price worths a lot. (...)"
1,What a hack!,"Being a Pete Tong Hater is not always easy, but it always enjoyable. It is like people that hate the BackStreet Boys, or Brittany Spears. We hate them becasue of what they represent. They are the hacks that tap into the highest peaks of cultural popularity and try to make it their own. On 2000, Tong has struck again.Like the old Ronco Greatest hits that we used to buy at Kmart when we were kids (remember all the best songs, no hidden gems) Tong does the exact same here, taking the life away from some great songs. His track listing is a Greatist Techno Hits (as he has always done) and peices them together for our listening enjoyment. To make matters even worse his mixing is not the least bit inspiring.Such current house hits like (well every track) Koochy, Time is Now, Tell me Why are throw together just so Pete can make a quick buck. Do yourself a favor, just say no, and find some techno that will challenge you, but also move you...unless N'sync really are your hero's."
2,Review,"I love Bob Dylan and so does my grandmother, the CD arrived before the estimated time. I think that the older he gets the better his music sounds."
2,Get your hands on this somehow....,"First off, ""Carolina"" is a really cool, fresh sound.If you're like me, you came to find Seu Jorge on the Life Aquatic movie. Life Aquatic featured him in a slower, stripped-down acoustic format.""Carolina"", however, features upbeat, moving, happy songs. Lots of very danceable songs. He has such a great voice that you forget that it's all sung in Portuguese.If you search around hard enough, you can probably find it somewhere else cheaper though. It's worth the import price though.It's definitely highly recommended for fans of samba, world music, and just different/unique/cool music in general."
2,Loved it.,"I was home sick in bed and watched the entire thing. It was excellent. The acting was wonderful, costumes, set design everything was excellent. If you like Dickens you will love this. I highly recommend it."
1,Not sure about weight limit,The vest is actually smaller than another vest I have that is for <30lbs. I don't know how they can state that it is for <50lbs. I wish I would have known before buying.
2,"Hogg, a wonderfully bizarre & extreme story.","Well, I first heard about Hogg via a friend, during a discussion about the Anne Rice ""Sleeping Beauty Trilogy"". If you thought SBT was extreme, nothing quite prepares you for reading Hogg. I was disgusted with the characters, but felt that he did a good job in portraying their personalities in a very direct and unapologetic way. I was fascinated by the extreme violence and sex, and by how such a story could be told in such graphic detail. It's an excellent example of story telling....but definitely not for the sexually weak of heart or sensitive."
2,5 Stars is All?????,"I'd give it more if I could...This book is fantastic. The way it is ""set-up"" is a little odd at first, but you get the hang of it quickly. The writing is beautiful, gentle, kind, I wanna say more, but you get the picture. It is definatley not the type of book for a (shall I say) non-believer in all things spiritual. It's spiritual and celtic, ""other-world"" has invoking prayers, etc. It's not hokey by any means, but if you are not open-minded you MAY think so. Someone who is ready for the right teacher to appear will be ready for this book. If this book (or author) find their way to you, consider it a blessing and read her. You'll be pleased the universe brought you together."
2,great album; must buy for everybody,"Bought this when I wanted ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" with extra tracks. There are other ""Best of"" and ""Greatest Hits"". This one is the best."
2,Sturdy and makes large Popsicles,"These are very sturdy Popsicle molds. I really liked the adult size and the durability of the product, which seems very rare for popsicle molds. Deducted 1 star for the amount of space needed in freezer & the tops do not snap in place (stay closed). Both issues was able to accommodate for and does not detract from my enjoyment of the product."
1,never wore,they didnt stick and just looked way too fake!! my husband swore it was chicken and it just makes u that much more self consious.
2,Exactly what we were looking for,"Did a lot of research looking for a small dresser/changing table combo as we are limited on space. It arrived about 1 week after ordering, packaged wonderfully, no broken pieces, and was put together smoothly in about 1 hour. Directions say not to use power tools, which my husband did, but we didn't run into any problems at all. The quality of pieces are slightly better than expected for the price, but I imagine anyone inexperienced in construction might find this assembly challenging. The drawers are good size for some baby clothes and the shelves are deep enough to hide a few things behind a cute basket to dress it up. Once assembled, it's a sturdy piece of furniture that will serve it's purpose and look cute for a great price! You won't find furniture priced like this at chain baby stores."
2,Great,"I wish, as 007, to have Miss Moneypenny transcribe this review, so that I may tell you, dear readers, that this, perhaps, was my most thrilling adventure. Skiing, impersonation, ...romance, facing my greatest nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (really a silly bloke, despite his dangerousness), gambling in Monte Carlo. It was my privilege to risk my life, and [take down] many men, for the sake of her Majesty, the Queen. I hope you enjoy the narrative of said adventure, and if you will excuse me, Miss Moneypenny is eager to make me my evening martini (shaken, not stirred.) By the way, the name is Bond. James Bond."
2,Very dependable and accurate,"I purchased the Sigma Bc906 because the Bell unit that i had installedwas very erratic. After mounting the Sigma to my motorized bike it wasvery accurate and dependable. I tested it by riding towards a roadsideradar display, and the Sigma matched the speed shown on the radar display.I did have to reprogram the wheel dimensions twice, but after that it wasright on the money! Can't beat itFred GAlpharetta, Ga"
1,Not what it seems,"Probably my fault, but I thought it was unabridged - hard to tell in the ad that it's abridged. You can't effectively abridge three books that are 13-15 hours each to 3.5 hours each. I donated it to the local library."
2,Great Product,This battery charger is great just hook it up and leave it. It keeps the battries in top condition. This item is about $20 cheeper here than in the stores!Very happy!
2,Lutheranism,"Nobody has mentioned this in the reviews I've read so I will: When many of the novel's characters are drugged into being loyal to a corporation they used to hate, they escape the need to stay loyal to the corporation by inventing ... The Protestant Reformation!That is, they convince themselves that the ""real"" corporation (or church) is an individual ideal, and not the mere organization they've been drugged into being loyal to. This is precisely the ""trick"" the original Protestants, like Luther, used to escape the emotional domination of the Catholic church.There's no doubt Egan intended this, and it makes QUARANTINE one of his best novels. It's not all science fiction, and the philosophy is as up to date as a course in modern religion.Just thought I'd mention it."
2,Funky and fantastic CD!! George Clinton rocks!!,"This is really a funky CD!! P-funk All-Stars' Generator Pop and Copycat are out of sight and funky!! This CD should help you get on the dance floor and dance to it!! IF you're a true fan of George Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars, you should get this CD 'cause it rocks!!"
2,Furlong redeems his acting ability,"I guess the point of a dramatic move with a message is to make you think and reflect when it's over. Well, this hits it dead on the screws. This is really one of the best movies I have ever seen. It moves along seamlessly with the black and white flashbacks accompanied by a beautiful score. Norton, Furlong, D'angelo, Brooks, Suplee, Gould and Balk give great performances and Tony Kaye does a marvelous job of directing. The road to the racist mindset is slightly shallow, but it is implied enough to make the leap of faith to buy into the premise of the storyline. I give this movie a 5* rating and recommend it highly. I think everyone should see it once."
2,Outrageous for the Price,"This is a spectacular DVD for the small price it sells for. It would be a special purchase at any price. The artistry is over the top for the headliners as well as the lesser known singers (who by this time must have risen to stardom in the operatic world). Great representation of many of Verdi's 28 works (really 27 with Jerusalem a revision of any earlier work). Cannot get much better than this. The introductions by the singers provides insight to the composer as well as the arias and ensembles which follow. And the price, did I mention the price. A giveaway."
2,Fantastic Listening,"Being a Richard Marx fan, this collection is just so cool. Amazon shipped it right in time for christmas. It is a must buy for any RM fan.Thimmaiah"
1,Told Before,"I've never given a book less than three stars. I just wanted to point that out and make that clear.One of the ladies in our book club brought ""The Hottest Summer Ever Known"" to the table. I saw the book - read the title - then thought about ""The Coldest Winter Ever"".The Hottest Summer Ever Known lacks originality and to be rather honest plagiarizes ""The Coldest Winter Ever"" in more ways than one could imagine.In spite of the copycat title and storyline, I must say that it conveys a message that should be ignored by no one. AIDS is real! AIDS DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE! AIDS ATTACKS THE BLACK COMMUNITY HARD! AIDS KILLS! So, rap it up and be safe.Ms. Williams, I would like to see you try again. You're an author with a conscious mind, which is good. You're used as a tool from God to get your point across to everyone. I love that about you and your book. My only advice would be to be original in the process. Best of luck to you.RolandaNothing BUT Page Turners Book Club"
1,What bunch of hype,Cons:Too much and too often talking between charactors.Video segments too longThird person view ( especialy from the top is annoying)I prefer fist person veiwThe Snake was great but Raiden was some kind of transsexual.In the portion of the game where he is stripped down and you have to actualy play the game with him running around nude with his hand covering his crotch. (...)Pros:Finaly quit playing before the game ended and went to rent a fun game.
2,The Best Buffy Companion Out There,"This is the absolute best Buffy guide out there. The book includes DETAILED episode synopsises through the sixth seaons of Buffy and the third season of Angel. Unlike the Watcher's Guide's, these synopsis's are very thorough, as are each actors profile. The book also chronicles the show from its movie beginnings, through each season, to the show's move to UPN. Each episode guide includes the writer's personal favorite moment of the episode, interesting facts, Did you notice moments, Nitpicks, and bloopers from each episode that are fun to scope out.The book also has an incredibly challenging trivia section, which prompts one to go back and watch the episodes over and over again. Also included are each actors personal websites, as well as good fansites, are included. Having bought many companion guides to this show, I personally say this is the best, for any looking to wise up on Buffy, or maybe simply to extend their Buffy collection."
1,Don't buy this if you have a Windows 2000 Operating System,"I bought this product based on excellent reviews I read in trade publications. Unfortunately, in a Windows 2000 or Windows NT operating environment, this program only runs when the user is logged on as Administrator. That means that, unless you are willing to give every member of your family all administrative privileges, which is dangerous, the program is useless. I called Microsoft technical support, and was told that ""we have received this complaint from others, too."" Their only suggestion was that I upgrade my OS to Windows XP. I am returning the product to Microsoft."
2,Spellbound,"I started out reading ""Trials of Faith"" a chapter at a time. In a couple of days, that was no longer an option. I had to finish it. It is an excellent book to give to someone that you feel you need to witness to, but are hesitant to do so. The Plan of Salvation is very plain in this book. I am looking forward to Crystal's next book"
1,Very disappointed,This publication was very disappointing. I expected much more than it had . did not hav near enough detailand explanations were very vague and incomplete.
2,Yeoww banana,All love this. Well worth spending the money for. I have bought other catnip toys from petstores and they like them for the day if that long. But all the yeoww products my cats love for months. I dont know what catnip isin them but they love it.
1,Please don't waste your money,"The rubber buds always fall out AND off of the rest of the earphones. WHY aren't they connected? The sound is good but all of the buds were gone after the first week. I emailed Philips and never heard back from them. So all in all, terrible product and terrible customer service. AVOID PHILIPS."
2,THE OC SEASON 2,i love the OC and the second season is better than the first! The episondes are much better with amazing stories! I love it i am addicted to the OC!!!
2,wake up sista's,this is a wake call for all us sista's who live by foolish rules in our youth. hopefully it can help some young girl before she makes too many wrong turns. otherwise it was a great extremely funny as well as painful.
1,A great outline for a book yet to be written,"This book concentrates too much on accounting at the expense of economics. It also gives short shrift to some of the most important concepts in airline finance today, including EETCs (enhanced equipment trust certificates). It's not bad when it comes to discussing the difference in national accounting systems, but a better source for that is Airline Business magazine's study ""Mind the GAAP"". Morrell's book is pretty rudimentary when it considers things like buy vs leases analyses.Airline finance can get reasonably involved, with all sorts of tax issues. This book barely scrapes the surface of the topic. Morrell is clearly not a practioner."
1,Sent a knock-off instead of the read deal!,"I was sent a knock-off version of the Sony Ericcson headphones. I know this for two reasons. First, I ordered this from another vendor just two weeks earlier for my phone. The headset came in and sounded great. This set sounds noticeably worse in every way. More importantly, The green logo is not on the second set as on the first and the back plate on one is already gone. This is definitely an attempt to sell the original equipment as genuine and then switching to another lower-priced item."
1,Not as good as season 1,"The story was kinda silly, plot watered down, chemistry was horrible. Really wish the writers stuck with the first season magic."
2,cleaning up,"Vacuum cleaner bags....what can i say? they're delicious. and well priced. if i am rrrreallly messy i'll reorder sooner. it was a very very simple procedure to choose, order, receive."
1,Where is the speech?????,"This home made DVD has everything except what it's suppose to have...The actual ""I have a dream speech""!! It goes right up to the moment MLK is introduced to the podium and then dissolves to him leaving!!! Don't buy unlees you want B-fotage of the event!!"
1,Fail,I bought 2. 1 started clicking 2 months into use. The other one is still working fine. The clicking one finally failed and became unreadable after about 4 months. Luckily everything was backed up. I had the (now failed) drive in an external HD cage and it seemed to get AWFULLY HOT. That might be why it failed. I have 4 other Seagate drives that I love that run cool and smooth. Heat is really a hard drives biggest enemy. Unless it is a Maxtor drive. Then the Hard Drive itself is it's biggest enemy.
1,Tea maker,"Bought this one a while ago in hope that someone has invented how to brew loose leaf tea in easy and convenient way.No, it has not been done just yet. Monies spent not wisely on this one... it's just sitting in my kitchen and rarely used, too much work with a few satisfactory results.Still brewing loose leaf old fashion way that proved to be the best -in tea pot!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE ... I HAD TROUBLE FROM DAY 1 .... CD SKIP , NOTHING WORKS RIGHT !"
2,The Lost 500 Years: What happened between the Old and New Testaments,Helps fill in some of the gaps in a nice way.
2,Beautiful Dangle Earrings,I love my Swarovski Cube Crystal earrings. They're very pretty and I get compliments on them whenever I wear them.
2,Marian Visitations,"This subject has always fascinated me, and whenever I'mtempted to be sceptical I remember the following: Thecommonest mistake we all make is to believe that the limitsof our powers of perception are also the limits of all thatthere is to be percieved. And I, myself, have had an exper-ience of Mary that is beyond doubt. Though I always wonderwhy she appears only to children (who have little power toaffect world events). Why not appear at the United Nations?Or to President Bush? The book, I thought was well written, and sincere and logical."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Ordered product. Received in appropriate amount of time. However, camera did not work with our home wireless system. Went to return and there was no paperwork with information on whom to return product. The only paperwork came from a PC UNIVERSE who resold product. Contacted them several times. Spoke with Curt and Jose whom were both UNHELPFUL and rather rude. They stated I had to wait to receive an email from the manufacturer. AFter 3 weeks, I received an Email from PC UNIVERSE that stated that my request for return had been denied!! So I am stuck with a $250.00 camera. Go to Target or Best Buy DO NOT USE PC UNIVERSE. I am also going to print this on Angela's List.Stephen Marinella"
2,"As good, if not better, than the first","I am continually impressed with George R R Martin. I never thought he would suck me into his world...and a marvelous world it is, to! I've never read a fantasy series where you can truly identify and root for one of the ""villains"", nor have I read another work where realism and fantasy are blended so well. I will definately be buying the third installment."
1,waste of money,"i got this product because it was suppose to be a housing with everything include, it is actually a cover, something that you can buy in a different web site for no more than $4.00. Got full housing with tool from ebay for $14.00 ( the same amount of money that i waste here for a simple cover), recomend don't buy it."
1,too hard,I was expecting this game to be easy but it wasnt ' i think sonic team at least shouldve added a handicapp mode on story mode where it gets easy but instead they didnt ' the levels are just to hard and annyoying and walkthroughs make it sound like the game is easy when its not
1,Just Say NO,I should have read the reviews closer myself before buying this....mine just inexplicably quit working after only having it a few months. Dont buy this piece of junk...there is a reason it is priced cheap.
1,The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD:,"I was very disappointed. It was extremely repetitive, and probably could have been cut to 1 CD instead of 4. I believe a professional would have done a much better job of narrating and I found the male voice to be very close to monotone and extremely difficult to listen to, taking away from the content."
2,Salvatore always leaves you wanting more....,"The Silent Blade is classic. I am beginning to wonder if Salvatore can write a book with a neat, tidy ending, or if he just doesn't want to. The fact that Drizzt gave anything with sentient powers to Regis on a boat is just plain crazy. Also, is this rogue guy a doppleganger? Finally, will there be another book, or will we be left hanging? I think your average fantasy novel fan would prefer closure, but are any fantasy novel fans normal???? Finally, I think the whole apathy theme spills over into every part of the book, even the fight scenes. Don't get me wrong, I totally recommend this, but be warned, I am a tsr/forgotten realms novel addict. :)"
2,Bad for Children,"This film contains language and sexual content. Robin Williams uses profanity and parental discretion is advised. It is a funny telling of the story for adults but not younger viewers... Parents should watch the movie first to decide if it is appropiate for their children, and trust me, it isn't!!!!"
2,Super Reader,"David, the book's protagonist, is a telepath of no mean ability.Now middle-aged, it seems he is starting to lose his powers, and they will no longer be able to tell him what women are thinking, help him win fights, or accomplish other tasks beyond the means of most people.So, the theme here is can a superhuman deal with becoming an ordinary mortal and adjust to a different life. Quite different as looking at things that way hasn't been done in many books I can think of, as the major element of the story."
1,Disappointed,"Having just read Vanishing Florida by David T. Warner, I was anticipating another look into a native's perspective of old Florida. While Warner's book was engaging, enlightening and entertaining, this one was not. It was mostly a dry historical perspective of the author's family which wasn't that interesting."
2,Good Textbook,"I had to buy this textbook for a statistical methods in psychology class and, although it was difficult to read at times, I was able to understand the material. The book was in good condition, almost new when I got it, but the shipping took a bit longer than anticipated and I had to call the company to get things sorted out. But, since then, it's been a great book and very useful!"
2,Delicious night time snack favorite,Perfection in every bite! And I know I don't have to worry about weird chemicals or compromising health issues.
1,32 led flashlight,"I dont recommend this flashlight, it is a push button to turn it ON. you have to maintain the button pushed so it stays ON. or you can turn the nob at the back to maintain it on, after some use you have to hit it on your hand a couple of times for it to come ON.Magnificent 32 Ultimate LED Flashlight (32 LED)"
2,Recovery Meditations,"Eric points out in short, concisely written meditations the many slippery places, things and people that I have become addicted to or that trigger my relapses. In my case, isn't wanting more money, bigger homes, nicer cars... a good thing? When do I have enough? When am I ok? Mr. Greene asks me examine this.I meet my addictions on page after page. Sometimes laughing, sometimes crying, somtimes raging and sometimes denying! But everytime I react strongly, Eric asks me examine the issue with strength, courage and honesty.I recommend Mr. Greene's book for all recovery addicts who want more then cessation of our obsession and seek serenity and joy."
2,Jennifer Holliday the Diva come back.,A great song from Dreamgirls. A new dance version from the hit. Absolutelly fantastic.
1,Watching Paint Dry,This is probably one of the most boring and uneventful novels I have ever read. Most of it seems to be centred around Camden Town in London where the main character lives and doesn't really move away from there. Getting through the first 150 pages was dreadful and I gave up in the end. This is my first Gibson book - and probably my last!
1,No good...,"Being a fan of Diane Lane, usually I watch her films. This one promised to be a generallly entertaining thriller, the more so if you add the presence of ((each day uglier) Mickey Rourke and Thomas Jane, an actor I think deserved better fortunes (by that I mean better roles) in the movie business.But guess what? I was wrong. This is not a good movie. It's technically efficient, I guess. But it's so full of plot holes, lack of interesting characters, lazy acting... well, the list goes on and on. The actor who plays Rourke's side kick gives such an over the top performance that seldom I've seen such annoying performance.Anyway, since the movie is relatively short (95 minutes), you probably have a chance of not getting too mad after watching it..."
2,Good camera,Bought this camera to stay in touch with frends and family in the UK. Worked as advertised and at a good price. The software is basic but not really that important since all I care about is having the driver loaded. Works perfect on Skype. I recommend this product if you are lookng for a web cam and dont want to spend to much.
2,One of the Greatest,Nas reaches deep into his soul and this album embodies his inner voice. 'The Message' is a very powerful track.
1,Zyliss Soft Skin Peeler,I am disappointed in the product. Maybe I don't know exactly how to use the peeler. I will continue to try.
1,Not as good as they used to be?,"I wear the same size shoes as my sister in law. When I borrowed her Sanuk sandals I *had* to get some for myself they were so comfortable. The Sanuk sandals that I received seem to have been made out of a different material, they just were not as comfortable. The biggest problem is that they were smaller. I had my sister in law bring hers over and set them sole to sole, the ones I received in the same exact size were smaller, most noticeably narrower. The strap was also not as roomy or comfortable. I returned these sandals."
2,great memories,I use to watch this film as a child and now I can enjoy it with my own children. I love it.
2,great song information.,"This book contains a great analyzation of All of the songs on nirvana cds, this is mostly the authors opinion but it sounds mostly right... END"
2,One of the greatest books of all time,"I have read this book over one hundred times, no kidding! This is one of the finest literary and illustrative works ever made. The anticipation and excitement of the page where George lets the pigs out will make your kids squeal with delight!"
2,Adidas Elite Medium,"adidas Elite Team Medium DuffelBoth the Adidas Elite Medium and Large are excellent, well made bags with better dimensions than most bags. Medium is great for B-ball and the large for football. Wears well. Best bag I have owned."
2,Excellent movie,"All the performances are very good. To mention a few, Raveena Tandon is fantastic and plays her part with sheer ease in a very natural way (Mahima Chaudhry was the earlier choice for the part). Vijay Raaj, Aman Verma and Divya Dutta are excellent. Sanjay Navrekar is simply hilarious. Namrata Shirodkar does very well. Ditto for Rinke Khanna and Dia Mirza. This is probably Shweta Menon's best role to date and she does full justice to her part. Sushmita Sen shines with her contagious laughter. Sachin Khedekar is good.On a more serious note, the film does help us to appreciate the chawl dwellers. Known as middle class people, they are the hard workers, they're the ones who keep the country going, who vote, who suffer the most during conflicts e.g. political, they're the ones who sacrifice, they are strong, they are brave, and to say the least, they are survivors. Thanks to Jha and Manjrekar for making this film and giving us a relevant message through laughter."
1,not very good,There isn't much to this item. It is flimsy and supplies no structural stability to improving posture. Be leery of cheap items in the future and those that prey on those who choose cheaply.
2,A great expansion the article in Yankee by the same author,"This book is an expanded telling of the story Mr. Howe wrote for Yankee. I climbed Mt. Washington shortly after the original story. I went better prepared for the weather, thanks to Mr. Howe, and was able to assist a member of our climbing party to the ""lake of the clouds"" AMC hut (with the help of the hut staff and a cell phone). The fog seemed more like a dark blanket that shrunk the world to a few yards. A mile seemed like hundreds stopping every few feet while a fellow with a heart problem stopped to rest. After reading the original article I never considered leaving the man behind. I only wondered if he would be added to the list of those who died. I awaited this book for a few years. I met Mr. Howe at the Capitol City Dinner in Concord, NH after reading the Yankee article. Thank you sir for a great read. Thank you also for the stories that convinced me to better prepare for Mt. Washington. You may have saved a life perhaps two."
2,Another Great Book from Michael Lewis,"I am reading his latest book ""The Big Short"" and I am making myself only read one chapter at a time. His books are just the right amount of information and storytelling. He is the Dan Brown of non-fiction in that way. The Blind Side unfortunately, like Dan Brown's books, was chopped up into a movie by a screenwriter. People tend to only remember the dumbed down version. But if the movie has not ruined it for you (I watched the movie and it looked like a made-for-tv movie) you should either add this to your Michael Lewis collection,or start with this book or MoneyBall. And then read The Big Short, but don't tell me the ending :)"
1,Save your money!,"This machine [[ASIN:B00004SPDH CucinaPro 177 Pasta Fresh Pasta Machine] is made in China, it is junk. It broke after using it the first time. It is light weight and cheaply made. Save your money and time and do not buy this machine! The worst part is that I brought it to S. America so there is no way to return it...."
2,Good Listening,"This is a great CD for almost any age, as the name denotes. Great combination of upbeat and easy listening. Bought this as a gift for my 43 year-old, young-at-heart sister, and she loves is."
1,"Some benefits for mobile professionals, but very high risk","I used a demo version and was satisfied enough to buy it. That's when my problems started: the software corrupted and proved impossible to uninstall, even after having my system administrators edit my registry...When the software worked it was handy and the basic idea is great, but using it nearly destroyed my system. It took me about 50 hours of tech support, personal time, and system admin support just to restore my laptop to full operation and I still haven't been able to get all of this software off of my system."
1,Get another model,"I've literally gone through three Sportster3 and its a lousy peace of equipment. I used the home kit and it works fine for a few weeks then the receiver won't power on. Add to this the long procedure of calling Sirius warranty apart from the agony of them shipping wrong items or missing accessories. After regularily spending that much time, effort and money it gets to the point when you tell yourself ""to hell with satellite radio""."
1,"Boring, but instigating","I think that PKD is the most fantastic sfi-fi writer I've ever read. Notwithstanding, after reading masterpieces from him such as Divine Invasion, UBIK and others, I must say that I was pretty disappointed with VALIS. First of all, the book's first 120 pages are extremely redundant, with a collection of loose thoughts splashed and repeated ad nauseam. The things only heat after Dick's friend Kevin takes him to see the movie Valis. If you can reach this part (and many people couldn't), you will get some PKD's flavor. Some very interesting points are posed by him, what provoked on me a lot of reflection about life, religion. After reaching the end of the book I kept the impression that something was still missing and that costed VALIS the third star."
1,"Not a Very Good Book, 1/2 star at Best","I thought that ""Wizard's First Rule"" was an instant classic along with the other two previous books in the series. Unfortunately, this book is sorely lacking in anything remotely resembling a plot. Goodkind wrote the first half of the book with Kahlan and Cara arguing about who wanted to protect Richard more! It was ridiculous. Also, Richard was an extremely interesting and even remarkable character in the first three books, but in ""Temple,"" Richard is annoying at best. Zedd and Nathan, argueably teh two most interesting characters in this book are completely forgotten at times. Throwing Darken Rahl back into the series was just stupid because we have seen enough of him. Jagang is not very frightening. The whole book is about getting into a temple in which we don't see anything interesting happen, and stopping a plague. This book is a waste of time."
1,Too much nonsense,I will not be reading the rest of this book. Has this guy ever even MET a real Policeman?
1,Put me to sleep,Within 15 minutes I was dozing...looked over and my husband was asleep as well. Very boring - turned it off.
1,not very reliable,"I brought this in Dec 2009, it worked for about 8 months then it started to not working. I changed new batteries twice and still nothing works. I never dropped it and it is only use twice a day. It is a disappointment and it is now sitting on the table doing nothing. I don't recommend this at all."
2,Luxury Apts of NYC,I gave this book as a Christmas present to my sister who loves architecture and interior design and she was thrilled with it. I liked it as a former New Yorker -- not that I ever lived in such style.
1,For Kids only,"I thought this DVD would help me with american sign language as I am a beginner. I felt like a child as I watched the illustrations. I couldn't quite understand the zoo stuff. It did teach some words but not enough, way to much focus on the field trips."
1,Over over overdone,Totally overdone. In which India do people live like that? Now or ever? The exaggeration is embarassing. Why aren't Indian filmakers able to make anything even mildly interesting? This is three hours worth of drivel.
