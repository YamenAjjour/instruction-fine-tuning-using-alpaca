rating,title,review
1,The Family Stone,"I completely agree with all the other reviews. What a disappointment. All the music is instrumental, it isn't the fun music from the movie."
2,Complete Poems by Charles Baudelaire,"I purchased this book just for one poem; ""FLEURS DU MAL, or ""Flowers of Evil"". Mostly from a inspired song I heard by Sara Brightman. I can say to you, that my life would not have been complete without both. Listening to Sara singing and reading THESE poems; I have opened the door to a lifetime of wonder. I do recommend buying both, it will enrich your life."
2,Helpful,"I found this book hard to read. The print is small and there is alot of it where I think it could have maybe been condensed. Also the relationship between the writing and the pictures was not clear. I like a book that refers to the organ or part of the organ and then tells you to color it. I learn better this way. However, this is the only physiology coloring book that I could find so I was definitely able to make use of it."
1,"A novelty to own, at best","This film is often billed as the ""lost"" View Askew film. Despite the production credit, make no mistake, this is not the kind of material you'd get from Kevin Smith.While it's kind of cool to own another movie that has all your favorite Kevin Smith alumni, this film has none of the clever dialogue or hilarity you'll be expecting. The plot is basically nil, and the entire movie seems a sad excuse to show people sitting around smoking copious amounts of weed.Jason Lee's performance is great, considering the writing he has to work with, but his then wife's performance (Carmen Lee) takes [her attitude] to a whole new level.If it's really cheap and you want it for the novelty of having the ""lost"" View Askew film, then go for it. Just don't expect to be entertained in the least."
2,NOT A CONCEPT ALBUM,"Tull is the best.However - Ian Anderson emphatically insists that ""Aqualung"" is NOT a concept album. Editorial reviewer is wrong."
2,I Loved It!,"I didn't think I was going to like it because I read the sequel first and even though I loved A Wife In Waiting I don't like series of books. Anway, I read it and I have never read anything better! That is my all time favorite book and read it over and over!"
1,Save Your Money,"There are at least four books on camping in Washington state, and I'd suggest to potential customers that this is not the best. So if you are only going to buy one, don't make it this one.Generally, there are too many errors in fact in this book. It is as if the writer spent more time reading other camping books, then wrote the book without visiting all of the places in the guide.Before buying this book, glance at the other books on camping in Washington. You'll see why this isn't the best buy."
1,Not what I was hopping for...,"I am a long time fan of Bones the TV show and and enjoyed Kathy Reichs Young Adult Virals series, so I thought I would give this book a try. It is the book that started the Temperance Brenan Series which inspired the TV show Bones. I thought I would love this but... I didn't. It was painfully slow and the information that was supposed to be compelling fell flat. The character is NOTHING like the TV character and the forensics seemed a little stale. Maybe I was just to late to join this bandwagon and had I read this 15 years ago it would seem fresh. Today, it just doesn't hold up.The Inadvertent Thief (The Thief)"
2,Love this oven.,"I purchased this oven for my camper in 2009. I absolutely love it it works great for bread, bread pudding, buiscuts, pinapple upsidedown cake, lasagna, pies and everything else I have tried. I even bring it in the house from time to time when we are having a big family dinner as an extra oven. It is great little oven and I would highly recommend this unit."
2,Star Wars Attack of the Clones,"This game is a pretty cool game because There is 11 levels play as Mace Windu, Obi Wan Kenobi , and Anakin Skywalker. I would rate the gameplay about 6 1/2 the graphics about a 8 for the Gameboy Advance. I beat the game in about 3 days but I still Play it The bad part about this game is it is very repetive but it is still pretty fun."
2,PMBOK,"This is necessary today for a project management professional. However, one should note that if one signs up to be a member of PMI, they provide a softcopy on a disk for joining."
2,This DVD is powerful!!!!,"As a huge ELP fan and first seeing them from front row center in Houston 1973, this 2 DVD set brings it all back.... By far the most comprehensive video release yet from these guys...... Sure.....I wish the edits were not there, and I wish the sound was re-engineered into 5.1, BUT..... It's still fantastic to have access to this video content (a full 4 hours and 10 minutes). The documentary is a very interesting spin on the inner turmoil that led to the breakup... By the way, Karn Evil 9/3rd Impression from Cal Jam 1974 is worth the price of the DVD alone!!"
2,Ryan's Return,I just finished reading Ryan's Return and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was interesting all of the way through and not totally predictable like so many books of this genre. I enjoyed the quirky characters and rooted for Kara and Ryan all through the story! Very good book.
2,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,EXCELLENT PRODUCT.RECOMENDED 100 %..VERY COOL AND VERY VERY CHEAPER AND BEATIFUL CALCULATOR............. THANKS FOR SELLING THIS PRODUCT......I PERSONALLY RECOMEND THIS SELLERS
2,Awesome cd.,"This cd was easily one of the best releases last year so i had to post a review. From beginning to end every song is catchy yet in your face and thats the best way to do it. The lyrics are insane, guitar work is insane, drums insane. the riff in stab.stab.stab will not leave your head believe me.100/5 stars"
2,adapter,Every real handyman/lady needs one of these adapters for their shopvacs. We received product on time & just as described.
2,Now THIS is Music!!!,"I was inspired to buy this CD after listening to ""Talk of the Nation"" on NPR doing a special on Tito Puente. I'm just a 29 year old white girl, and I had never heard this kind of music!!! And all I've got to say is, I don't know what that stuff was that I used to listen to, poetic ramblings and such, but THIS IS MUSIC. You can NOT sit still listening to it. You just have to get up and dance. I'm not a Tito Puente expert, and I don't know which album is supposed to be the best, but I happened to choose this one, and it's GOOD. I'm going to buy another Tito Puente album today! --Senta"
2,Tim McGraw,This is a great cd and a wonderful collection of his greatest hits! An amazing cd to listen to over and over again.
2,"A good book, with a well laid trap for the impatient.","The book is not only creative but follows Frank Herbert's saying of plots within plots. Vinge carries off the book well with only a few holes. My favorite part is that if someone reads the ""last page first,"" they will be traped by the ending.I thgought that this was a interesting trick, and he worked it in flawlessly. The whole ""net"" bit was a little old, but the rest of the book made up for it. A good read, and a good time."
1,The boat sank!,We put this boat on our pond yesterday. It immediatly began to take in water and it sank to the bottom. There is no way to retrieve it...not that we'd want to! Very disappointed little boy. Aren't these boats supposed to float?
2,It really works!!,"We bought one Dr. Brown bottle to test out for our 4-weeks baby, and it worked like a charm!! I can't say that Dr. Brown could 100% get rid of all the gas or colic problems, but we did notice that our baby require less burbing after eating and she usually stay more calm after eating... I'm sure that this unique bottle really works!! We also tried the Avent and other brands, but our baby didn't like them...Thanks Dr. Brown!"
2,One of my Favorites!!!,"I'm a huge fan of both Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, and this book definitely combines the best of both worlds. By both worlds, I mean Neil Gaiman's ability to make even a somewhat simple story seem twisted(in a definitely GOOD way) and Terry Pratchett's ability to write very intelligent and yet, extremely, extremely funny books."
2,"good sound quality, but cable is too short","We use this set for our VODAVI phone system. Good sound quality, but cable is too short."
2,Beautiful but...,This had a few too many fight scenes for me but it's often quite funny and visually astonishing.
1,Danger,"Like everyone else, I found the same thing. One day the unit failed to show up in explorer - and that was it. All data lost. Eventually, you're data will be lost too.Tried the ""Plug it in to a regular outlet, instead of a power strip"" thing - Nothing. The manufacturer (if you search long enough) has another solution -Go spend $200+ an hour with another company to get your data back again. YGBFSM!Short story here is that you can make the drive work again, but all data will be lost. If you have one of these, it will just be a matter of time."
1,A disappointed reader,"I had anticipated a more direct, clearly expressed and no nonsense book. I did not received what I anticipated. Tenet plays games with his readers ever as he appears to do on his TV interviews.I hear excuses, but I do not hear valid reasons for his failure to pull the plug on the president's insane drive to invade Iraq with only unverified intelligence at his disposal."
2,Can't wait to see the rest of the series!,"I thought McCaffrey wrote a very well-told story in this book. It was especially interesting to me because it was taken straight from her short story ""The Thorns of Barevi."" I had read that story in Get Off the Unicorn (which has several other wonderful short stories), and it was a joy to me to see a full novel (now 2 novels!) based on that story.The main character, Kristin, and her Catteni companion from the short story are also in the novel, although changed somewhat. The story becomes part of the first chapter of the novel.I thoroughly enjoyed Freedom's Landing, and am waiting impatiently for the next novels in the series"
2,A great game for the Pokemon mind!,"This game was, in everyway the most greatest kind of RPG on Gameboy Color! If you're a Pokemon fan then you might disagree. But this game takes you in the game and lets you solve all kinds of problems. The sounds of the game are really pretty interesting and the masters and bosses are incredible. This game will keep you satified for a long, long time! The fact of raising monsters and breeding them and combining them into different monsters justed makes you stuck to the game! This is pokemon with more drama and action! You buy items and join with allies to form a team of unbeatable creatures, cute and strong! There are a lot of cute and cuddly monsters and powerful monsters. This game is an interllectual challenge and is very indept. You will have a great experience with this wonderful game and the climax of the game is always happening! Choosing animals and training and trading has never been this interesting! What are you waiting for? Buy it already!"
1,bad hair dryer,I will not recommended this product to anyone.This product make my hair so dry and fuzzy.Since I start using this hairdryer my hair is falling.Iam really very disappointed.I hope I can returned this product and get my money back.
1,bad movie,I really hated this movie. It was really stupid. It was too unreal. The so called scary monster in the movie was not even scared. It seemed as through the movie was a cartoon. The movie was so boring I fell asleep. The only reason I did not leave out the show is because the show offered free pop. The actors in the movie did a bad job too. They did not even act as through they was scared. The movie did not even have a good story line.
2,Journey has Arrived,"GREAT CD !! In my opinion, this is one of there best.. The lyrics are shakey in a few songs but musicly, this ranks 10 out of a 10. Some people might refuse to buy this because Steve Perry is not on it, but the new ""Steve"" sounds just like him with a little bit of his own style as well. Trust me, I was surprised at how much I loved this cd. Buy It!!!"
1,Not....what I expected...,"So I purchased these bows for my female maltese, being that she has long hair and I try to keep it out of her eyes...and for once I decided to use something pretty instead of regular black hair bands....MISTAKE. These bows are made in a strange way, the way the band is attached will leave the bow sideways....impossible to straighten them out. And the elastic is very stiff and will not stretch...which makes an already hard job even harder. When I did managed to get them in (crooked) they lasted about ten minutes...and then fell apart.....This being a dog that wears a sweater constantly and never pulls at it....the tiny beads are glued on and my pup promptly ate one of them, and while you should receive two of each color you will receive about four or five that do not match whatsoever....I would not buy these again."
1,"Well, I'll admit that I purchased the thing used...",Maybe I'm cynical...but a movie about three college students going out into some woods and yelling at each oher? This is entertainment?
1,Try other Amazon books on wicca,"The spells do not work. Furthermore, it is unethical to cast ""revenge"" spells...and don't be fooled by the title, there is no actual spell here that tells how to turn anyone into a toad."
2,PHENOMENAL!,"This was the first book I read of the Ballad Mysteries by Sharyn McCrumb - I was a little out of order. I could not put it down the entire time I read it - even on vacation. I then quickly read the other four books. I read the first and fifth book last, which was, I think, appropriate since they were the weakest of the bunch. Those two did not hold on to the eery spirituality the other three did. However, I look forward to more Ballad mysteries. They are astoundingly wonderful! They remind me so much of both the ballads I listened to as a child and the family stories I've heard of my own backwoods ancestors. Great stuff!"
2,Fun and frothy rom-com mystery,"Having spent a little time in such a small town Iowa town, this book brought a smile to my face as I read it. The ""calamities"" the lead character experienced seemed a little much at times, but overall I liked this pleasant novel"
2,A very suspenseful Season,The 9th Season was filled with suspense and variety giving us a bit of the history behind every character. It was a very good season!
2,Strato lives on...Sort of,"While Stratovarius is still trying to make an existnecve with some sort of female vocalist (wow, they're really changing huh?) The Stratovarius we all knew and loved can still live on with Kotipelto, the solo band by Timo Kotipelto. There isn't really much difference between this band and Stratovarius, with the exception of the name. It's still the same prog power metal and Timo's soaring higher vocals that sort of remind me of rush. If you liked Strat, you'll like this."
1,Don't Take the Chance!,"I purchased this card so my mother could use it on a trip to Alaska. It worked for exactly 2 weeks; up until the day she arrived home. According to the data recovery company I sent it to, it short circuited. The images could never be recovered. Although SimpleTech replaced it, it was not worth the frustration and loss of once-in-a-lifetime pictures. I am now using the replacement card but it seems to write slower than my other cards and, frankly, I just don't trust it. I keep waiting for it to short circuit again."
2,Mom loves her Chopper!,"I got this for my mother for her Birthday this year, whom is disabled and she just LOVES it!It was delivered to Alaska even on the exact day as promised. I WAS IMPRESSED!! :)"
2,"i was left in a nuclear winter of cold, hard, truth...",this is comedy on the edge of the black hole. you aren't coming back out. 4 cd's and an hour-long comedy channel special are never going to be enough of bill hicks. see for yourself.
2,"stop, drop & funk","This album brings you to the world of FLORDIA FUNK. Tony Faline is one of the biggest funky breaks dj and producers in the world. This album is full of funky bass lines, and sounds that, you just want to get up and groove to. This albums features tracks that are played in clubs and underground raves all over the world. I seriously sugest this album to you break beat lovers!"
1,Cheap Plastic Handles!,"The tool generally opens most jars. However, I had one jar that the opener just couldn't get a good grip. When I tried squeezing hard on the tool, it snapped apart into two pieces!! So, appears that the tool is made with cheap plastic."
2,Lively Reading!,Ms. Benedict's polished talent offers an attention-grabbing tale of intrigue and lust in a remarkably accurate historical setting. It is next to impossible to put this book down.
2,"A very good overview, well-written and well structured book.",The cases studied are very updated and they analyze several situation at many countries(on unusual economics situations).
1,Looking for the Right Book,First of all this book might be what you are looking for as an informational book. This book really gives the history and only a couple of hieroglyphs. I mean you can learn a lot of history and not a lot of hieroglyphs if that is what you want. Really this is not a good book in gerneral at all if all you want to is learn hieroglyhps.
1,Churches Duped by Green Extremists by Henry Lamb,"Churches Duped by Green Extremists [article]by Henry LambHenry Lamb is the executive VP of the Environmental Conservation Organizationand chairman of Sovereignty International.[...]Few, if any, of the churches realize that the National Religious Partnership for the Environment is the outgrowth of extreme ecologists who believe the Bible is obsolete, that the earth - gaia - is the giver of life, that human beings are but individual cells in the gaia organism, and that the United Nations is the evolving ""brain"" of gaia."
2,"Sometimes there are no happy endings, just endings","Reality sucks but not without a bite first. This indie is, to me, a stand-out among gay cinematic achievements because of its brilliant script and its non-fairy tale type of ending. In the stark reality of life, there are beautiful moments that do not necessarily lead to happy endings. Sometimes love is meant to be savoured in that one miniscule moment and then it's off beyond one's reach. How do we deal with it? We just do.I certainly enjoyed watching it and would gladly recommend it."
1,It's not what it says-be careful!,"I recently ordered this product. When it arrived, I searched for the ingredients and found out there are no gingseng nor melon ingredients. It's only cucumber. Apparently the name of the product is misleading.I called the customer service, who admitted that the name of the product should have had been changed and promised to make the change. Yet until now the name has not been changed. So make sure you are really after a cucumber peel-off mask not with Gingseng nor melon."
2,Smells great and no animals harmed,I like to have my clothes smell good but it is important to me not to use products tested on animals. I wish more companies could provide products like that.
1,lose weight quick books are a scam! which is exactly what I told my boyfriend before and after he bought this ridiculous book,"The book was in great condition and arrived in good time. However, losing weight quickly is dangerous and unhealthy. The authors of books such as these are unscroupulous. Their only want is to make money at anothers expense. I do not approve of dieting schemes and I abhor anyone who writes of such nonsense."
1,Don't be fooled - this is not good for you,"Firstly, this is not condensed soup, and it is this and lacking in consistency. Secondly, they tripled the amount of sugar per serving. Tastes disgusting.Will never buy again, do not recommend."
2,Best ever kitchen help,Do you want your family to help in the kitchen? Ever have something in a resturant and say to yourself that it would be better only if....? The entire series of books is a must have in any kitchen. They are easy to follow and flavorful. My husband and 2 teen boys now love to cook.
2,Cuisinart Toaster Oven,We purchased this appliance after seeing it in use at a friend's. I like the digital controls because of the accurate temperature and time controls. The size and appearance are attractive as is the control panel. Crumbs etc. collect on a sheet which must be pulled out from the rear - a minor inconvenience especially as it needs to be pulled out maybe once a month. We are happy with the appliance and would recommend it to any potential buyer.
1,Small items,The toys were small and it was difficult to get the straps loose so the could be hung around the bars.
2,Perfect vacation book,"When you read Elizabeth Lowell, you do not expect classical literature. You expect a good story with good characters and a setting that takes us out of our normal day. Moving Target was fun and I had a great time reading it."
2,A Haunting Work of Art,"I read ""Saying Goodbye to Sally"", one of the short stories in this collection, for a writing class. As the weeks passed I could not forget the authentic characters or Richard Yates intriguing and haunting writing style. Bios on him say he is a forgotten American author. I don't know why. He is worthy of being remembered! His work is ironic, thoughtful, and powerful. Although he reminds me a little of F. Scott Fitzgerald, whom he clearly admired, his style is very much his own. I really enjoyed ""Evening on the Cote d'Azur"" and ""The Best of Everything"". He writes about people who try to do the right things in life, but too often fall short. There is a detached observer that warns the reader to live more aware lives or wind up like these characters."
1,easily the worst book i have ever seen on programming,The book mostly throws buzzwords and sample codes to you out of nothing. You cannot follow what the writer had in mind while he was sprinkling concepts so randomly.I learned nothing from the book and would advise you not to get a copy
1,Minispy SATA transfer kit,It doesn't work at all. It's a waste of time and MONEY!!! Don't buy it. Instructions aren't clear and it almost burned my USB port!!!
1,Huge Regression,"I've played since THPS2, and although I don't think anyone buys Tony Hawk games these days looking for shocking originality/innovative gameplay, this game will likely be the last of the genre that I purchase.It feels shoddily done and quickly produced to make a buck from loyal fans...I consider this a scam. No more customization of characters in story mode? Glaringly worse, no more ability to be a girl in story mode? (yes, there are female fans out there..I know I'm not the norm, but throw me a bone...I don't get the point of removing it from a game) First 20+ missions forcing a character to ""learn skills?"" Poorly animated gray screen is subistitution for much hyped ""no load screen""?Come on, Neversoft...moves like this insult and alienate your fan base."
1,Poorly written,"This book was painful to read.While the book was well organized and in some cases, brilliantly done (e.g.,the literary examination of DDR fiction etc.), the authors' own political biases seeped into her historical analysis like water through old asphalt. The chapter on the DDR's health care system was especially bad. Condemning the British National Health Service and the East German system was especially infuriating, since the two systems were comparative apples and oranges.Utterly absent was any mention of the Kampfgruppen or other (numerous) paramilitary organizations. As with many other works, the Stasi figured prominently.Most obnoxious was her use of paragraph-long, tedious,jargon-laden sentences.One sentence was 119 words in length!Sadly, while this book tried to be the DDR's Grunberger (The Twelve Year Reich), it failed. Stasiland is much,much better."
2,"Very pratical, insightful and informative","I have used this book with our Adoption Support Group and for me personally. I am an adult, adopted as a baby. This book is excellent for anyone touched by adoption. It gives the adopted child's perspecitve on being adopted. There are the known and unknown issues adopted children face and this Book is excellent to dig into those areas and to help bring healing. Also excellent for the adopted parent to understand their adopted child. This Book also offers very practical advice to reach your adopted child's heart and help them become all they can be. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone that has been touched by adoption. It is excellent!"
2,AWESOME!,"I'm a huge fan of Zero Hour. I don't even know if they're still around, as they've been off the radar for a couple of years, but after finding this CD, I'll be able to hold off awhile until the next Zero Hour release comes out. Great riffs, spectacular drumming, and great vocals. Good job guys!"
2,My Grandson loves his Go Kart,I would send a picture of him on it with this but do not see the option. My son says that my grandson loves this Go Kart. I sent to him for his 1st birthday so he has time to grow into it for at least a year or two. Great product!!
2,Grills Great,This grill always produces excellent tasting food. Easy to cook with. Easy to clean. Would give 5 stars if it was just a bit more sturdy. If you drop the lid it can cause a problem if it bends. I dropped one and I never got it right again. It will affect the cooking because you lose your air control. I have owned 3 in the last 23 years and still have 2. I doubt if I will ever go to a different grill.
1,A MAJOR Disappointment,"As a long term fan of the Dummies books, I can't begin to express my disappointment in this offering. Scanners for Dummies is so exceptionally elementary as to offer absolutely nothing beyond how to ""push a button"" or ""move a slider."" Nothing is presented that couldn't be discovered by simply turning on the scanner and playing with it for a half hour or so.The worst part, however, is that much of the information about scanners and Paint Shop Pro is misleading and in several cases, just plain wrong. This is the absolute worst Dummies book I have ever read and, while it is not my first one by Mark Chambers, it may well be my last."
2,What a twist!,"This book had an interesting plot that made you want to know what happened to the main character next. The ending was a complete surprise, something that I would have never expected. I can't wait to read the next book!"
1,so terrible,what is going on the series started out awesomely...and this last book just dragged on forever for me. i couldn't wait to get to the end not because i wanted to know what happened but because i couldnt' wait for the book to be over. hopefully book 11 will have some more substance and less aes sedai dramas.
2,Love this bowl!,"My husband and I love great big salads. We were tired of bowls that were too small to keep things from flying out as we ""tossed"". So we got this bowl, and we love it! It's perfect for our needs -- big enough, sturdy enough, and attractive, too! We love this bowl!"
2,Excellent as are all of lorens books,excellent book with lot of useful information a must to have to any library along with the sequel fighters fact book 2
1,yukky...,I turned this movie off after maybe 15 minutes. Please do not waste your hard earned money like I did!
2,great product for a great price,"This photo backpack is a great value for the small price tag of about $40. It has a lot of storage space, holds everything safely, and is easy to take with you. Great for an amateur or pro, someone with a little money or a lot, great for everyone. I would highly recommend this bag to any photographer."
2,"IT, LIVE AND GREAT","I love this cd,the main reason why is because you hear the spinners sing no female background singers on this one.Sadie is very well done live by mr wynn and the super song mighty love you can feel the energy comming off the track great work!.One thing though the classic love don,t love nobody could have been mix better without the fade.A scale from 1-10 it is a 10 enjoy!"
1,I couldn't finish it,I had the audio version of this book...I couldn't get past disc one. It was truly horrible. I think it was the narrator and maybe not the material.Do not get the audiobook of this...
2,satisfactory,"works fine, installed easily.I need to buy two more. But I find minimum word requirements a pain in the you know what."
2,Jay-Z has got too many hot joints here to pass up!!,This album is off the hook... Too many good songs to not buy. Definetly worth the scratch to get this CD. Features a hot classic with my man JAY-D (Jermaine Dupri)-- Money ain't a thang!!
1,"Defective, Cheap and Dangerous is best description","It sputtered a few times and then wouldn't fire. It's really a gimmick design. All the plastic switches are hard to use cheap design. Sent it back.The one to get is the Blazer GB4001. It has aluminum body and metal thumbwheel. It is the same price too.I was looking forward to using this little torch for a project I have daisy-chaining some batteries for a scooter. I could never solder anything until I bought a Weller Butane solderer, but it is too small for a job like that. The electric ones were a pain to use and dangerous even for the user. I may update this review if I find any problems but I don't expect any from the other reviews."
2,Very frank,"Overall, a very interesting read. While I wish he wrote a little more about the players (especially the chapter about his all-time team) and not place too much weight on the behind-the-scene stuff, I liked reading about his experiences with the HOF broadcasters, especially about Bob Elson and Jack Brickhouse. These are big names I wasn't too familiar with, so it was really nice to get an account of how they were like back then."
1,"If you have an MBA: OK, otherwise: skip it","I bought this book before I embarked on my MBA. I tried and tried to make sense of it, no luck (I may be imbecille, but I don't think so). It manages to skip over introductary materials, fails to explains the importance of different topics, have a focus on accounting and is in my opinion extremely boring to read.After having re-read it recently, I believe it is an excellent refresher for many MBA topics and refreshingly witty, but as a starter book: no. As to living up to its title: get real, this wont accomplish you getting nearer an MBA or even getting the hang of the jargon. Buy Gorman's CIGt MBA Basics if you need to learn some jargon."
2,Case Management Review,"This was a required book for a case management class I took. I like the book because it is very compact in size. The explanations and examples about various case management situations were easy to understand and helpful. I had no prior knowledge about case management and this book gave a good look into the concepts, and processes."
2,"If You Really Like Emo, You'd Know Of This Band","Sense Field was a very dynamic group to come out of Los Angeles during the grunge scene during the late 90's. They are definitely NOT grunge, but they had something to prove. They helped influence many of today's indie punk artists. Lead vocalist Jonathan Bunch is now the vocalist for Further Seems Forever, a great Christian indie punk band. ""Found You"" is a great song, especially with the opening drum line and the guitar lines that take you back to 1994, such a great year. ""Today and Tomorrow"" is a great opener to this indie punk classic. ""Killed For Less"" is an essential to anybody's CD collection, especially the one who like today's indie punk generation of bands like Taking Back Sunday, Further Seems Forever and Senses Fail (both names sound alike). Definitely recommended."
1,Where's the beef?,"Any computer hardware is useless without the proper drivers to power them and this pice of hardware is incompatible with Vista.The incoherent manual is well documented by other users, so no further comment is needed.The card did work well enough intitally, before crashing my system."
2,Remington Shaver DA307,"Excellent value for money. It delivers a close shave without a razor burn, and is reliable. As with all foil razors it is not as strong as rotary blades, but performance is superior."
2,Phenominal vocal group,"I recently had the pleasure of seeing these guys in concert. As a music lover in many types of music, this is the one concert I will treasure forever. The ministry of this group has touched many people over the years and their passion for what they do touched everyone in that auditorium that night. Even though the names have changed over the years, the talent and message have remained the same. Give glory to our creator. What makes these guys so special is their unbelievable harmonies and wonderful mix of ""traditional"" gospel songs to fresh new songs, mostly penned by the groups founder Keith Lancaster. You will not be disappointed with any of their ~15 albums and this is a superb collection and a good start if you are new to Acappella. Most of their songs are just the 4 voices with ocassional percussion mixed in on other songs. If you love vocal music and harmonies with a true message, these guys are as good as it gets - period."
1,not for younger babies,I have an 11 month old. She is standing and pulling up on everything but not walking on her own yet. This walker goes extremely fast and if she uses it as a walker; I have to walk with her and hold the back to slow it down so she doesn't fall forward. It really was not what I was looking for in terms of helping her gain more walking mobility. She can however use it as a riding toy.
1,Review,"A couple of things, since I was buying this product they should have the courtesy at least to delete the songs and other stuff recorded. It was registered to someone, I hope it was not stolen since that could be a minor larceny, just indicate that at least the previuos owner knows that this item was sold. Headphones were not even included....."
1,Not a Jane mystery...,"...This is a Mel Van Dyne mystery. Jane is only peripherally involved, and the whole book was just boring. I have read all the Jane Jeffry books to date, and these last 2, ""Bell, Book and Scandal"" and ""A Midsummer Night's Scream"" have been seriously lacking in any kind of the earlier fun and sparkle of the series. I hope Ms. Churchill brings back the old Jane and Shelley soon. I miss them."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. I was hoping to find some new information that would be helpful, but it wasn't anything I hadn't read before by someone else. And it seemed to be geared to people who want to stay in the business world. I returned it."
1,Bad Dvd,"The DVD is defective. It stops about 1/4 into the program, then recycles back to the beginning.Lost return address, so I am just stuck with the bad DVD."
2,MUST SEE!,"If you want to REALLY understand what Islam stands for and the implications it could have on the western world, then you must watch this documentary."
2,"relentless, gutwrenching, engrossing........","200+ pages into this series, I stopped reading the morning paper. 400 pages in, I started to go to bed a little earlier. And now 1600+ pages later, I'm trying to reconcile breaking my no hardcover rule and buying book three. For as much as I can't wait to see what happens, I also fear forgetting half of what and who has happened waiting for part 3 in paperback.GRR Martin belongs in very elite company, critically, for me. He is the Frank Herbert of fantasy. His talent for characterizations is unmatched....gifting us with characters that are varying shades of good and evil. His plot twists are brutal. His use of suspense dizzying. There is no clear cut hero, all are flawed. Don't get too attached to anyone. Expect anything (usually the worst) to happen. And know that who makes it all 900 pages-in tact or no-is as much a crap shoot as the first installment."
2,Damn good learning book,"It's the best learning book I have ever read. I can't really nothing that BUY IT if you want to learn C.Greg have a good humour, and it's help me. I just cant stop read like a good book. There are a lot of small notes, and these are funny to read.If you a totally new programmer you can buy this book. I start from the scratch, and if you already can program other languages, buy this book and read the first 5-6 chapters fast and then the good part comes.I only have one small problem with the book. It is written for Windows people. The compilers the mention is only compilers to windows (MS C compiler, Borland C etc..), nothing about the linux compiler gcc. But thats no problem. You can use all sourcecodes from the book with gcc also.So buy it now. I hope he will write to the end of his life!"
2,"Hey, I like being able to dance to it!","I remember seeing the ""Silent All These Years"" for the first time on VH-1 and sitting there, mesmerized by this totally different music. ""Choirgirl Hotel"" doesn't have quite that impact, but it's still exciting to see Tori go off in a new direction - leaner lyrics and tightly-focused orchestration - after ""Boys For Pele"" which was frequently weird just for wierdness' sake. Four stars instead of five because it didn't knock me on my butt the way ""Little Earthquakes"" did."
1,First and Last Time?,"This is the first Iris Johansen thriller I have read and unfortunately it will probably be my last. The characters are so predictable in their responses to each other that I knew what they would say before they said it. I listened to it as a book on tape which probably made that worse. But Jane, the focus of the book, is simply unbelievable. Aldo and his ""obsession"" strain credibility. The best part was the information about life in ancient Herculaneum and the volcanic eruption."
2,Echoes,"Although, I am a huge Maeve Binchy fan I have found the last few books she has written to be more difficult to 'get into'. If you stick with it you eventually develop interest in the storyline. However,it is not a bad read - just not the page turners you can't put down that you expect from Binchy's previous novels....."
2,good,"I really enjoyed this movie. However, some of the parts of the story was a little over the top but it is still the same quality as the first movie."
2,"Finally, simple solutions for adults with ADD","This is the best organizing book I have read, and I have been reading them since the 1970s. This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review. This book is specific for those of us with ADD. There are very simple solutions to everyday storage and home management problems as well as time management, which are directed to those of us with ADD. We no longer have to live in a mess!! There are user friendly ideas in this book. I have had piles of papers cluttering up my tables, my floor and my life. I am in the process of sorting through ""stuff"" and simplifying and I am looking forward to seeing all my furniture and floors again. One drawer at a time, one table at a time, one room at a time. This book is quite inspiring. I will refer to it often as a reference book."
2,It Works,"This was one of the cheaper bottles in the biggest of sizes. I purchased two. One had a slight leak. I sent it back and it was immediately replaced by one that did not leak. Great customer service. I have experienced slight leakage upon opening the container when the pressure inside is greater than outside (i.e. I let mine rest in my hot car). I guess that just means that the container is air tight. If you want an inexpensive, larger, not-plastic container, this one will do the trick. If you expect to carry this around full of water, it might be a little too big to do so without having it in a backpack."
2,Canon EF 70-300mm,This lens is outstanding. I am a rookie mom taking football pictures for my freshman son's games and the photos I have been able to get are great. I am in the stands and my pictures look like I am right next to the players. I can see their eyes in some photos.I bought my camera at Best Buy but found that Amazon had the best price for lens and memory cardsGreat lens package.
2,Don't Wait!,"I too like all of the other reviewers have purchased this DVD set after purchasing ""Jump Start Your Photography"" and ""Posing with Attitude"". Please understand that Get the Picture produced these DVDs sequentially for a very good reason. Photography needs to be learned in sequential steps and Manny is the person to learned from. I highly recommend all three sets of DVDs and I can't wait until he produces another one."
2,Good product,"I have used them for three sessions and they are fantastic. They roll very well. There are some sounds from one of bearings, but it doesn't affect performance."
1,Junk,"Hard to use controls. Clock began to malfunction after 6 months, stopped working completely shortly after. Junk."
1,BIZARRE BEYOND BELIEF...,"... if nothing else, you've got to see it at least once just to experience it... my personal opinion is that you'll probably connect with ERASERHEAD (and with most Lynch productions) if you're the type who tends to walk on the wild side, intellectually speaking. Otherwise, you'll not likely find any redeeming value in it whatsoever unless you're a film student or possess slightly warped tastes."
1,Only Good for the Dish on Alice!,"Like many others have said below, boring, shallow, and only published because she is the daughter of the famous writer Alice Walker. The only redeeming feature of the book is the delicious dish on her mother. My goodness, Alice Walker certainly lives up to every horrible stereotype of the self-involved second wave feminist. The details invite a reappraisal of the meeting of the personal and the political in certain strands of feminist lit. In this sense, the book needs to be read as the latest installment, albeit somewhat less glamourous, of the ungrateful daughter's nasty tell-all genre, a la Christina Crawford and B.D. Hyman (daughter of Bette Davis). More useful as tabloid material for eggheads rather than general enlightenment."
2,Interesting and warped,"After I read a short story, 'Poached', by this author I was so impressed with how he described living in the rural South, I thought I'd investigate His novels. Smonk is an unusual anti-hero, a warped creature who exibits psychopathic behavior and has no belief system. He does exactly what he pleases at all times without any reguard for societal constraints. Strangely likeable for all that. I like Franklin's writing style because he makes me beleive the Old West was exactly as he depicts and makes me grateful I can experience it through his writing and not personal experience. The Old West seemed really crummy, peopled with lots of Smonks."
1,Not Very Powerful,"This is not the most powerful vacuum. It's strong enough to pick up dust, hair, etc. from bare floors, but it leaves larger particles behind. It's not powerful enough to do anything on carpet. The cord is about half as long as it should be; we had to use an extension cord to vacuum our SMALL kitchen and dining room."
1,Buyer beware - defective ballasts.,ONLY TWO OUT OF TWELVE I HAVE PURCHASED STILL WORK AND THEY WERE THE FIRST ONES (BOUGHT OVER A YEAR AGO). THE REST HAVE FAILED WITHIN A DAY OF INSTALLING. ALWAYS THE BALLAST. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE RECALLED UNTIL THE DEFECT IS ADDRESSED.
1,Unpleasantly suprised by bait-and-switch,"The package says, ""this comprehensive book/compact disc program will help you develop total fluency"", implying that this is a complete course in the Japanese language. However when I opened the package, I saw the book inside is titled ""Beginning Japanese Part 1"" Further review revealed that there is a Beginning Japanese Part 2 book you need to purchase separately. However, Barrons (the publisher) doesn't make a book/CD package available that incorporates the Beginning Japanese Part 2 book, much less anything beyond Beginning level such as Intermediate or Advanced. The package is taped shut so you can't examine it in the bookstore, and it doesn't give detailed list of the contents or any indication that this is just a Beginning Japanese Part 1 course. You purchase the product for quite a lot of money, only to get it home and discover you're getting only part what you thought you paid for."
2,Looks nice,Whiter and more uniform than I really expected from acrylic. I really can't tell it's not glass by looking at it.
2,Very Enlightening,"Before reading this book, I did not know the difference between a buccaneer and a pirate. I thought they were one and the same. Thanks to Marrin, I now understand the difference.With so little known about Captain Morgan before he made a name for himself as a buccaneer, I believe Marrin does an excellent job in setting the scene by describing the world Morgan lived in. Without going over-the-top, he adequately describes the political and social scene of the day however fair or unjust it may have been. He also gives a good impression of the many injustices that were accepted as part of everyday life that are very difficult for us to comprehend today (e.g., slavery, torture, terrorism, etc.).After reading this book, I understand why Morgan was hailed as a hero in England at the time, but it is also very clear why the Spanish compared him to the Devil."
2,Moving,"I have seen the movie starring Tom Cruise, but the book exposed my to a world for which I wasn't prepared. The world of the Vietnam era VA hospitals is horrific. Being an Iraq war veteran, this book again makes me realize how fortunate my life is. This should be a must-read for all Americans. I don't think the book is anti-American, but rather pro-veteran, especially pro-wounded combat veteran."
2,priced right,these lancets are just what they are supposed to be. priced right and functional. i will purchase more when i need them
2,perfect for a young boy,"This watch is cost effective, easy to set the time and alarm, face on watch is not too big, my son loves it"
1,SLOW GOING,"The first 85 pages of this book try and sell the reader on weight training, and discourage people from running.Another book uses the supper slow method to get amazing results the book: Bigger Muscles in 42 Days by Ellington Darden. In this book he uses the supper slow method to help the man pictured on the cover build 34 pounds of muscle in 42 days. The supper slow method woks but I am not sure that you can get everything out of the gym in just 30 min per week. When I did the Darden program 15-20 min. 6 says per week is all I could do at the gym. The Darden program had me working 4x more than this program.You can skip this book if you know that each exercise is doe for ten seconds up, and ten seconds down. Working your muscles until failure."
2,Look no further,"3 light settings Pink (My roomate says its purple lol) red and blue, with the dimming dial, and media controls right above the number pad.Its legit. I thought paying this much for a keyboard would be a mistake.I was wrong.. JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR"
1,Not for every one,"This was my first time ordering mask over the net, i believe masks need to be tried at store before you buy them.And i was right. this mask did not fit my face shape, you need to have medium or perhaps small size face in order to find this mask useful with no leakage. the material of this mask seems alright, the inner liner is not complete therefore its even harder to keep the water out.i woud not recommend this to any one, unless you try it first."
2,Wanderings of a Sperm Whale,Ocean Odyssey opens with a sperm whale now at the end of his eighty year long life beached and dying. It is sad to see but we then are taken on a trip of his long and exciting life.We get to go along with this whale two kilometers below the surface; the deepest depths he can swim. It is awe inspiring to realize the extent to which we do not know about the world we have so near to us covered with water. The life of a sperm whale is covered in great detail with excellent footage which causes you to dream and wonder what new things wait for us to discover in the ocean.We watched this in conjunction with our current study of sea life and it is an excellent addition.The one disappointing thing is the bit about the video is that even here man has to be taken to task for living and using the ocean and its resources. That mantra gets old. Other than that it is fantastic.
1,no refund received,I didnt need this book and ordered it by mistake...it was returned and i have yet to receive my refund....and no communication what so ever...run while you can!!!
2,Worth the money,"For how cost effective this protein is, you can not find a better one online. I recently went into GNC and Vitamin Shoppee and realized that they sell there items for a third more in their stores compared to online. I use this after i workout and have noticed a great difference in how i feel the next day. Buy this stuff and you will not be upset"
1,Not that great,I only bought this because I did not want to spend a few dollars on my credit card on what I really wanted. I really went online to buy Bo Bice's CD.
2,underdog,i totally enjoy the old shows. ordered and received this item in excellant time. completely pleased with the purchasing process...
1,Don't waste your money,"This thermostat is poorly designed. The sensor for air temperature is affected by the heat generated by the relays. When the cooler is not running, the sensed temperature is about 2-3 degrees lower than when the cooler is running.A calibration tool is provided so you can choose whether the correct temperature is sensed with the cooler running or off."
2,Looney Tunes-Back in Action,Such fun to see the Looney Tune characters along with actors! A fun movie that we enjoy watching many times!
2,Buy This if you have the Tri-pod Screen,I should have bought this with my Tri- pod Screen because now it easier to carry the screen around town. It a great buy and worth every penny.
2,Good Product,This product is exactly what we were looking for. We would recommend this product to anybody that is interested in it.
2,Herzog fan turned art fan.,"i have to come clean - i'm a huge Herzog fan. and i'm sure this clouds my review.BUT having said that, this movie blew me away.i must have spent 2 hours after watching this film (saw it in the theater) just hanging around a coffee shop trying to digest what i just saw.it totally made me reevaluate how i felt about culture, art and history. i'm no snob, in fact, i'm a total novice when it comes to art. i have no back round, very little appreciation for it, and never thought i would.but this movie really changed all that for me.i keep finding myself looking at the world in a completely new way.it's crazy.loved it. might be his best work, though it's tough to compare it to much else."
1,Too serious for a funny man,"We all need Al Franken to keep the Right honest or, as Al would say, to MAKE them honest. The big problem I have with this book is that Al, a genuinely funny man, starts to take himself too seriously and gets kind of angry at times. Too bad. His earlier book, ""Rush Limbough is a Big Fat Idiot"", was much funnier and less angry. As an aside, if you've seen Al Franken on TV lately you'll notice that, while Rush has slimmed down, Al has become a really fat guy."
1,I'll wait,"My favorite movies of all-time, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, managed to surprise and anger me with the two-phase release of first theatrical and then extended versions. We have become accustomed to this marketing tactic by now, and few of us are likely to be taken in again. We'll wait more-or-less patiently for the real thing, the extended edition."
1,Not very duraable,"This product is basically a one season toy at best. I do not deny that for the kids that is is a very fun toy when it is inflated. The problem is that it is not a very durable toy. The plastic is not very thick and the smallest abrasion is more than capable of inflicting a pin hole leak that makes the toy deflate and therefore unusable. The decision on whether to purchase the product needs to be based on if one is willing to spend the money knowing full well that this will be a one season product. If the expectation is that this product will last over a number of summers, then that expectation is unrealistic and should discourage the purchase of the product."
1,"Okay at first, then clogged","These were great at first, we loved the size and ""tilt"" feature. However, we stopped using them because nipples would clog. We also use some formula that might be clog-prone, but we didn't have this problem with our other brand of bottles."
1,hp 8200e usb wont work with win 2000 pro....darnit !!!!!!!,"Did a clean install of 98se to w2k pro. I can not get my hp 8200e to operate fully. I can burn small files and 1-3 mps'3 at a time but errors out if I cue up 10-12 mp3's. Also, If I try and burn a large data file it will error. ASPI ...checked and shows ok cdr software used 1) : easy cd 5.01 less take two 2) : various versions of nero 3) : clone cd also have tried various media. also have tried various hp driver updates, but only 5.0.2183.1 dated 11/14/99 will work.If you have any ideas.......????? yeah, I'd like to know"
2,Fine product,"I purchased this becasue I cannot find the face refill anywhere. Wish you could just buy the bream without everything else, but it does the job fine and will still buy again."
1,Interesting premise ruined by ponderous writing style,"Turtledove's goal in this story must have been to write a 600 page novel, rather than tell a crisp and interesting story. Further, his technique of jumping between unrelated vignettes of different characters grew irritating very quickly."
2,Great Griddle & Skillet too!,"The Hamilton Beach 38500 Skillet/Griddle Combination is wonderful! The Griddle is Well worth the price and then you also get the skillet. Since I have a very small kitchen with little counter space the normal rectangular griddle takes up too much space so this one is perfect. It is also amazing how quickly it heats and is really non-stick. It also takes up less space for storage and even comes with a holder that will let you store it standing up on it's side to take up even less space when stored. Great product and design, I would recommend this item highly!"
2,The perfect slipper,This is the perfect slipper. It is like stepping into a cloud. Soles are indoor/outdoor. Machine washable. So happy I purchased these and will consider as gift item in future.
1,better books out there,"ho hum book -- if you want the real thing --- find ""The Art of Manipulation"" by RB Sparkman circa 1976. Pricy, Amazon offrs it for 149.99. I got it on Ebay for around 25.00. I buy these kinds of books, because I am an easy mark and don't like to get taken... Once you purchase it NEVER LET IT OUT OF YOUR SIGHT! I lent mine to someone in 1988 and have been trying to replace it ever since..."
1,Terrible Product,"First time I have posted a review, but this product is so terrible I had too! String to hang it coiled almost beyond use, one of the hanging clips was missing entirely from the planet and made hanging these planets impossible, no labels for which planet is which. Sadly, best use of this product is filling a landfill."
2,House Season 5,House is one of the best shows on television and season 5 was one of its best years. Dr. House is an un-repenting genius who seems to always know everything about everyone.Check House out if you want a refreshing and original TV show that never disappoints.
2,Good product,"I like these. I don't use my gloves as heavily as some, maybe 10 hours/week, but I always sweat heavily into them. I wipe the insides of my gloves immediately after use, then put the glove dogs in. I also keep a couple of desiccant packs in my gym bag for overall moisture control. The inside of my gloves are always dry by the next use, and after 6+ months of regular use they don't stink yet. Worth the price."
1,Terrible Product,"My wife and I purchased this product a year ago, as it held great promise in that we are both working professionals and we hoped that this would be one less chore to perform in our busy lives. At first this product seemed to live up to its claims, however over time (within a few short months) it quickly stopped working properly. The gears became clogged/corroded and the raking mechanism did a better job trapping cat gunk than extracting it from the litter box. All and all it was an expensive disappointment. We read the reviews before purchasing this product (some good and some not so good) and took a chance any way. Don't take the chance!"
2,Brilliant!,This is possibly the best book on the impact of technology in business that I have read. The fact that this book has been extremely well researched makes it extremely credible. Couple that with an extremely comfortable writing style and persuasive arguement and you have a book that will not let you sleep until you are finished.Most books on the subject are based on anecdotal evidence. This work is based on substantive research.This work provides a very persuasive reasoning as to why businesses struggle with certain technological changes.I definitely recommend this book.
2,Guineas Love White Millet -- price is good.,"My guineas love white millet and my old supplier went out of business. So this is great, delivered to my door and the price is pretty good."
1,"Concept good, reliability bad","I was so excited when I found this music stand. It was sturdier than those thin metal folding stands. It was compact when folded up and easy to carry. It was easy to set up. But I've had problems with this stand and am now shopping for another one to replace it.First, one of the legs was too loose. It slid out each time I moved the stand (and in my flute choir, we move around a lot during performances, so this was not good). So I had my handy husband alter the leg and it was better than new. But then, after a performance one night, I heard a snap as I was putting it away. One of the pieces that the legs fit into cracked - and not one that was holding the ""altered piece"". After many hours of super glue and tape repairs, I'm giving up on this. We fix the piece only to have it snap again.My recommendation is this stand is not good for frequent use."
1,CAN'T USE,"I needed a 3 amp, 125 volt fuse for a string of outdoor lights, but these didn't fit- too big. Good thing they were cheap."
2,the dark side of 'The Truman Show',"that about sums it up :-)lots and lots and lots of style, not a whole lot of feeling. terrific FX and some nice touches (the aliens' names, for example). but a month or two later, I remember nothing but the ambience. it was good ambience though :-)"
1,A Major Disappointment with Unsightly Errors,"Well, I rushed out to buy Blink and after the first 20 pages or so, I realized that this book was not worth the money. The Tipping Point was an interesting book, but in this boring and silly volume the author tries to analyze all sorts of topics without the credentials to do so. The reader is left with information that seems upsupported and in some cases outdated. Moreover, the book needs a good editor. Even some of the basics of English have been overlooked. For example, the author mixes a singular object with a plural subject in this sentence, ""we need the ability to know our own mind."" There are a number of examples of this throughout the book and it made me think that the author and the editor rushed to get this book published. What a disservice to readers and what a shame. You know one would think if the author is so good at examining the mind, he would be as good at catching first-grade grammatical errors."
2,The Ghost and Mrs Muir,"Wonderful movie. It was great to see Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison together again. Enjoy it, as I did."
2,wound care,this i likedneeded it for workuse it as a referencelent it to a friend for work reference
1,Don't waste your time and money.,"These don't work. I purchased two, neither one would work to split a signal to two screens. Other reviews (read after I ordered) state the same problem."
1,Pretty Boring and Worthless,"This CD compilation is actually pretty boring and tired. It's probably OK if you spend your whole life listening to top 40 radio, but if you actually have a decent collection of music, steer clear. I was fairly excited when I bought it, but when it arrived, I realized I had just foolishly bought my 5th boring compilation containing such overplayed tracks such as Thievery Corporation's ""The Glass Bead Game"", and K+D's ""Original Bedroom Rockers"". I mean, come on. All the music on this two disk set was pretty cool several years ago. But now you here it everywhere from Lexus commercials to Levi's ads.The real shame here is that record companies are always going to put out lame, boring stuff as long as some dumb sap is stupid enough to buy it. In this case, the dumb sap is ME. Don't do the same thing to yourself. Go pick up something good instead, like one of the Naked Music compilations (Nude Dimensions 1-3, Carte Blanche, etc.), Om Lounge, Paris Lounge, etc."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this along with the matching Barbie and Kelly dolls for my five year old. Although no toy is ever easy to get out of the packaging anymore, these were the most difficult. The pegasus was the most difficult of the three. I cut my fingers twice trying to get it out.My daughter was very excited to receive this pretty horse but quickly became frustrated because, as others have noted, the wings and the saddle do not stay put!The eclosed instructions recommend replacing the batteries upon purchase. The problem is that it takes button cell batteries. I think that most people (like myself)do not keep this type of battery on hand! The Barbie also takes the same kind of battery.Although it is a very pretty toy, it is extremely frustrating. I would not recommmend this toy to anyone."
2,A book of wonders,"If you have ever been to Venice and fell in love with the city then you will be attracted to this novel. Although terrorism is the theme, and there is a mystery element to it, the narrative really deals with a love story that starts and ends in Venice. The descriptions of the lagoons are almost poetry, and indeed the book ends with a poem. It is probably more of a book for romantics than for persons who love the works of Ian Rankin and hard boiled detectived stories.In sum, a lovely book for lovers of romance and Venice."
2,simply the best,"What a great bit of kit ... i got this in the hunting department at Walmart but actually use it when doing offshore sailing races. The red LED light is perfect for checking things when you don't want to ruin your night vision, the white LED is there when you need it and the spot light is just enough to check the tell-tales ... would recomend it to anyone who needs both red and white light at night."
2,classic firm,this 62 minute workout is difficult but doable. I love the beautiful set and the pleasant music. I use my mini-trampoline as my step and I do the jogging aerobics on the trampoline also. The instructor is calm and encouraging. I rotate this workout with other firm workouts. I purchased this used on vhs tape so I paid very little for the workout.
2,Love this movie,"This is probably my favorite Sci-Fi action movie of all time. This one and The Terminator were the ones that made Arnold famous. Can't tell you how many times I've watched it. If you haven't seen it, buy it NOW!!!"
2,All the basics in one place,"If I had to recommend only one general guide to vegetable and edible gardening, this would be it. In addition to information on vegetables, this 224 page guide includes sections on planning your garden; herbs; fruits, berries & nuts; and dealing with pests & diseases.In additon to a fairly standard encyclopedia of vegetables, I especially found the guide to pruning fruit trees, brambles (blackberries, raspberries, etc.), and grapes superior to any descriptions I've found elsewhere. The instructions are easy to read with useful diagrams that actually make sense. I've used the pruning advice to greatly increase my raspberry and grape harvest - much to the envy of my neighbors!"
1,piece of excrement,one dead connection on subwoofer creating 1 speaker only system.cable from sound card to controller didnt fit unless forced and if moved a hair you lose sound or get loud reverb.also speakers did not look like the picture on website but some [...] ugly futuristic attempt
2,Continuing Tradition Of More Great DBZ!!,"This is another great DVD of Dragon Ball Z, entering the third chapter of The Frieza Saga. For those that have been following DBZ on DVD for the last 60+ episodes, you'll be excited to know that on this disc the action-packed epic 30 episode long battle with Frieza finally begins. While the dubbed English voices are still really cheesy, (most likely because Funimation is now handling the dubbing, rather than Pioneer, that handled it on the first 17 volumes), thankfully you can watch the original Japanese version with english subtitles. I noticed major differences in the dialogue between the two versions is different - nothing major - the main points are still made, but sometimes scenes in English look a little awkward with the made-for-american-TV dialogue. This is still lots of fun, thought - and addicting as ever!"
2,"Quick, Concise, To the Point. An excellent read","Gillespie's candid advice for college students is heart felt and useful. He chooses the perfect venue to present useful advice as well as ""common sense"" clues that are often lost on the college freshman. Highly recommend this book to those entering college or have left and want to amusingly recall their own college experiences."
1,All the lids split,"The lids were difficult to put on and shortly after I began using these, the lids started splitting as if they were too small. I have had them about a year and the last lonely lid just split. I am so disappointed because I wanted to be able to store food in them without using plastic wrap."
2,Very Interesting,Was a Christmas gift to my daughter. Chose because she is a big Duke fan. She would recommend book to someone else.
1,Not very good,"Speakerphone works great but the sound quality while on normal mode isn't very clear.Camera is great but the like another person wrote, the buttons on the side is very inconvienent. You often find yourself pressing it by accident.Plus there isn't much ringtones to choose from. Not even normal phone rings if you wanted that.The back lid that holds the battery comes off very easily."
1,Did not work!,"Do not spend your money, I bought it, and I took it as it was recommended but nothing happened. I feel very disappointed."
1,Uninspiring...,"This book suffered from a stifling lack of innovativeness in its approach. I found it was a rehash of similar works, and not one of the better ones at that. It provided some historical interest, but I think there must be better books out there for the price tag."
1,A cult following probably,"I must have misread the story behind this. I didn't realize it was a self-help DVD. I thought it was going to be an actual movie. There's no secret here. One could have easily said, have a good attitude about everything and good things will happen. This could easily fall in line with ""The Celestine Prophacies"" (which by the way was much better). I was disappointed I actually paid for this."
1,"Good design, don't like picture quality.","I love the size of this camera, but I use this camera for business, so when I shoot a photo I have to rely on it for a good shot. I just can't live with the picture quality. I was disappointed with the indoor shots, funny dark brownish color,it never seems to get the color right indoors. I liked being able to shoot short videos, and being able to carry it easily,but like I said I get unreliable picture quality.You would have to carry the manual around to remember what the symbols mean to set it for a different exposure. I hate to send it back, but I give up."
2,Excellent,Solid case. I actually got in for a scoped pellet gun. perfect for protecting the scope. nice foam to hold the gun in place and room for all the add ons. def a good purchase for the money
1,Never received,"I have been waiting for over a month for this movie, and I still have not received it. I wrote an email to Wayne's World but they still have not sent me anything back. I first tried to get this movie from Ebay, well I didn't get it. Then I tried to get it from Amazon, I still have not received it. So I don't recommend getting it from Wayne's World."
1,"Good image quality, sounds really bad","I don't know what made Dream Theater change the previous dvds sound editing formula, but this is really far away from the Budokan dvd. Is it only in my case or drums are totally low, I can't even distinguish what Mike is hitting. Guitar is really loud. I had high expectancy on this dvd because of the songs list and the fact that it would be orchestrated. Now I know that the Budokan dvd remains the best."
2,It works!,Picked up the 941 model for my 9MM dbl stack mag. It fits the mag. with no problem. It's just a piece of plastic and takes a little getting used to but after a couple of loads it comes easy. You can use either hand to hold it. It's got little grooves at the bottom to hold the mag bottom in place while you operate the thumb depressor to load. You have to keep a grip around the whole thing while loading. For $14 bucks it's does the job.
2,Wonderful product!,"I have been taking this product for about 10 years, and I will continue taking it as long as I can afford it. People are always telling me that I look younger than my real age, and I really believe that is because of the Sun Chlorella. I have survived breast cancer twice. After I was diagnosed the first time I started taking several natural supplements. I did not take any chemo treatments or radiation. It took 18 years for the cancer to come back in my right breast. I was diagnosed with it again in July, 2008. The doctor said that the cancer was encapsulated in my breast. In other words my immune system had taken care of the cancer. I can't prove that Sun Chlorella had anything to do with it, but I believe that it did. Like I said before, I will take it as long as I can afford it.Ruth in Mississippi"
2,Kylie Fever,"This is an excellent CD by Kylie all the songs sound great,it's a great CD with great sound to buy for your collection great for fans of any age."
2,Hilarious,"Loved it! Who knew one young man's depression would bring a smile to my face? DVD arrived in perfect working order, right on time. Very happy I purchased this DVD."
2,thank god for this book,This book wasnt the best but help you through the hard spots in the game. I suggest this book to all young and stuck people plaing this game.
2,Much better Silver!~,"Silver has a great personality, and it comes across in her writting. While reading this book, you honestly felt you were with her, she grabed my attention and kept it! She does a wonderful job of taking you through the steps, and making things easy to understand and digest!Great work on this one. Recomend this book!"
1,Goodman and Gilman (Kindle Edition),"The problem with the Kindle version of ""Goodman And Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11th ed."" is that you cannot navigate the table of contents. When you scroll down to go to a specific chapter or section, it puts a box around the entire page and does not let you select anything. Since this a large book, scrolling through it page by page is not an option. Customer service states, ""I understand you are unable to navigate within your Kindle book's table of content by selecting certain sections. This option is not available for this title because this is an option made available by publishers who provide content to the Kindle store."" I contacted them again and hope to get a better solution or someone else to contact concerning this issue. As for now, save your money!"
2,The Best,"Once I picked this book up and started reading I couldnt put it down. I was so upset when I realized it was 1 am and needed to get some sleep, but I finished the book promptly the next afternoon! I cried at the ending, not because of the ending, but because I was so sad the book was over! I want to start it all over again and lose myself in the beautiful writing..."
2,installation,I installed this in a horizontal position which did quite well until the antenna pointed directly at the stations ... a vertical orientation probably would have avoided this issue.now that it is glued to the window hard to change the alignment.still it works pretty well giving me almost as good reception as my old antenna and much better than after the antenna was broken off.
2,Very emotional,"It is a nice step forward for the ""goth"" genre.Indeed, it is impossible to describe this release easily. As otherbands in this area have done (HIM for example), the emotional depth and intensity of goth are there, the slow, churning, cello-driven songs are all here. WHat sets this record apart is its nice variety. Without falling within stereotypes, Lake of Tears have crafted a rich, dense album that is not a bore to listne to from beginning to end. If emotional power is your cup of tea, with a definite metallic undercurrent, give these lads a listen."
1,Mater & McQueen clock a bust,"I sent this clock back. The volumn of the alarm was way too loud and you could not change it, it scared my son who is not usually scared by loud noises. Also it was very hard to set the time, date etc and very easy to change it on accident. Even my sone who loves Cars and everything about it, he is 5, asked me to send it back."
1,I previously bought High Desert Bee Pollen in a Can.,"My earlier purchase was colorful pollen, bright, and very fresh, with a zingy tangy flavor, loved it. This time I ordered a la Internet via Amazon and the pollen has a dull color, and you may break a tooth as I did. I recommend you do not bite down but let it dissolve somewhat on the tongue before biting. It also does not have even half the tangy flavor of the previous purchase. I am no connesseur of bee pollen but the difference was so vast, I do believe what I just purchased is not a fresh product as it is dull in color and hard textured and less flavor, all hallmarks of staleness. I do not recommend, and will not buy again."
1,1.5 gal. capacity? Not even close!,"From the line where the machine cuts off due to low water level to the ""full"" line there is room for exactly one quart of water! One and one half gallons is, of course 6 quarts. This thing worked for me about 4 hours before the water level dropped too low and it automatically shut off. The purpose of buying this humidifier is to be able to sleep. Getting up 2-3 times per night to add water does not work for me."
1,"Good sex, no plot.","I just finished reading Laurel K. Hamiliton's latest, `Danse Macabre'. I was very disappointed. The novel gave a good sense of her true strengths and weaknesses as a writer. She is good at talk, bad at plot; good at sex, bad at action; good at erotica, bad at depth and breadth of character. The `story', such as it is, goes: talk about relationships, fight with Richard, have sex, move to another room, talk about relationships, fight with someone else, have sex, move to nearby corridor, fight with Richard, have group sex...repeat, etc. One novel like that could be an accident or bad editing, two or three is a weakness in the writer. I admire her for starting a genre but she now just writes women's porn, and the problem with women's porn is that we're not really into it"
1,how could he do this to himself?,"I thought Supernatural was genius; let a legend show this generation how music SHOULD sound. Brilliant. not a song I couldn't listen to over and over again.Shaman is a waste. of time. of his gift. of money.Amore(Sexo) is frankly horrid, and except for America w/ P.O.D. and Game of Love(though he could have picked a better singer)i can't listen to more than 30 seconds of any song on this c.d.If you want to hear him at his best, watch Santana's perforamnce at the original Woodstock. To hear him waste his talent, buy this c.d."
2,"If Inkheart was 10 out of 5, Inkspell was 100 out of 5...","I didn't think it was possible to find a book better than Inkheart, but when I read it's sequel, I was proved wrong.It's excessive excellence is complicated to explain but... It's my new favorite book. What else can I say? Of course, this book left us a lot less reassured than Inkheart did, but there's an excuse for that: The fact that this is the second installment in a trilogy. I cannot wait for the final book and of course, wish that it wasn't the final book. But of course, I'll read them all again, because as Mo so greatly puts it, books get thicker every time you read them."
2,The Best from the Best,"In short words this is Macalpine's best album. The sound it is simply gorgeous,it is the result of a true artist and master with a huge canvas(in this case music)to express himself.A must of any metal fan and anyone who appreciates good instrumental music. 11 stars out of 10. Buy it now."
1,Not what I expected,"I was told that A Rose for Emily was one of Faulkner's best work in a gothic story. Unfortunately, it didn't do that much for me. I didn't hate it but I didn't like it either. It just fell flat and I was bored all the way through. In an article I read they compared his work to Edgar Allen Poe how dear they). If you are looking for a quick read in the gothic area A rose for Emily is definitely not it. Check out Edagar Allen Poe's ""A tell-tale heart"" or "" The cask of amontillado"""
1,Disappointed,I borrowed JS & Mr. Norrell from the library. My suggestion is to do the same and if you can make it though the first half of the book then purchase it.
1,Cheap cheap cheap,"This mirror looks great in the picture. And for 200+ dollarsi expected it to be a heavy durable metal frame and pedestal. It is a cheap, plastic, item. I would say its about a 30 dollar item. I am returning it for a refund."
1,Not what I expected,"I expected a burgundy-colored tea (taste and look comparable to Ridgeways Red Berry).Instead I got a dark tea with not much flavor.Can't taste whatever fruit is supposed to be in this.The pyramids are kind of cool, though."
1,Worst episode evah!,"Well.. for deep space nine anyway. At least it isn't as bad as that last Star Trek series where that touchy feel-y guy was captain.There wasn't even a sub-plot to provide some meager amount of exercise to one's brain. Just the very slow moving and boring main plot. I think the writer just had some weird Odo fetish and really wanted to see him naked again. The love interest was a horrible actress, but largely I think it was the writing and perhaps directing that was to blame. Mainly writing I think.. and poor casting for the female."
2,Great Kitchen Scale for the Price.,"This is a wonderful kitchen scale for the price. The digital disply is easy to read and can be changed from grams to ounces easily. The weight of a bowl or container can be zeroed out (tared) as well, which makes it very useful, especially for measuring out ingredients for baking. The white finish cleans easily as well."
1,Wen,"Tried it a few times and was a bit greasy for my hair. Did not use that much product because my hair was going to feel heavy the next day. Used it once a week and then went back to my old shampoo and conditioner,tried it and did not like it."
2,Inject ease,The only issue I had with this product is that it was very difficult to remove the suringe after the injection. I use insulin 4 times a day and each time I was concerned that I would break the product trying to remove the suringe. I did like the fact that you could reduce the dept of the needle into the skin by placing the rings provided onto the injector.
1,very complicated product,I am personally not so familiar with computers but it should not be so difficult to hook up a wireless router and I had a lot of trouble with this. But once I got it together it worked great.
1,Missing something...,This was my first Sandra Brown novel. The first few chapters were s-l-o-w. This book did not hold my interest and I found myself reading this book only when I was using the bathroom.
2,"Suspenseful in its simplicity, review by 17-year old","It's a simple coming-of-age tale, in which young Isaku struggles to provide for his family in their village by the sea. But knowledge of medieval fishing and rites are not the only things the reader can gain from this book.The beauty of this story is its grip on the reader. The prose style is incredibly simple, told almost without emotion, reflecting the routine simplicity of Isaku's life. Yet instead of coming off as dry or clinical, the narrative is harrowing. I have yet to come across another book as matter-of-fact as Shipwrecks that creates such a strong hold on its audience."
2,When We Were Gods,This book was one of the best I have read about Cleopatra and Julius Ceasar. It really brings out the true personalities of these chartacters and you really get to see what life mut have been like for Cleopatra. You remember that the great figures of the past are not so flawless as the marble statues carved of them. That makes this book so real.
2,Nice quality frame,"This is a very nice, high-quality frame. It is well-made, not at all flimsy, and makes all of your pictures look great. It also arrived very quickly - way before the approximated delivery date - and was well packaged. It is a nice enough frame to make it suitable for giving as a gift with some special photos inside."
1,Just Another Musical,"I found this film to be average. I find most musicals (especially MGM productions) to be tedious, so that probably contributes to my lack of enthusiasm for it. The only redeeming aspect of this movie is Gershwin's great music. For fun with friends, or by yourself, wait for the ""An American in Paris"" ballet at the end of the film. When the section comes on, where Gene Kelly is dressed in an off-white outfit, and wearing a Ty Cobb style baseball hat, watch with the sound off."
1,90% torture to the ears,"Britney Spears is not all she is made out to be. Her voice is nasaly and whiny and she sounds like a little kid. Now, she does have two goods songs - ""Baby one more time"" (doesn't EVERYBODY love that song?) and ""Born to make you happy."" The rest of the songs - especially ""Sodapop"" - are torture to the poor human ears. This album is NOT recommended at all. Christina Aguilera is FAR much more talented."
2,Don Bluth's Best Movie,"I saw this movie on HBO Back in the 80's and loved it since - Don Bluth has made many other animated films, but none of them have the class, humor and the fantastic animation of ""The Secret of Nimh"". This was Bluth's ""Citizen Kane"" and he hasnt topped it yet.This was the only time the former Disney animator beat his former bosses with a excellent story and near-perfect characterization. While his other films were far more successful they always seemed to be expensive advertisments for toys with predictable plotlines. Those movies were fun for the little kiddies but, but not much fun for animation fans who wanted Bluth to be the savior of this great art form.My only gripe about the DVD is that it should have been redone for widescreen and 5.1 sound, my copy looks exactly like the VHS print. I guess since MGM thought it was just a ""kids movie"" they didnt need to spend any extra money to remaster it from a better film source and give it a high class presentation."
1,VERY SHALLOW BEWARE,"I expected these to be the size of traditional ice cube trays. They are not. they are barely 1/4"" deep. These are ice FLAKE trays. purely a novelty item not functional as ice cubes. Unless you plan on using the whole tray for each glass.I think they are cute and well made just too shallow to be functional."
1,Blinq teakettle,"The kettle is beautiful, but uncomfortable to use. The handle is sharp and after only a few uses, the enamel started to chip around the spout from removing the whistler for pouring."
1,not for us...,"This just wasn't for us. It is more if you want to learn ballroom dancing. Its not casual dancing at all, very formal. The instructors are okay, but they move kinda quick if you are a first timer with no experience. Not bad, just not for us!"
2,Backing up in style,I like this devise so much that I plan to get another as a back up. Great picture size just like the factor. I connected it to my back up light wire so it comes on when I shift into reverse. It comes on in a second and shows everthing behind my Dodge Caravan. Wiring took a few hours but I wanted no wire showing. There are no wiring instructions but you really don't need them. It makes a beep when I shift into reverse so I know that it is on. My neighbor saw it and now he wants one.
1,Bought it but didn't use it!,"It had been almost two years since I graduated with my chemical engineering degree. I bought this book along with the general review book by the same publisher. I ended up spending all my review time with the general book and I even went with the general afternoon session because the test turned out to be pretty easy. Seriously folks, the general book is all you need. I'm no genius but the test was laughably easier than I thought it was going to be. The actual test was way easier than the practice tests! Don't get me wrong, you still need to study hard. Just study from the general book, do all the practice problems and tests, then prepare to rock!"
1,Worst POS I have bought in a long time,"It sounds pretty good as long as I didn't use the included ear bubs. But, you can only scan up and when you turn it off (which is very difficult as the volume control is inset so much) is does not come back to the same station. It changes stations when you unplug the ear bubs. After about 5 minutes o fuse, the on-off switch in the volume control became intermittent. The clock only works with the radio off so if you want to find out the time, turn the radio off, back on, and reset the station. POS is going back to the store. I have no idea what the battery life will be as I am not keeping it long enough."
1,"Expensive hassle, no jet spray.","This is the first item I have ever returned to Amazon. It simply does provide what you want in a garden hose nozzle.It is very well made, has a comfortable grip and a swivel base.It just does not have any useful spray patterns. No matter where you set the rear flow adjustment or where you turn the front nozzle it only puts out a chaotic mess. No jet stream was attainable.It required way too many turns of the front nozzle to change anything.Not recommended."

1,Disappointing,This book is not data-dense & the writing style is very bland. No real or novel insights.
1,"ryan adams ""demolition""","This release is like waking up with a bad whiskeytown hangover, with a toothache and a cardboard box against your ear for a pillow. i've tried repeatedly, and can find nothing redeeming or even vaguely interesting. It gives the ""y'allternative"" genre a black eye."
2,Hercules,I love this movie! I also love Ricky Martin talking for the Spanish version! I love his video on this DVD too!
1,2 Stars for effort,"Save your money for the penny sale rack. Story is trite, sophomoric and insipid. However, I applaud her for trying."
1,They should pay you to buy this thing!!!,"I bought one of these doorstops and the only feeling I got was that I wasted $50. It has 45 second ESP but it skips after 10 seconds. unless you move the batteries around enough the motor won't turn. You cant turn it off until its done finding (or more often not finding) the disc. This thing dosent even make a good door stop. I give this thing zero stars, but they don't have an option for that."
1,Super Soap,I certainly agree that the show needed to change but wasn't this ep ripped out of an old Danielle Steel novel?
1,"Lovely patterns, important information missing","The patterns in this book are lovely, but I find no indication about what size beads are used, nor is there any information about the quantity of beads. If I rated the book by its eye candy appeal, it would rate four or five stars, but because I might like to create one of the designs, I can give it only one star. I have no idea what beads to use."
2,THATS SO RAVEN SOUNDTRACK,THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST CDS I HAVE EVER RAVEN HAS ONE OF THE BEST VOICES AND ALSO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE CD ARE ALSO GREATEST TO I THINK EVERY ONE SHOULD HAVE THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Ridiculous amount of bugs,"This game could be a 5 star, if it worked properly. I've only had the game one month and I've found several bugs in it. I'm a computer programmer and if my work had this many errors in it, I'd be out of a job.If you win a match within the time limit in 'Rated Game', half the time it'll declare your victory a 'Stalemate'. This has happened probably a dozen times.Also, it sometimes overwrites your save files. I had a profile with a 4-0 record and this morning it was overwritten. I recreated it, won a game and saved it. Thanks to another 'stalemate' that I didn't deserve, I rebooted after a 2nd game. I come back and my new profile with 1 victory saved has been overwritten again.If you love chess, try to get this game used at GameStop or some other used game store. But be warned. It has more bugs in it than Windows 2000."
1,to kill a mockingbird bulk pack 25,"Sorry, I cant review this book, Since the seller terminated this transaction without cause or explanation and refunded my payment."
2,fishing,"pro: very bright, can see for miles ...con: battery last less than 1/2 hr. (-1 star)wonder if i can convert it to use 12v on boat? anyone done this before ?"
1,A new stereotype for the definition of evil.,"This book has some vauable insights: that the source of ""evil"" is lying, a refusal to self reflect, and narcissism, but I believe the term ""evil"" is frighteningly simplistic. For true healing to take place, judgement must be suspended. If a therapist judges a person as evil, whether it be the client or the client's parent, I cannot see how the client can be helped. If the purpose of this book is to protect oneself against evil by being able to define and recognize it, then it only serves to encourage closed thinking."
2,Four hours of joy,"I received this set from my wife, and eagerly put it on my player. It was better than I ever anticipated. The playing was sometimes a cacophony sometimes melodious, but always sublime. If possible this band was underrated, they soared to heights previously unreached. And took Jazz where it needed to go, out in unexplored territory. Jazz had been a little mainstream, and had needed to be shaken up. And by who better than, the most intense band going? If only modern players would take a few chances with their playing, Jazz would be in a far more progressive state than it is in. The fact that Coltrane tried to explore the same tracks with different variations in the personel, say's to me; that the man was on an almost spiritual quest for perfection, in his music. It wasn't always pretty but it sure was beautiful."
1,Not worth it,"We were looking for a mic to use for our stage plays and we thought that this could be the solution to our tight budget. The kids have to be very close to the mic for them to be heard. That defeats the purpose of getting these hanging microphones. It was a mistake buying this one, save your money and get something else."
1,A ridiculous piece of nonsense,This remnant of the early 70's occult pop literature should be allowed to go out of print. Garbled combination of witchtrial satanic mythology and ceremonial magic. Avoid it
1,"OK, however worst movie by the Coen Brothers","I am a great fan of the coen brother's movies, in fact i'd loved evryone i'd seen, until this. Unfortunately, the comic side of this didn't realy settle with me, and there was only 1 par in which i showed any sign of amusemen (the shop highjacking scene). If you want classic coen brothers, look to fargo, the big lebowski, blood simple etc. They could have done a lot better."
2,"Padre Pobre,Padre Rico","Es tremendo libro, te orienta y te ayuda a no depender de tu trabajo y tus estudios(Padre Pobre), si no de tu propio potencial.( Padre Rico )"
1,Disappointed- mixed feelings,"SPANX POWER PANTIESPositive: eliminates VPL (visible panty-lines) They are comfortable. It feels like putting two pantyhose together.Negative: They didn't slim my tummy, thighs, hips or rear. I'm 5'6"" ~131 pounds, size B. I'm a pear shape. Seems to provide some light control. I would achieve the same results with a pair of Lycra or with a pantyhose.Spanx size chart was accurate."
2,"Great book""","I bought this book about a year ago, I must have read the whole book within 2 days because I couldn't get my eyes and mind off of it... Lol. It gave me motivation and great advise on spiritual ""herbal baths"", cleaning the house, yourself & your family to keep good vibes and positive energy around! :) nice little book :)"
2,does a good job,"I like my little speaker system quite well. It does conserve batteries, but the mp3 player does have to have batteries in it and does use that as it's energy source as well. A few times the mp3 player froze up; I had to turn everything off and it worked fine. I'm happy enough with this device that I'd recommend it to others. In fact I'm looking into purchasing another for work. We're a family of four, each with our own mp3 players, we like to take turns plugging our mp3 players into the speakers and share our music with everyone."
2,Backdraft,This is a good movie. I previously had it in VCR format and wanted to upgrade to BluRay. My collection is now up to date with this movie.
2,As advertised.,I paid around $265.00 which is considerably less than everywhere else I looked. The local retail store wanted over $900.00 for the same motor. Delivered faster than promiced. I mounted it on a 1947 Delta band saw with a 6 inch riser block. Worked better than I expected. Turned a worn out light duty saw into a power house. Much cheaper than purchasing a big dollar machine with equal capacity.
1,It hurt to play this.,"Wow. What to say. When I heard FFX was going to have a sequel I was excited... till it came out. FFX-2 consists of the player (who plays as Yuna) running around Spira with Riku and Paine 2 years after the events of FFX. The new costumes of the trio are skimpy (Yuna with her hot pants and Riku managing to fit into an even smaller outfit than what she had in FFX). The music is a weird 70's-marching band-techno which gets very annoying, and I don't even remember the plot because it lacked in having one. They managed to sneek in some scary pop-princess moments, with Yuna singing two pop-tacular songs in the game, and a lot of annoying ""Alright!"" ""We did it!"" *jump and high-five* kind of dialouge. The characters where plain and none really stood out like in past FF games.If you have any respect for FFX, don't play this game. Yet if you want to play it, rent it before wasting more money."
1,Easy read but nothing new or enspiring,"Nothing new or exciting in this book. I enjoyed the easy read, but maybe I missed something as it seemed the owners of the Coffee shop were doing everything right. The consultant just told them to keep doing what they were doing. I hope they did not have to pay her very much!"
2,I'm still trying to get through it,"I would rate this book a five on information and a one on its structure. I'm reading it now for the second time, and having just as much trouble as the first. There is just so much in here, and too much is, I think, rendered in the main text rather than being subjugated as footnotes. The result is a loss of integrity due to these diversions in the text which, at least on my part, leads to confusion.Too many tangents! There is just so much in this book, so many interesting ideas and conceptions and a wealth of history that despite the difficulty I am pursuing it with vigor and writing my own chapter summaries and marginal notes. I would most certainly recommend this book to those interested in this subject, but be warned that it is hard-going. If the authors happen to read this review I would ask them to please, please, write chapter summaries as does Graham Phillips!"
2,One of the best novels... EVER!,"It is rare to read a book and hope that it won't end. Few people can write like Edith Wharton. Her prose is music, the characters and NY 19th century society's depiction are stunning and deep (and the story, heart-wrenching). If you haven't read this book yet, you are missing out on one of the best novels ever written"
2,A wonderful resource and a comfort,"This book was recommended to me by a friend when my dog began having seizures; she said it was well written and provided detailed medical information for those who wanted that but was written clearly and in easily understandable terms for the layman as well. It's true -- although I did a lot of research and learned much from experience, this book has really helped me understand all the different things that could trigger seizures so I could eliminate them or at least be aware of them. It also explained what to do before, during and after my dog has seizures and how to avoid triggering more. Ms. Levin discusses everything you can think of: medications, alternatives, diets, etc. I feel more in control and less fearful of my dog having seizures after having read it. I HIGHLY recommend it."
1,Size issues as well,The shirt is pretty big for a LRG. It's almost like a dress on me. I hope it shrinks in the wash.
2,Detailed instructions,"Barry Publow has put together a great book for anyone interested in a specific book on skating. The pictures are good, giving the reader a visual for what is being explained. The book is dated, but I have not found anything to compare it too. It is a great resource for anyone looking to get into inline or ice skating. I use the drills frequently to improve my form."
2,The most captivating book,"What i think of the book it is the best book i have ever read in my life {other than Harry Potter}.But there is one down side once you start it you just can not stop reading it. What I like about the story is just not one type, it is lots of types: Action,adventure,mystery,suspense.I would definitely recommend this book to J.K. Rowling and people that like Harry Potter books."
1,Harbor Freight,"This item gets fairly good reviews from woodworkers, although I don't own it myself. You can get this directly from a Harbor Freight store with a 20% off coupon for about $135 plus sales tax while avoiding the high cost of shipping."
1,Unimpressive,"I bought this CD after having listened to samples of the cuts on Amazon.com and because it was reviewed so highly. Perhaps I expected too much, but it just seemed ordinary to me. There was no originality there at all. If I could get my money back, I would."
2,Great!!!,Works great. This is the second time I buy it and I will use the product for years to come.
1,Looks Better than it Works!,"Very slick design, however, 8 out of 10 times I used it the person I was talking to complained about not being able to hear me. Very frustrating. Would have to take headset off and use handset, which defeats the purpose. I replaced it with a Plantronics Voyager 510 and people have commented on how well they can now hear me. Not as cool looking on my ear, but worth the good reception."
2,Reuters Guide to World Bond Market,"This readable work helps clarify the vastness and the growth of the world bond market. The focus is mostly on the G-7 countries. Topics include the global economy, technical outlook, and country-by-country politics, ratings, and public debt. The information is dated which is understandable in such a fast moving market. It is a great overview. I would buy a new and expanded edition if it were offered."
1,"Release ""The Michael Johnson Album"" on CD!!","Would someone please just reissue ""The Michael Johnson Album"" on CD or in MP3 format, in it's entirety, in domestic form. It is his greatest piece of work ever. It is so ridiculous that so many great albums never make it to CD in the U.S.A."
1,"Great price point, but...","...I don't know if we got good stuff. We haven't had a problem buying Frontline here in the past, but for some reason, this shipment didn't seem to keep the fleas away. Very disappointing, because even though it was cheaper here, it's still a significant purchase!"
2,Cold Derivative,"I enjoyed my wordtime during Tolya's mid life reflections overlayed over a Dr. Zhighavo momentous canvas. I thought the novel strode over threadbear russian histrionic gimmickry elevating poor Tolya's self doubts to mawkish final scene revelations . I hoped Tolya's cathartic ending would include his worthless drunken stumble on a frozen pike in a subzero Moscow night. Instead, author Grushin's extended this art student's dream into an energetic oppressive claustrophobic vision of this monotonous forgettably staged model of priveledge. The first derivative of a talented writer anchored and bound by youth is dream sequences. I enjoyed reading Grushins words and look forward to her calculus suffused in deeper life experiences."
2,tried them all,"Very good for any thing on the market. You sweat but its manageble. I rotate three [one bad knee], seems not to hold oder, just wear it while showering then put on a dry one. Easy to slide down while sitting or removing. I am 67 and have seen the bad results of most knee surgery. Too many people dont understand impact exersize."
1,Worst bookk i have read so far!,"I am a christian, lived in Iraq uptil 91, sufferd like many others and agree with all ideeas and analysis of general Sada and should therefore like the book. However, the title of his book is misleading in a sense that there are barely any secrets revealled. Moreover it was baddely written in the sense of the abcense of a line or story, let stay beggining or end! The main bulk of the book is spent bij the author on telling how great and wonderfull he thinks he was, and letting repeatidly know who the very best pilot in the Iraqi airforse was! the rest of the book was spent on re- repeating his interpretations and own jugments on the regime and juging other people in the regime, but facts and secrets I did not read."
1,"Disappointment, Overall bad Film","I rented this movie with great excitement and hopes that it would be a very good film. Unfortunately, to my disappointment, it failed miserably. Right from the begining, it presses the whole multi-culutral theme, and tries much too hard to do so. The abundant use of profane racial slurs is repugnant. The acting is in my mind quite sub-par. The only positive about this movie is the good use of floating narrators to tell different stories the blend together. Besides this, the movie is a general disappoinment."
2,Great,The book was like new and it went along with the instructor. The book also went along with the instructor
1,Can I say BORING!,I love vamp & were romances but this was so boring. I couldn't even make myself finish it ~ unlikable characters & a story that was so slow-moving. Considering the reviews I expected it to be pretty good ~ what a disappointment.
1,A Fictional Account of Titus,"Although I have seen ""Titus of Rome"" listed as a biography of Titus it is an historical novel. The author uses dialogue between the characters and invents some improbably scenes: Nero poisons Titus' dog out of spite, Titus meets Saints Peter and Paul in Rome )of course, he's sympathetic) and has a romantic trist with Queen Berenice on Capri, where he has gone for a rest.Domitian is portrayed as a spoiled brat, then a senseless monster. The book has little historical value and is sometimes written like a romance story. Almost all of the information included about the ""good Titus"" and ""bad Domitian"" was been proven false a long time ago. Titus comes off as a golden boy who is unlucky in love but goes down in history as the best of emperors. This is a book to be read as a sentimental view of history."
2,great!!,i thought this was a very great book and everyone should read it! i think they would love it even though it is a history book it is still very awsome.i like the part when he goes back in time and he can't go back until he does something for one of the slave owners.
1,DO NOT USE! Please read this before purchasing!,"I used this on my cat and has seemed to work so far, HOWEVER I came across a site while looking for reviews on another Hartz product and found that Hartz products has been harming and even KILLING MANY MANY animals since 2002! I literally found out an hour ago and have been working hard to tell every pet owner I know! Please check out this site that I found: [...] Hartz is an AWFUL company!"
1,interesting synopsis,"I have this book and Jim Mars is a very interesting speaker, but the book left out a lot and timelines were way off. It seems only to be from the viewpoint of Ingo Swann, no real information about the military remote viewing programs."
2,1776,"quite possibly the best book on the american revolution ever written , if your a history buff you should own a copy"
2,Nice pole,"We recently went through a F1 Tornado, and the pole was still standing with bird house. I lost many sections of fences during this storm (snapped 4x4 posts), so this pole is heavy duty in my opinion. Pole is only mounted in clay to the depth of the ground sheath (not 3ft like many others), and not mounted in concrete. No bending of pole experienced like some other users. As far as I'm concerned, this pole is awesome."
1,It is somewhat helpful,"This book just gets you motivated for a while, but it doesn't last, i'm glad I bought the book for the meditative things, but this book didn't change my life very much."
1,Fun while it lasted,"I had high hopes when I purchased this for my son. It worked great until the first crash. From there it was all downhill. First the tail broke and then the rotors constantly tore. Overall, very disappointed."
1,No longer worked after 3 months,"Nice looking Christmas decoration, but it failed to work by the time we put it away. We probably only played it less than 5 times."
2,A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE,"Donny Osmond is nothing more than extraordinary!! This man has gone through more changes in his personal and professional life that noone could ever imagine, and he has handled those changes with nothing more than exceptional grace! At a time when the music industry would second guess him every move he made, he rose above them (industry watchers) and showed them that with age comes wisdom. He definitely has gained and given alot of wisdom through his 37 years of being in show business. The industry and the general public can definitely learn something from this book"
2,Hot August Night,"I haved loved Neil Diamonds music for years but have never been to any of his concerts until recently in 2010. This two record CD is amazing, it makes me feel like I was there. The minute I turn on my car engine, Neil is there with me and I love it."
2,Manager,"A remarkable book in getting anyone up to speed in the world of Accounts Payable. I found this book extremely, It gives valuable insights to both the begineer and the seasoned pro of AP"
1,No Blind Faith Hyde Park DVD in US,"Sanctuary Visual Entertainment, the label that issued this DVD, informed me that it will not be released in the US due to contractual problems. Reviewers here apparently have the DVD in the European PAL format and not the North American NTSC format and perhaps they have equipment that was able to convert from one to the other. Thus, you will NOT be able to order this DVD from Amazon-US unless and until any contractual problems get resolved. And that's a shame. I was so looking forward to finally, after 37 years, being able to seeing some footage of this supergroup. I may order it directly from the label and find someone able to convert formats for me. The 1 star is here only because Amazon requires me to give a rating, but since I cannot view the product, I cannot properly give it a rating."
2,Original better than remake,"""The Matchmaker"" is the basis for the musical ""Hello Dolly,"" and this film is far better than Gene Kelly's or Gower Champion's musical version, if you can live without the lavish production numbers and Barbra Streisand. A far more amusing and professional ensemble cast, doing a fine adaptation of Thornton Wilder's bright, insightful play. Not that I dislike Walter Matthau, mind you, it's just that I like Paul Ford better in this role. Buy it if you can find it."
2,David Garza is Genius!,"I just saw David perform last night in Dallas where I bought this BoxSet. His songs are POWERFUL, SUBLIME, INVENTIVE, ART.His voice perfectly matches his songs. His guiter playing is MASTERFUL. He is truly original while being rooted in Rock and Pop. This ""STRANGE MESS"" is four CDs and a DVD and covers fifteen years of his career from 89'to 2004'. There is LOVE in THIS."
2,fair trade - sweet!!!,"I don't use a lot of granulated sugar but when I do, this is the brand I buy. Like other reviewers mentioned you can sometimes catch the 10lb size at Costco for much less (membership factors in cost too) but prices change here and often times you can find it priced fairly reasonably.My most recent use for this sugar was for fresh lime-aid and soy milk ice cream; in both cases the sugar melts/blends well without excessive stirring and no settling on the bottom with the beverage and no graininess in the ice cream.I like the fair trade aspect - a small, sweet way to help."
1,Heavy-Handed re-hash of old material,"With this book I expected what the subtitle promises -- ""a lively history of steamboating on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers.""But there is little or no new material in this book. It consists largely of old accounts, mostly contemporary with the steamboat era. Most of the extracts are long, and even with spelling and punctuation modernized, they're difficult to wade through due to the obtuse language and the amount of commentary not related to steamboats. The library of any really serious student of steamboat history will probably already contain much of the original source material for these lengthy quotations. Mine does.If you seek contemporary ""verbal snapshots"" of a few eccentric individuals who traveled once or twice on steamboats, this book may be for you. For the serious steamboat historian, however, it covers too little new ground to be an important history while, containing too much heavy, archaic language to be an enjoyable read."
1,"Faulty backs, less gold","The stones looked good but the metal is a little whimpier than what amazon pictured.I only give it 2 stars because the backs did not fit snug enough to keep the earrings on and one fell out the first day I wore them. So due to the faulty backs I no longer have a pair of earrings. I emailed to see if I could return just the one, and they did get right back to me, but with a no. They did say however that I could purchase one for $14.57 plus shipping by calling them... not worth it!"
1,poor design,The drill has a poorly designed chuck (part that holds the bit). It will not hold a bit tight enough for drilling many types of wood.
2,A good read,"Another good read from Jo Goodman. This book isn't as good as some of her most recent books, but it still held my interest. After reading the Dennehey sisters series and My Steadfast/Reckless heart, nothing can compare. But it, read it, enjoy it, but always go back to her other series."
1,Very high fail rate,I have a Plextor PX-708UF and it works great. These discs have a failure rate of about 75% compared to almost 0 for Memorex non-printables. This is a bad product... buy at your own risk.
1,EPSON DURA BRITE INK JET CARTRIDGE,THE CAPACITY IS VERY LOW FOR THE PRICE. I HAVE OPTED TO GET THE LARGER SIZE SO I DO NOT GET IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRINTING PROJECT AND HAVE IT RUN DRY AND STOP PRINTING.NOT ENOUGH INK FOR THE VALUE.
2,I love it!!,"Rojo Relativo is full of greats songs. I became a fan with Tiziano's Imbranato single from Rosso Relativo album. I don't speak Italian so I decide to buy Rojo Relativo. A great way to discover his latin part. Rojo Relativo reflects a lot of feelings in Alucinado, Si no hubiera nacido, El Confin. It also features Alucinado in original version,dance and tropical music"". It's an incredible mix of hip hop, r&b, ballad and gospel. It's well put together -- Great cd! Favorites songs ""Las Cosas que no dices"", ""Privamera Nuca Fue"",""Perdona"",and ""Rojo Relativo"" favorites ballads, ""Alucinado"", ""Il bimbo dentro, and ""EL Confín"". I just can't wait for his new Italian or Spanish Cd."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!,"I didn't buy this coffee pot from Amazon, I actually bought it from Wal-Mart. I am currently trying to negotiate an exchange with Mr. Coffee directly since I lost my Wal-Mart receipt and could not return it for a refund. This coffee pot never worked correctly, ever. I've cleaned up several massive floods from it, and the coffee has stained my kitchen counter tops (ARGH!) and it ran down my white cupboards staining them as well. Please, no matter how cheap the price may be, please don't buy it, it's just not worth it. The few times it did work correctly, it didn't make a very good cup of coffee anyway."
2,My kids love it,"My 11 Year old was thrilled by this. He's very interested in Space and Astrophysics, so this is a good starting point for him."
1,Hmmm...,"Hmmm...I don't think much of this. In my opinion, book III wrapped things up quite nicely; this seems more like an afterthought than anything else. It wasn't Weis's greatest work ever, but it was pretty good. This last book seems highly unnecessary to me. And I really thought that bringing back Derek Sagan was not a good idea; the way he ended up after book III was quite appropriate. Death is just so predictable and boring an end for him. You can safely stay away from this."
1,"Tryed to Flush it, but It still Stinks","You know you're in trouble when a film starts off with a fast paced, disjointed montage equivilent to a bad music video, complete with horribly dull, not-so-heavy metal guitar wanking and noodling. Set this luke warm music to random images of the 'ol ultra violence and a little ""T &A;"" thrown in for good measure. Yawn. This over hyped [stuff] will have you hitt'n the fast frwd button after the first 6 minutes to get to all those crazy, outta this world fight scenes that you keep reading about, but the pay off just never fully comes. Trust me, you've seen all the fast cutt gun shoot outs a millon times over if you're into this genere.What you do get with ""Dead or Alive""i s a few really great, yet quick, random, taboo""shock"" scenes that Takashi Miike is known for, but their inclusion in the film feels a little forced. Unless you are a hardcore fan of this type of action film mediocrity, save yo money and rent this first."
1,mild,"If you follow the recipe's quantities of spices, the food turns out fairly bland. Also, 1000 should be divided by five since many recipes are repeats with prawns, chicken, vegetables, fish, and beef."
2,love this pan!,"i am a retired pro baker, have had a nordic bundt pan for 30 plus years, decided to get a second pan. don't know what they have done to improve it , but it bakes so much better than the old one , don't hesite buy this one to day!"
2,Good handy reference for TOAD users,"I don't use this book a lot, but have found it to be worthwhile. It's a good read when riding the bus because I can always pick up a tip or two."
2,Adorable and functional!,They stay put and they look super duper cute! I love matching them to my daughter's outfits! Everyone loves them too!
2,GREAT!!!,The cat bed looks great and its sturdy. The fabric thats used seems to collect alot of the cat hair so thats is simple to vacuum off and clean up and less hair laying around the house. I'd say its the perfect size for a normal sized cat. My cat likes to stretch his legs and he uses the leopard print rim as a pillow for his head.
2,Venta a big hit,I'm giving it 5 stars. It's correct dry air in our home caused by our reliance on a wood-burning stove during the heating season. It's also eliminated most of the dust that seems to happen.
1,A PROFIT RIP-OFF!,MATTEL JUST COPIED SOMEONE ELSE'S IDEA AND SOLD IT FOR MORE PROFIT. THIS IS WHAT THIS PRODUCT IS! I SUGGEST BUYING THE ORGINAL GAME (WITH ABOUT 50 MORE SONGS)!
1,What book are these people reviewing?,"I wanted to like this book. I really did. I mean, it makes fundamentalist christians look like the complete and utter fools and hypocrites that they are, so that's got to be good, right? But my god, there's not one memorable character, not one unpredictable plot twist, not one line that doesn't feel like it wasn't crafted on the assembly line in the 'funny novel' factory.I read the whole thing over the course of three twenty minute train rides to and from work, and three seconds after putting it down, I couldn't tell you one remarkable aspect of any character, or one clever turn of phrase that stuck with me.Augusten Burroughs had best stick to memoirs."
2,Works just fine,"Works and fits fine, not even sure you would be able to tell the difference between this and the factory part. Both the old(factory) and new one have the same exact logo/markings stamped on the top. Fits 2002 (and possibly others) Impreza WRX.One note, this took me almost a month to receive. Apparently amazon had some technical problem with the item and so it just sat unshipped for a long time, once amazon fixed it up and made it right I got this item within 3-4 days with prime shipping."
2,"Great Gun, but a little loud.","When I first got the gun I thought the battery would have some charge in it and tried to fire it, it didn't work. You need to charge the battery pretty much overnight the FIRST time you charge it. It is a great gun, it shoots as hard or harder than what Amazon says it does (330 fps) and has a great rate of fire. The battery is really hard to wedge in the circular case where it goes, but after practice it becomes much easier. The Hop-Up knob is very nice if a bit sensitive. the 330 round mag is a godsend, you can just keep unloading at your targed. I havn't tried shooting it anybody but considering how fast the rounds fly comparing to my other gun, it'll sting.Pros:Mostly Metal330 round magazineGreat rate of fireSturdy constructionHop-Up is goodExtremely accurateCons:The battery is extremely hard to get in and out of the gunThe gun is VERY loudOverall I think the Pro's Far outweigh the Con's"
2,Fawnia is the original pole professional,"I have all of Fawnia's DVDs and I also received my Instructor Certification through her in Las Vegas. Not only is she probably THE most knowledgable pole dance instructor in the USA, she is down to earth and genuinely helpful to ALL her students.This is a fabulous beginner's DVD and she makes sure to point out proper movement so newbie's don't hurt themselves.Once you're done with the DVD, pack you bags and go to Vegas to her Pole Fitness Studio for live lessons![...]"
2,The Best C.D. Ever!!!!,"Lauryn Hill's c.d. is awesome. When I first bought it, I didn't know any songs except for Doo Woop. Now I love all the songs. I recommend everyone that liked Lauryn in he Fugees to buy this album."
1,Cuisinart Has Lost Their Edge,"I registered for this knife for a wedding gift. I was excited when my soon to be wife called to tell me that someone had bought the knife. My elation soon turned to disappointment once I began using this knife. The first thing I noticed was the ""non-stick"" dimples aren't very functional. Carrots, garlic, apples, chicken, etc all stick to the blade. Now approx. 6 weeks later, the blade has several deep pits as if someone has been chopping bones or metal (it has not been used for anything like that). This knife has only been used on a bamboo cutting board, washed and dried immediately after use. Now, I have a $40 knife that to me is worth less than the cheap Farberware knife I bought 4 yrs ago. I'm glad nobody bought the Cuisinart 21-Pc. cutlery set I registered for. I think I'll go with the J.A. Henckel set I originally considered."
2,Edge of your seat thriller!,"I love books like, SLEEP TIGHT, by Anne Frasier, real edge of your seat thrillers! The characters are fun, the dialogue lively, and the plot interesting. A very appealing combination!John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures INC.Beverly Hills, California"
2,I love Beerfest.,"Beerfest is extremely hilarious. Although raunchy and sometimes, downright dirty, the Broken Lizard crew delivers this masterpeice spectacularly."
1,Need Updating,"In the past, certain things like the Reiki symbols are kept secret, so like this one, they're never mentioned. But learning the reiki symbols are highly important so, I'd recommend other books and dvd's which contain them, such asReiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should KnowReiki the Ultimate Guide Vol. 5 Learn New Psychic Attunements to Expand Psychic Gifts & HealingReiki The Ultimate Guide Vol. 4 Past Lives & Soul Retrieval Remove Psychic Debris & Heal Your Life (Reiki - The Ultimate Guide)Reiki The Ultimate Guide, Vol. 2 Learn Reiki Healing with Chakras, plus New Reiki Healing Attunements for All Levels (Reiki: The Ultimate Guide)Reiki 1st Level Attunement Become a Reiki Healerand more.This book needs updating."
2,BtDM is simply perfect--MM is talented and versatile.,"""Devil Moon"" is Michelle at her best. She has the voice of an angel, the lyrics of painful experience, and her music veers ""Grace""fully from rock to new folk to near-jazz with amazing versatility. She'll rock you with ""Medicated Magdalene"" and ""Blue Suede"", cross-you-over with ""Grace"" and ""In the Weeds"", and croon you mellow with ""The Edge"". Then ""Dimming Soul"" hits you like a Joplin redux and you're hooked and buying CD's for all your friends. Cannot say enough about the talents of Ms. Malone...."
1,Who would have thaught Batman could be so boring.,"I love Batman. By far the best comic book hero of all time. But just because of my almost religious devotion to the dark knight, doesn't mean I'm not going to notice when a movie reaks. I saw this in the theatre and I swear I was checking my watch hoping this would end. Arnold Schwarzennegger pocketed a cool 25 million for portraying Victor Freeze. He should have had to return it to Warner Bros for the terrible job he did. As for Clooney. Keaton and Kilmer were great Batman. Clooney wouldn't make a good Alfred. Joel Shumacher is an idiot if this is the best he can do. They should have let the director of the animated cartoon make this instead of that hack. Hey was I the only one who screamed in terror when I heard Robin scream ""Cowabunga"" This is Batman not Kung Fu Turtles. If Amazon.com had a 0 star I would have used it."
1,"Mama No, me no like it!","My 2 yrs old who is absolutely in love with wiggles, did not like this one at all. Some songs are so slow it puts us to sleep. It is just too boring.He would only watch it for maybe one song and turns it off."
1,Bad Connection!?,I have had this TV for about 2 years now and serveral months ago I noticed a problem with the cable we had connected to the TV. After several hours of use the picture would develop wavy lines of static that would eventually make the TV unwhatchable. I've tried switching out the cable box the VCR even the coaxial cable the picture still deteriorates after no more than 5 hours of use. The use of the VCR tends to speed the occurence of the problem and can obliterate the picture in roughly 4 hours. Also when whatching cable TV I have noticed ghosts in the picture. I have tried switching cable boxes with the TV in the other room but the problem persits. I would like to belive that the problem is with the cable but after discussing the matter with several of my chums who were pleased with the cable on the next street I ruled that out.I am disapointed with this TV.
2,Build Your Faith,"This book is a real faith-builder. Although we believe by faith that God answers prayer, it's great to have a resource like this that helps our faith by relating wonderful stories about God's loving hand in the lives of the faithful.The accounts are beautifully written to bring out the reality of God's design and to emphasize the spiritual impact that each story deserves.My family has used the book for our devotional times. It helps our children see that God takes notice when we fall to our knees in prayer."
2,Great Book,"The exercises are doable and well illustrated. I liked the combos of exercises. The DVD was a nice bonus- It is 20 min, good for days when you don't have alot of time"
2,Deadlines = Awesome,These guys have so much talent. Death rock organ completes an awesome package these guys put together out of death-rock and punk. 'Last Nail in Your Coffin' and 'Dead Indeed' are some of the best songs around. Its quite near impossible to listen to this CD and not hum 'Go Go to the Graveyard' for days afterwards.
2,Shower Heaven,This showerhead is amazing. The only drawback that I have found to it is I don't want to leave the shower!
1,Waste of money and uncomfortable for the baby,"it seems to be that my baby wasn't comfortable on it. The cotton layer really doesn't insullate well from the plastic underneath so my baby would wake up with a sweaty spotty back (we didn't find his skin to be especially sensitive otherwise so it's definitely a reaction to this product...) Just to make sure you undertand how your baby feels, think of the hospital beds. They are lined with plastic with just a cotton sheet over them. After a day or so they make your skin itch. This is the same construction so why should it feel any different...It does protect the pretty sheet underneath but why would you even bother having a pretty sheet if this thing completely covers it... Just buy those white & blue sheets that you can use and then toss."
2,A fun and engrossing suspense novel; also educational,"***** LOOKOUT for the review by Lauren Brown. Her 2nd paragraph is pure spoilers!! *****While not in the same league as many of Crichton's earlier novels, the story is enjoyable enough as it is. I felt empathy for the main character and appreciated all the obstacles she ran into. I learned some neat stuff about commercial planes and aviation. Don't worry, it's quite easy to follow for anyone of reasonable intelligence.I especially liked the last 50 pages or so, as he really brought the story in for a rapid landing (get it? ;-)If you read real carefully on the last page or so, you get a good chuckle when you realize what the ""official report"" actually said (and WHY it was said that way)."
2,My miniature golden-doodle loves this toy!,I purchased this product for my 28 pound miniature golden-doodle. He played with it for hours after getting it. The toys lasted about 2 weeks before my dog started ripping out the stuffing from the squirrels. I wish the squirrels were made a little better to last longer as my dog really enjoyed playing with this toy.
2,Wow! I enjoyed the books,"A friend of mine gave me this book and I bought The Captain's Fund. I immediately went to the website to find out more about the author and the story. I like knowing the background of the characters and setting. Read both books by Harris. They read fast and easy.If you enjoy a story the moves and doesn't give you pages and pages of description, try Smoldering and The Captain's Fund. The State Trooper characters are real people you get to know."
1,Shallow,"A novel with a timely topic is blemished by a turgid and disjointed writing style. None of the characters is even moderately well developed, and rather crude ethnic stereotyping abounds. The author works too hard at trying to endow a stripper with refined qualities. Rather than exploring any one relationship in depth, the author quickly jumps to another, and then yet another."
1,hot air popper,"I guess this is the best that I could get for the price.My old Wearever hot air popper gave out after 20+ years of great service. I guess I was spoiled.Why do the kernals spit out right from the start? I asked customer service at Presto and they told me I must fill the 1/2 cup up fully or there isn't enough ""weight"" to keep the kernals in the machine. It really doesn't make sense or matter because they still come spitting out right from the initial plug in. Additionally, the kernals seem to burn very fast.That I don't get either.Like usual, the old machines were made much better than the new crappy ones. But what can you do except just go along. No other choice really."
1,Unreliable for certain key combinations,"I ran into trouble when using the left shift and left windows keys simultaneously. For example, I remapped the keys for use on my Mac and then used shift-windows-arrowkey during text editing. Those two modifiers, when used in concert, register only about half the time; the rest of the time, only the arrow key is sent. I'm sure it's the adapter, since it happens on my Dell AT101W and the keyboard from an old HP Pavilion. The latter keyboard doesn't have this problem when using a simpler passthrough USB/PS2 adapter. (I don't have another adapter or a PS2 computer to test the former.)"
1,"Seriously, this makes me cry.","I have given this album a good 6 months or so, having owned it digitally since before it was released. And I am disappointed, to say the least. Admittedly I have a ridiculous emotional attachment to Ms. Phair's earlier work, but this is ridiculous. I fully support an artist's wish to do different work and sell more records, but if I wanted to listen to Sheryl Crow I would buy her albums. This is nothing new. We have seen all this before. I can't appreciate the hints at intelligent songwriting due to the nauseating production, i.e. ""Little Digger."" ""HWC"" is equivalent to ""Girls Gone Wild"" at best, no sexual revolution here. The harmonica just makes it worse. And laughable.I can only hope this is a marketing ploy and the next Liz Phair album will showcase the lyrics and rock'n'roll spirit that many of us are used to."
2,A Very Good Reference CAUTION MIGHT BE ADDICTIVE,"This is one of those books which I refer to often. Whether it is that thing about shell variables or just for finding some obscure command. It is a book which will go well with an expert as well a beginner trying to find her way around. The website has an awesome collection of tools which can be added easily to one's toolkit. What I like the most about this book is that it has covered all the popular flavors of UNIX so it will make a permanent place on the desk for itself. The chapters on security and internet access, groups a lot of commands and information making it very easy to use and find. Even though I was using UNIX for years and thought of myself as an advanced user, a power user if you may. I found this book humbling and learned at least three different ways of doing the same task.Niloufer Tamboly, CISSP"
1,"Chunky, clunky, and poor sound","The earphones seemed decent enough when they first came out of the package. However upon closer inspection, I realized (too late) that you can't separate the earphones from the auto-winder device. So if you want to walk around with these, expect to have a rather large plastic lump hanging from the wires.The sound is decent however the treble output is poor. I'm a treble person and I found the bass way too strong. On the other hand, if you like bass this might be a good thing. They don't even have lables on the earphones to indicate which is the left and right bud. All in all, I say you're probably better off buying ANY other earphones."
2,Stunning!,My well worn paperback of TLD says all that needs saying about this amazing book. I weep for the future of sci-fi/fantasy if TLD is not brought back into print. Dan: This story is a gem. Don't give up on us; we're not going anywhere.
2,Favorite toy,"I bought this for my son for his 1 year birthday a year ago. Even after a year, it has withstood all his playing, dragging, and dropping and he still loves this toy. We have friends' kids who are 6 years old who come over & they gravitate to this toy too!"
1,okay and very slow,"I am currently reading PoD, and it is very slow going, where as in the previous books you were hooked right from the start, with this nothing appears to be happenening much like Lord of Chaos which only took off in the last 2 hundred pages. Lets HOPE book nine get the series back on track."
1,Questionable Durablility!,The first few times I had used this opener it worked like a charm. After a few bottles had been opened the first thing to go was the foil cutter. It fell apart. Then the opener itself started falling apart a couple of weeks ago (only a few months operation). I really like the idea of this item. It made it very easy to open the bottles!! I just wish it had a more durable construction.
1,Beautiful Truck - Lousy Robot,"I bought this Transformer for my 5 year-old grandson. It came in the Robot form. Just getting it out of the box was a chalenge because it was wired in a manner that made removing the twist ties without a wire cutter very difficult. Transforming it into the truck was very complicated and it took a while for my son and I to do it with the cartoon picture instructions provided. (I am an engineer and my son is a computer genius.) Once transformed into a truck, my grandson played with it for a while and tried to change it back to a robot with no sucess. I found it difficult to transform it even after I had done it myself once. He may play with the truck sometimes, but probably not the robot. He really loved the battery operated horn and headlights.I reccoment buying a truck and a robot separately for a child. It would be far cheaper."
2,wonderful,"As a struggling amateur poet, I found Kochs work so liberating. He reminded me that the purpose of poetry is to bring joy and delight, no matter what the form or content. As he did in his other books, he opens up the delight of reading AND speaking poetry."
2,The ST. Valentine Day Massacre,"If you love Al Capone movies I promise you,you will love this one,for it to be a remake the coloring is beautiful and very historical."
2,Great cap for the money,"This cap goes great with the pink womens ReD sox shirts. And, is nicely priced in comparison to those sold by the MLB"
2,A fascinating source book of esoteric Javanese Buddhism.,"I found this book to be a fascinating source book in esoteric Javanese Buddhism. It quotes extensively from European esoteric scholars, theosophical thinkers, Buddhist scholars, as well as from Javanese sources. It attempts to undercover the underlying Buddhist culture of the country now called Indonesia, showing that the Islam overlay is a recent phenomena which has not eradicated the taproot of classical tantric Buddhism imported from India. It is also a personal spiritual voyage by the author, with great sincerity and humility. The central focus of the book is the great monument of Borobudur, which was visited and blessed by His Holiness the Dalai Lama in the 1980's. I think readers interested in South East Asian culture, in Java and Bali, and in Buddhism will find the book very interesting."
1,worked for a little while,after just 6 month of using this product the 3M tape came off and couldnt get it to stick again. worst yet i cant find replacement tape for it.
1,Boring,I did not like it. I was boring and too long to get to the message. I will need to do some more research to find a good one
2,Salif's best,"""Papa"" achieves the confluence of east and west that Keita has sought for years. Credit co-producer Vernon Reid for knowing just when to insert a wild guitar solo or backup chicks singing english and when to shut up and let Salif wail. While not as propulsive as some Afropop, this one is hook-filled and straightforward enought to win over even reluctant American listeners. World music, indeed."
2,Helpful,I am a yearly visitor to Disney World and still find this book helpful. I am able to pinpoint the room location and view that my family desires at a particular resort. I have found that we do not use the touring pages in the book. If you are a first time visitor with only a few days to get to see the parks then this book is for you. .
2,early example of outer space end of the century Sherwood dub,"The usual Sherwood suspects (Prince Far I, Bim Sherman et. al)in some early examples of his dub style. They were all released on ten inch singles originally. Some of the synth stuff sounds dated (ie casio-ish) now, but the soul is still there and I'd recommend this to anyone who likes Lee Perry, King Tubby, Laswell etc."
1,mega man at his worst,"I was surprised to play a Megaman game that sucked that bad! The characters from the original are still cool but man... the newer characters and the newer plot just make the game so weird. It is more difficult, more ""beat around the bush,"" a lot more fighting which gets really annoying after a while, and too many things going on at once. If you like that stuff go ahead and get it. I was thoroughly disappointed when I bought this game... I thought it'd be better than the first. What was I thinking?!?!"
1,Yes son meets Dad,"As a 50 year old Yes fan with such vivid and wonderful memories of Yes music and the late 60's and early 70's YES concerts filled with psychedelic magic, I let the son remix if Dad likes, but I certainly would not buy this."
2,These headbands work great!,"This is the second headband I have purchased for my daughter and it works great. They are easy to use, dry and store. We use them for my youngest daughter as she has tubes in her ears to prevent ear infections and these have really helped. We use them with the ear putty for extra protection. I was kind of disappointed that this one didn't include the ear putty like the first headband did, but that was just a freebie and doesn't take away at all from then headband itself. We use this for both swimming and bathing so rest assured that these are functional and well worth the money."
1,This Game is Horrible,"If you are looking for a cheep but okay DS racing game, stay away from this game. For anyone, buying this game is practically burning money. It's that bad. It is probably the easiest game I've bought."
1,People liberate yourself,"First, there is nothing categorically wrong with this book or the information presented but...This man has read the same books you've all read. Heard the same programs that we've all heard. This is book is 'derivative.' The only difference is that Mr. Harper has taken the time to consolidate it all into one source and add HIS own opinion about 2012.His opinion is not wrong nor is it right. Who the heck knowsBut, they are his opinions.I know nothing about his experiences but his credentials lend nothing to his authority. He offers nothing from deep and dedicated scholarship (the academic sort) but rather anecdotes and assumptions he has arrived at himself from the information freely floating about.Read his book if you want to hear another opinion but try doing something else. Find your own opinion."
2,Tori amazes me again,"The two discs show Tori's greatest strength, her diversity. The studio album is filled with some of her most innovative material. From the nightmarish desert landscape in ""Juarez"" to the dreamy feel of ""lust"". She can take you back to the party days in ""Glory of the 80s"". Despite all the technology this album creates its her lyrics that stand out above the rest. Check out the catchy and innovative ""Datura."" The live album is probably one of the most amazing ones i've heard in awhile. She is truly a powerful artist and cannot put this album down for a second. From the raging ""Precious Things"" to the relaxing ""Purple People"" this album has it all. One of my favourite tracks is her re-working of the b-side ""Sugar"" which is something she has done with a lot of her old material. She always surprises me with her ability to create entirely new material even with her old songs. She never disappoints and I can say for sure that this album, just like her old ones, doesn't."
1,A dog of a book; a huge disappointment,"Perhaps I expected too much from this book. I had thought it would be a valuable reference for anyone who appreciates television and its history. Instead, the book is aimless drivel about nothing but the author's own opinions, not to mention his revolting and juvenile puns, appearing seeminly on every other line."
2,Finally!,"I've always been a fan of trance's melodies and good beats, and its been hard to find like cds that had more than just like 3 good songs on it. But I really like this one, i even took time out to write about it so im pretty impressed. Pretty much all the songs are good and pump you up right before you leave out clubbing or whatever, so to whoever reads this, definately just try it out, youll see what i mean."
1,Wrong Product Sent!,"Was sent and charged for a DVD when I ordered a CD! Sellers website ImportCD is DOWN, and I am very frustrated in trying to return and get a refund! DON'T ORDER FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!"
2,Liked the book...loathed the movie...,"What was Streisand thinking when she made a movie of this book? I am certain the author can't have been too happy with anything but the money he got. For one thing, it is totally wrong for a therapist to sleep with her patient.Streisand, who has always purported to be so sensitive to social issues, should have known that this is a no-no.I can't help thinking that she made the movie to show off her manicure. And to add Nick Nolte to her list of hunky on-screen mates. Vanity, all is vanity.Do read the book. It's deep and meaningful. Skip the flick."
1,Waste of money...,"This product is a waste of money. The package says to allow EIGHT weeks for it to work!! The whole thing doesn't last that long. It lasted me about six weeks. You see some results but it feels like you're being inflated and then if you don't take it even for a few days you deflate. Don't waste you money with this stuff, just invest in some good creatine and protein and your pump will last longer and you'll gain more mass."
2,Excellent value for price,These seemed to be the most consistent pods. I tried a sampler pack before of many different brands and the Illy and Lavazza pods had the most consistent least bitter taste. Lavazza pods have nice creme. The water flows faster compared to the Illy pods so need to run the expresso machine for a little less time. The Illy pods are probably a little better quality - but at twice the price are not worth the additional investment. I would strongly recommend these. And the shipper was on time and the goods packed well. They do come loose so you will need a container to store them (unlike the illy pods that are boxed)
2,Good representative of the time,"""A great soundtrack for an even better movie. The director has managed to capture the mood of the 70s and early 80s very well using both the medium of film and CD."
1,Another Fail,I bought this at Costco. A month later the on/off button fell though and broke off from the motherboard. This was not a good purchase. I should have checked these user reviews before I purchased it.
1,poor quality electronics and customer service,Like many of the other purchasers of the Rio 800 I have encountered battery problems that in my case began a few weeks after use. Even after correct calibration in the beginning I'm lucky if the battery lasts 2 hours now.Just now after 6 weeks the headphones only give sound on one side.If you try calling Rio for customer service by phone remember to have a meal available while you wait for an answer.In the distant past I remember being quite pleased with the player originally but if it doesn't work who cares about its features and sound quality.
2,I like it so far.,I have 2 Suspension Multi-tools from Gerber and decided to get this model for the tougher jobs I have. It is stronger then my other 2 and more comfortable when squeezing hard. I don't really like how the inner tools have to come out. I was so used to opening the knife part with one finger from the smaller models. I know that an opening mechanism like the Suspension would make it less comfortable however. I guess I'll take the comfort in this case. The case seams pretty good. It is a little heavy and big but again I needed something stronger and so I have it. It's a breeze to open and close the pliers and I got a good deal on the price. The only thing I would like to see is the pliers to retract flush with the handle and maybe a better way to get a hold on the smaller tools. It's functional and will now be my sidekick in the woods while hunting.
2,Good vs. Evil - GOOD BOOK!,"This book is a good in helping explain Halloween to young children (probably best starting at age 4). Book incorporates Jesus, part of Amazing Grace song, and scripture. It is a great way to help little ones not to be afraid too! Overall, it's a good book."
2,bigger and still Deffer,"I love this album. Sure not all the songs are great, but the ones that hold up are I'm bad, Kanday, go cut kreator, the breakthrough, i need love and the do-wop. Which is more than half the album.This record shows that LL was a force to be reckoned with."
1,THIS BOOKS STINKS,"I didn't like this book it was way to confusing, i don't think teachers should make kids read this book it is definantly not a kids kinda book."
1,Puffery and Arrogance,"This book is full of arrogant comments by New York City people who say that if you don't dress the way they say, you'll look foolish. Nothing too interesting in here."
1,"Garbage, they're all garbage","Listen carefully to the samples, most of these ""oldies"" collections are NEW VERSIONS. Some by the original artists and some not, none that I have heard are the ones you remember...I can't find ANY actual anthologies here or in stores. Look for the line ""new stereo recordings by the original artists"" or some such comment, these collections are ripoffs!"
1,Hmmmm,"Not sure if I got a lemon or not... I can't seem to get mine to work continuously. I'll set the timer and it will work for the night, then the next night it never turns on.I'm going to fiddle with it a little more to see if I can't get it to work properly, but it's not a very good product at the moment."
1,Pokemon Tattoo Series 2 (Tattoo Activity).,"I bought 2 of this series for my kids, who thought the were great, but did anyone else but me notice that the cover boasts ""150 tattoos!"", yet if you actually count them there are only 50! You have to buy all 3 in the series to get the 150! Very misleading! Though the kids did not mind, I feel it is a rip-off!"
2,Fist of Legend Lands its Blow!,"This movie, Fist of Legend, is still one of my favorite movies staring the honorable Jet Li as Chen Zen. It presents the tensions of Japanese/Chinese culture in the early twentieth century well and tries to stymie prejudice on either side by Chen Zen's unaccepted romance with a Japanese woman Mitsuku. Chen Zen fights with honor as well as his Japanese adversary Akutagawa and the Mitsuku's uncle the esteemed Japanese master. My favorite scene is when Chen and the Japanese master fight blindfolded and later talk of philosophically adapting to another's fighting...This is a true martial arts movie! This is the movie that inspired me to train more in the martial arts. Check this one out...You will not be disappointed!"
1,"Lacking, wandering: similar to many ""classics""","With all due respect to Salinger fans, I found this lacking. The only entertaining thing, in my eyes, was the references to Jappam and the meditations. Still, as far as the ""story"" itself, there wasn't much of one. Though I'm not a huge fan of ""Catcher in the Rye"" either, at least that one took you through the life of a boy. This one left you in an apartment and let you hear them talk. Oh boy."
2,A Must Read,Matthew Bracken is one of the best down-to-earth straight-to-the-point writers around today. His goal is to make you think and he pulls this off beautifully. A must read for all patriotic Americans.
2,Telling how sausage is made,This is the first book to explain the complexity of school district politics and show how questions of educational quality are so often put second to adult interests. It shows how one of the biggest and most complex cities in American has actually made some -- though not enough -- improvements to its public schools. it also provides good suggestions for school board members and citizens elsewhere.
1,WARNING! The trailers are RRR rated!,"I got this movie for my son because it was PG, but when we popped it in the player, the first trailer had VERY R rated NUDITY and the second trailer had VERY R rated language!The movie itself was awful in terms of acting, style and story, but it did not have any offensive content. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR KIDS!"
2,One of the Best Sondtracks Recorded For DS!,"I have listen to this CD several times, and my favorite is the piano version of Quentins Theme track 3 and #1 At The Blue Whale (The Charles Randolph Grean Sounde) - track 8.I also enjoyed the piano version of ""I wanna Dance With You "" track 13.I have always enjoyed the Quentin's Theme but the only other album that has this cut has David Selby singing in it in the Original DS Soundtrack Deluxe version."
2,real world rules,"I have not bought this cd yet, but will soon because I love the real world, especially Matt! I love him, hes a hott-E! ok, ur not gonna find this reveiw helpful R u? ok.... I don't think that I've heard any of these songs on here, but I'm a hardcore, diehard real world fan, so of coarse I'm gonna by it! I'll probably like it cuz I like just about any music."
2,Not Sandra's best but good enough,"Sandra fan since the 80's. Obviously her music had to change in the last 20-30 years, so it can't really be compared to some of her classic works."
2,Wow!,Credit After Bankruptcy has helped us in reestablishing our credit. We use it as a reference guide in finding ways to repair the damage bankruptcy can do to your credit rating. We only wish we had it sooner!
2,This book will change your life.,"...If your looking for a meaningful long term romantic relationship then this is the book for you.This book explains everything that is misunderstood about true love. It emphasizes building a foundation of friendship and respect, and in time romance. It even explains how to get the coldest people to warm up to you.This book shows how ""love is a predictable human response"". If your a logical person, this book explains love in logical terms. Or actions and reactions.If your looking for help on how to inspirer and maintain a long term relationship, then this is the book for you."
2,wonderful to have,"you can trust that patchwork place to get a fabulous book in you hands. now the projects begin! simple to read, cutting directions are great and the layouts are beautiful. this will be a well used book in my studio!"
1,Heavy-Handed and pedestrian,"This book starts off reasonably interesting, and I had hoped to read a book rife with futuristic politics and personal hubris. But it soon degenerates into a rather mundane diatribe for or against religion--it's hard to tell--and, while I usually enjoy such books that discuss these issues, Heinlein doesn't pull it off effectively. Heinlein seems to spend the first third of the book being interesting, then switching to soapbox mode. Such methods do not a good book make.Still, the characters are reasonably intriguing; the three girls and other workers who live with Judal are more fleshed out, in my mind, than Valentine Michael Smith or Jill.This would be an excellent read--if it were about 200 pages shorter."
2,Simply the standard,"For engineers, this is THE calculator. Unfortunately,Carly canned it along with all the decent calculators.Get yours while you can!"
1,Project driven instead of learning or reference book,"The authors take a project management approach to SharePoint. The book takes you through all the steps necessary when starting a new SharePoint system. My issue with this approach is that unless you have a reasonable understanding of SharePoint first, it's difficult to grasp the concepts they are explaining.This would be a good book as a guide to creating a SharePoint system from scratch but you'll be better off getting another book to actually learn the software first."
2,Great product!,"I tried to use vinyl mats to protect my new flooring from my rolling office chair, but they did not work. I found these polycarbonate mats for hard floors, and I now have three in my office and one in my entry to protect the new flooring from dirt, etc. These look nice and do a great job protecting the floor. I received them in three different shipments, and all of them arrived early. These cost more than the vinyl mats, but they are definitely worth it!"
1,Take It Off The Rack And It's Wack Put It Back,"I don't know what's up with all of these 4-5 star reviews. This movie was awful. There was no plot and the movie just seemed to drag. Not even the guest appearances by Afrika Bambataa, Melle Mel, and the Rock Steady Crew could save it. I couldn't wait for it to be over with. The ""graffiti"" throughout the movie was absolutely awful. Ramo and his girlfriend were too white to have a baby that dark with curly hair. Guy Davis was fine back then, but not anymore. Rae Dawn Chong was just annoying. This is one movie I never want to see again."
1,It broke after 3 1/2 months and it can't be returned.,"Our previous Farberware coffeemaker lasted over 4 years. This one lasted 3 1/2 months. Yesterday morning, one of the prongs in the base broke off, making the pot unusable.There was a time when Farberware sold high-quality products. Sadly, those days are apparently gone. This Chinese-made percolator is garbage.J&R; Music World gives a 30-day guarantee. Farberware gives one year and has not responded after several attempts."
2,Different kind of Chuckit...,"Nice ball however it is different from other chuckit balls we've purchased. Our other Chuckit balls are similiar to tennis balls with fuzz around the outside. This particular ball is rubber... it bounces nicely but our dog prefers the ""tennis ball"" feel and doesn't really this this model."
1,Coby TF-DVD7377 7-Inch DivX Compatible Portable DVD,"I gave it a 2/5 because I don't think the company is seriously about quality. The biggest disappointment I had with this portable DVD is its inability to use the A/V input. Make no mistake about it, it has the A/V input and output switch, but the A/V input simply doesn't work. The box/manual never confirms it has or not, but it has the notation ""--"". The 2 dashes tell me nothing. I called their support - 1st, not sure. 2nd try - it doesn't support A/V input. I went on and ask what's the A/V input for - he (support) said I don't know. It sounds like it's time to push the product out to market, and they could carless about a defect (the AV input) used by less (say 10%) ppl use it."
2,Too Stingy with the Leather,"Very nice watch, but the band is too short my 8 inch wrist. Ill keep the watch but must replace the band."
2,Very well done,I found Downton Abbey very well done and entertaining. I'm a not real big fan of some of the British dramas but this had enough speed and good acting to hold my interest.
1,Rip Off,Receieved toy and gave as a gift. It never worked. Now I have to return it and I get a portion of the money back. Rip off
1,Can you call this a textbook??,"This book is probably the most horrible textbook I've seen in my life. There are several reasons:1.They introduce new concept in the example, instead of putting them in a box label Definition or Theorem.2.And some consecutive theorems are too trivial to be called theorems, they are more like lemma3.Lacks mathematical rigorousness, most of the time, they just do things without explaining it. (They talk about linear independence and the determinant matrix without introducing some concept from linear algebra. And use operators without going over what they really are)4.The structure of each chapter is sloppy and illogical.Don't buy this book unless it's required for your class"
2,Billy and Emma is Uplifting and Fun,"Billy and Emma is one of my son's favorite books. Even if you are not fond of parrots, if you like beautiful illustrations, adventure, and enjoy a happy ending, you will like Billy and Emma. Billy and Emma, two macaws who are best friends, enjoyed a happy life at the zoo until Emma was kidnaped by a robber. Despondent and desperate, Billy turns to his friend Nancy the crow for help. With the aid of Harold the owl and some friendly pidgeons, Billy and Nancy perform a daring rescue. While telling a very entertaining story, Billy and Emma teaches about the importance of friendship, teamwork, and good triumphing over evil."
1,"Sad, sad product",Knives we have do not fit and product is not as expected. Wife does not like it. I think I will return it.
2,"Overall good, but......","I enjoyed some of the stories in this one. I doubt if a man would have a clue as to what some of the stories were about but at least the cover may draw their attention. I, of course, would have liked to have seen more girl/girl stuff, but hey, that is just me."
2,Love it,"There seems to be some TPB fans out there that think the Christmas special isn't up to snuff with the rest of the show, but they are wrong. I am not going to get into too much detail because I don't want to ruin it for other people, but I will say the trademark TPB humor is here and also the special gives a little history of the characters. What seems to throw off some people is that the special focuses more on values, family, and the true meaning of Christmas. Because the show is a little more serious people seem to laugh less even when something funny is taking place. Overall I love the Christmas special and the fact that the show is more heartfelt version of TPB."
1,Not what I expected.,"This book covers WSH 2.0. However, there was no subject matter on the XML format (wsf files) of WSH 2.0, covering includes, multiple scripting language support, etc. This book covered nothing but the Windows Scripting Host in VBScript format (vbs files) only. JScript was not included at all! JScript is easily translated from VBScript, however, this was still a setback of the book. A lot of emphasis was put on using COM objects, and calling these objects' data members via script. This is fine, but most of the functionality was written in Visual Basic -- again not what I expected. Scripting was made to write short, quick automated tasks, not to fire up Visual Basic and create a DLL every time you want to write a new script. The book is a decent reference, but not as good as Microsoft's free download. I would suggest getting this first. It does demonstate some examples of automating certain tasks, and shows some helpful tips and tricks."
1,Fun but Broke,My son love this spin alot but just a few spin and the it's broken. He still love it and try to spin by hand. Would not recommend this spin top for its poor quality.
1,Good product..AWWWWFULLLLL Service,We bought this product in December 2004(from amazon.com). Worked fine for the first 5-6 times. Then wouldn't power up. Took it to the authrized panasonic service center. They said the printed circuit board was corroded(!) They said it looked like something spilled over it But the unit didnt show any signs of spillage(their words). We had treated it with such TLC(it cost 400 bucks - no joke!) Anyways contacted Panasonic - they washed their hands off it saying it was all our fault. We are still following it up. But would like to caution any prospective buyers!!!
1,i will never get...................,............the 74 minutes of my life back. not only i'm still dizzy but they couldn't think of anything better. that was the worse movie ever.
2,A wonderful book defining perspective,"This book was read to a group of us at a team meeting. It embodies the values of friendship & caring for others. As soon as I got home, I immediately began my search this charming book."
2,wrt54gs,"I have set up 2 of these in the last month and they are sweet. In the past I have tried netgear and it does not compare. EZ to configure and the home network (ez link advisor) makes things simple. Highly recomended, good range and fast."
2,A great package deal for collectors,As a fan of the genre it was great to see these three movies offered together. Of the movies themselves the second is the standout. With some of the best acting and creativity of the series it outshines the others by far.The commentary tracks make all three worth having. Directors and actors from all three take part and have some pretty good stories to tell while rewatching the movies some of them haven't seen in a while themselves.Definitely worth the purchase price for anyone who appreciates the slasher genre.
2,very small :),The one I got in the mail was black (very happy about it.. blue didn't exactly go with my laptop setup). It is very small and can easily be stored in your laptop case or anywhere else you might want to put it. Seems very sturdy and the usb cables do not come out easily which is very nice.
1,From Fiction to Final Print: How to Sell Rubbish,"It read like a cheesy suspense novel with cliché after cliché. It would be nice if this blissfully ignorant idea of Satanism (I was amused by the ""coven"" bit) to be God-hating were anywhere near the truth, but to each their own and to myself, a good helping of factuality."
1,Arrrgghhhhhhh,"I bought the tape of Turbo the day it came out, as would any other normal Priest fan, I mean, Priest was a promise of quality right? Riding home in my friend's truck, we eagerly popped it into the tape deck....then...some ghastly blip-blip-blip noise not unlike Flock of seagulls rasperried out of the speakers. My mouth dropped open...I fast forwarded...then again...then I placed it carefully back in it's case and chucked it out the window. (True story) If you have never heard Priest before (hard as that is to imagine), I recommend British Steel or Defenders of the faith to any 30-ish guitarists who want to hear how it's done. I recommend Jugulator if you are 15 to 25 and think that Priest is over the hill. I'm afraid I can only recommend Turbo to 30-ish women who used to be 16-ish girls who liked Loverboy."
1,Misleading CD cover,"I wanted the complete Evita soundtrack, and this rendition was terribly disappointing. The cd ends abruptly mid story. Voices are spectacular of course, but the cover suggests this is the original London peformance and a buyer, like me, expects the entire musical score. I wouldn't buy this again."
2,A very smart battle.,I bought this toy for my kid for his birthday and he liked it very much. I have played with him some battles and we had fun. I would like to give you a suggestion: put instructions in other languages for kids outside the States.
1,An immense talent - perhaps wrong vehicle,"Sam Ramey has a beautiful voice and is such a wonderful actor, (anyone who has seen him perform opera knows he's a great presence on stage - he also was great in the pseudo-staged production of ""On the Town""), that it is so disappointing not to like this album. However, if you're choosing between this album and anything by (Church, Bocelli, Watson, Garrett or Brightman),then PLEASE buy this instead. A great voice is still a great voice even if I feel Mr. Ramey doesnt seem particularly comfortable here.Sorry, just feel this one is left better sitting on the shelf."
1,"Quake III - poor successor to Quake 2, Doom, etc","What a waste of money! After enjoying the battles in Wolfenstein, Doom, Doom 2, Quake and Quake 2, I was sure that Quake III would blow them all away. I was tragically wrong. It is just a single person shooter against very boring bots. There is no exploration, no secret places, no interesting critters, no advancing from level to level, no save and no resume. Maybe if you're in to fragging anonymous spotty boys via the Internet it might have some attraction but I'm not so it didn't. It's utterly devoid of imagination. ID software will not get any more of my dollars. Try the demo before you put down real cash for this hollow shell of a so-called game."
1,IF THIS IS A GREATEST HITS PACKAGE....,I must ponder my tastes in music. I obviously am not hearing what everybody else is because I think most of this material is inferior to the two previous greatest hits collection from a fine country singer.
1,What A Pity!,"It's too bad Backstreet's career is over. I'll miss them, especially since I've been such a loyal fan since they came onto the scene in '91. The first two albums were so incredible, I couldn't believe how bad this was. Their voices are still great, but they shouldn't be allowed to write music. ""I Want It That Way"" was so perfect. I couldn't have been more dissappointed in ""Shape of My Heart."" ""The Call"" has to be the dumbest song I've ever heard, ""you're dropping out my battery is low, just so you know we're going to a place near by, gotta go."" I'm not kidding, that's really part of the chorus! The only listenable song here is ""Get Another Boyfriend"" the rest is just- BORING!Get ""This Time Around"" ""No Strings Attached"" or ""Sooner or Later"" if you're looking for a boy band worth listening to."
2,Fantastic Heating Pad!,"Sunbeam Health at Home King Size Heating Pad with HeatSense Technology, GreyLove this heating pad and I've had many. It gets hot enough for me and isn't too hot for my husband, if I'm willing to share! The controls are easy to use and the auto-off feature is nice for forgetful people like me. The pad is made of a soft, flexible fabric and is a great size. I plan to buy another one in the near future so that I never have to be without :)"
2,Wonderful recording by Carlos Kleiber,"This was a Christmas gift that I gave to my best friend. It was a last minute purchased, and was not too sure I would get it in time to give away. But Amazon.com was amazing and got it just in time to be given as a Christmas gift."
1,Poor Quality,"These by far are the worst earphones I've ever purchased. They don't stay in your ears, require constant adjusting and the quality stinks! Save your money and purchase something different."
1,Was going to purchase Spore but the DRM has scared me off.,"Why EA and other game companies believe that treating all their customers like criminals and installing low-level nanny programs (that are hard to install) in their customers' PCs is beyond me. The people who steal games will steal games, this only serves to annoy and drive away legitimate, honest customers. Like me. Sorry EA, would have liked to play Spore, but there are plenty of other games out there that don't treat me like a criminal or limit my resale options. Thanks but no thanks."
1,Sub-par,"I had to go back awhile to write this review, but this ring is NOT worth the amount. For 30 bucks, I expected a heavy, solid ring, this was a cheaply made, semi hollow waste of time and money. To make matters even worse, I ordered a size 8 and recieved something much smaller...it is items like this that frustrate the public, I thought I ought to warn somebody, but if you like this ring, KEEP SEARCHING and you will find a quailty product somewhere else, this one however is not..."
1,They can't be serious!,"Ok, I am trying to redeem myself from low budget movies such as "" Vampire Assassin"" then I run into another bad movie. Lets face it, this movie totally blows. And what is with the main character and her cheesy fighting sound effects? What was Eva thinking when she decide to appear in this movie, she wasn't even the main star. More like a background character with maybe 3 sentences to say and thats it.Please rent this one!"
1,Boring and dull,"Lousy slow-moving movie especially at the start,Carradine looked better as he aged.Reminded me of The Phantom of The Opera movie,below the streets of Paris.Really disappointing,at least for me John was a good actor,just not in this."
1,It has been 6 weeks and it still has not arrived.,"The movie is awesome. I remember watching it on the VHS with my surfer-bum parents 20 years ago. If it ever arrives, I would love to see it again."
2,Excellent Maps,"These maps are laminated for protection. They are quite large, so be aware of that if you want to hang them on your walls."
1,broke,"I bought this the end of November of 2004 for Christmas. It lasted 6 months and then I got the HO3 code, ""can't read disc"". I sent it back to Panasonic who wants $100 for replacement even though it's still under warranty because ""parts and labor"" warranty is only 90 days. I'll never buy another Panasonic product again. This unit is not inexpensive and to have it last less than 1 year is unacceptable."
2,love it,My 5 year old lovea it so much. Along with the rest. He is a happy camper and enjoys watching them.
2,feeling 1971,"Probably one of the greatest records from the eary seventies.Best part is no-one knows about Vincent Crane on organ/bass/vocs,John DuCann with his heavy riffs and sceaming leads and Paul Hammond as the soulful drummer.What sets Atomic Rooster apart is the funk sensibility that can be heard on songs like 'Sleeping for Years' and 'Gershatzer',nevermind the dark,heavy title track that gives us a peek into the gloomy life of ""normal"" people."
1,Do not use this book for newborns.,"Every copy of this book should be put in a bonfire and burnt...Because it is downright misleading. We tried using this book for several weeks and the result was 2 cranky babies. We had several days where the twins had fussy sessions lasting 8 hours until both babies and parents collapsed from exhaustion.You can't use these techniques on newborns or indeed babies below 4 months.Babies need sleeps and naps. Once we found out that babies under 4 months have a maximum wakefulness of 2 hours and made sure we put them down for a nap once the 2 hour limit approached, we were all a lot happier.Do not use this book on newborns, repeat do not use this book on newborns."
1,Illogical,"Let's set the record straight. Catholics believe in salvation by faith and works, Protestants believe in faith alone.How then can a Protestant say that Catholics who have faith are going to Hell?That is the false assumption that this whole book rests on. In the rest of it you will find the typical Protestant rhetoric that tries to pull people from the fullness of the Catholic faith into Protestant sectarian confusion. This book is a lie of Satan."
2,Amazingly and painfully insightful,"I had already read Out of the Shadows by Patrick Carnes but Don't Call it Love was even more a amazing. It was painful to read trying to understand the sex addicts torment as well as the co-addicts. But on the other hand it was also refreshing to know that there is life after sex addiction and recovery is not only possible but necessary. I would recommend this book to anyone in recovery, it has helped me immensely."
1,flawed directions,"As great as it looks, I can't get past the incomplete directions (only printed outside of the box; no directions inside) to get it installed on the wall: it says ""pull out the plastic end cap""...haven't a clue what the plastic end cap is, nor how to pull it out nor how to install the screws that hold it on the box. may have to return."
1,Expiration date 7-2008!!,"I will never order from this company again because the expiration date on the tubes are 7-2008! Considering we're using them for JUNE, JULY and AUGUST of 2008, that means that they're probably NO GOOD!! Sure enough, the one we put on her for JULY, 2008 did NOT work very well! In fact, we put it on her on 7-5-08 and she's been scratching like crazy from FLEAS for a week now and it's not time for the August tube to be put on yet!If this is the best they can do, they can forget me doing business with them!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE....,"...if you are expecting, as I was, a movie that can live up to another Coen Bros. movie, such as The Big Lebowski. I rented Fargo under the assumption that it would be as funny and satiracal as The Big Lebowski, but what I found was a tragic tale of misfortune with some comedy thrown in.I laughed outloud at this movie maybe twice. In all, a total of six people died, and not even in comical fashion. The only thing good I can think to say about Fargo is that the characters did an amazing acting job, and I think this movie could have been alot better if the Coens would have used similar elements as those of their other films.Overall, I would advise the average comedy moviegoer to steer clear of this picture, unless you're really into drama or are currently taking antidepressant medication."
1,Not what I expected...,"I had read all of the great reviews and I guess I just got my hopes up. My son got this for his first birthday and now at 16 months old he still doesn't use it. We use it outside and we have the lookout treehouse inside. He uses the lookout treehouse much more. The slide on the Kangaroo climber if VERY short. Maybe he will get more use out of it someday, I guess I just wanted him to like it more. Easy to assemble and lightweight to move around."
2,HA!,"Yes, I gave in and bought into the product idea. Didnt work for me at all and I was left with a sticky patch on me"
1,Fantasy,"This book may be fine as a fantasy, but I feel it is ridiculous to rewrite actual people's lives and rewrite history just for a buck. Much of this book is a complete fabrication, and I am afraid many will take this book as factual. Now it's a movie so even more people can be misguided."
2,Silicon for Pies?,"I used this silicon round cake pan for a pie, and I won't do it again. It's great for cakes, but making a pumpkin pie and trying to get the pan into the oven filled with liquid was not a good idea.Like I said, for cakes, great pan, not for pies that are liquid."
2,The Best So Far,"I need to preface this by saying I've not yet read Goblet of Fire. That aside, Prisoner of Azkaban was by far the best of the first three books. In my opinion the first two were pleasant little books but Chamber of Secrets was nearly a carbon-copy of the Philosopher's Stone and that took a little bit of the bloom off the rose. However, with the third entry in the series, Ms. Rowling tells a new story (not the same old 'oh-look-Voldemort-is-back type stuff) and really develops the characters for the first time. Harry, forced to deal with the reasons for his state in life, reacts as I imagine a real 13 year old would--angry and confused. Hermione is fleshed out and made to be a little deeper than the know-it-all she's been the whole series. Snape is a delicious villian and steals all the scenes he's in toward the end of the book.All in all, the best to date. I can't wait to read the next one."
1,Be careful what you order,"This DVD is playable only on PAL systems, not the North American format. Caiman won't give me a refund!"
2,a world of wonderful animals,"Suprising the children by using vertically opened pages, this book begins with a simple storyline and evolves into listing an impressive range of exotically named animals. Jonas' lifelike watercolour illustrations with clean lines are given an unusual perspective through the playful use of scale and contrast of shapes. Included in the book is a good glossary of the animals named within the story, a pronunciation guide as well as a list of each animal's country of origin. I like the fact that Jonas included extinct animals in her listing which can serve as discussion sparkers on environmental and conservation concerns with children."
2,NOT NO FENCES; BUT STILL GARTH,"EVEN THOUGH GARTH SOUNDS A LITTLE LIGHT IN THE LOAFERS DURING HIS RENDITION OF ""WRAPPED UP IN YOU""(the ba-bas were unnecessary), IT'S STILL A GOOD ALBUM. ""RODEO OR MEXICO"" IS RATED PG-13, BY THE WAY!!! HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE HEARD GARTH SAY, ""I'M RETIRING""?? THE MAN KNOWS HOW TO MARKET HIMSELF. THINK ABOUT IT!! EVERY GARTH FAN IS GOING TO WANT HIS ""last album"", RIGHT. GARTH BROOKS IS A MARKETING GENIUS. NEXT ALBUM: November 2003 (guarantee it!)"
1,NOT VERY GOOD TOO BASIC,"This DVD is sooooo basic and covers nothing beyond the very, basic stitches. And it's only 40 minutes long! my stitch n bitch tells me there are other knit DVDs that for the same price are 3 hours long and give a lot more instruction and information. The group says take a look at THE ART OF KNITTING. I haven't seen it but everyone's raving about it. If all you want to knit is a scarf this DVD is OK,"
1,Two Mall Rats Flee a Sinking Script,"I agree the special effects, sets, costumes and soundtrack are impressive, but after those, what is left? For one, the dialogue is about as shallow as the Atlantic is deep. When Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) is first told the ship has struck an iceberg, all he can say is, 'Hey, that's not good....' Jack and Rose speak like two mall rats of the 1990s, and their oil and water chemistry was not convincing. Jack, for one, is so chipper that he needs to be doused with cold water -- and is. Most of the other characters are stereotypes, with the only heartfelt performance turned in by Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose. In short, Jack and Rose's romance just didn't seem authentic. My expectations sank before the ship did."
2,Still going strong,"It's been three years since I read my first redwall book, salamandastron, and since then I havn't been able to get enough redwall. In the overall collection, this book stands up well against the others. It starts rather strong, with great action that kept me glued to the pages. The ending, though, left a bit to be desired. It just took too long to wrap up and I lost interest. However, if you're looking for a good yarn to curl up with on a lazy suday afternoon, this is definately a book to look at."
1,The title of the book does not correspond to the contents!,The book is very superficial and ranked in wrong category (new-accomplished). It also lacks technical aspects to make it somehow serious. The softwares included in the CD is rather poor comparatively to the size of the book. My advice is browse the book before buying.
1,Do judge a book by its cover,I haven't bought or read this book. I am an art director and would not buy a book about graphic design that has such a horribly ugly cover. It makes me sad on the inside.
1,Disappionting Effort from one of my Most Anticipated Albums!!,"I have been eagerly awaiting this release from RITM for well over 5 years, and I have been greatly let down. The name of the album is appropriate because the material seems dated, as if it was made over a Decade ago. In the nineties this probably would have been a great album. Of course, there are several great tracks but the old. Overall the album lacks creativety and versatility. However, I did give the album two stars for the addition of the DVD, which is well worth the purchase...too bad there live performances do not translate to CD. If you're new to RITM, I would recommend this CD, but if you are like me and seen the live and know the material get it for the DVD."
2,Excellent pruning saw,"After reading the positive reviews on Amazon, I thought I'd give this saw a try.It is better than advertised.I was able to cut a 3-inch oak in 30 seconds and a 6-inch oak in about two minutes. The grip is good and I was able to use it both right-handed and left-handed. I highly recommend this, especially for hard to reach places."
2,Magic is a Magic album,"The Jets will always remain one of my favorite groups and there 3rd release on MCA records was a smash....With there self titled album and Christmas album released.Your wondering how could they follow up such great music...and the follow up Magic is a masterpiece.......Great songs such as I Do You,Make It Real,Cross My Broken Heart,Rocket 2 U,and Anytime...Those would have to be my favorite tracks on the album.Make sure you pick a copy up of this today."
2,The American Prophecies,"Having commemorated the 60th year of the U.S. liberation of Auschwitz, this book is a chilling reminder to make the case of why America must stand with Israel."
1,Selena's Secret is no secret - just trash!,You will not learn any secrets from this piece of cr*p. The only secret you'll learn is that you wasted your money!
1,Half as Nice as they used to be,"The album is really a vehicle for Emerson to showcase his career with The Nice (actually playing with The Nice) and ELP (without L or P). The first CD is material by The Nice and should've continued for CD two. Instead Emerson brings out a different band to play ELP material, which suffers from the lack of Greg Lake's voice. There was enough quality music produced by The Nice that they shouldn't have been pushed aside to play ELP music with other musicians. As a result, the project lacks focus and the energy that ELP produced.The production seems to be rather stilted, as if they simply set up the mixing board and walked away. Keith's keyboards always remain on the left and Dave's guitar is always on the right. Two words: Bor ing.CD1 is worth having, the remaining two are throwaways, which makes this overpriced. They had an excellent opportunity and only partially fulfilled it, apparently in order to satisy Emo's Ego."
1,It's a trap.,"If they didn't want to double dip, they'd release the two versions of each film at the same time instead of trying to release the extended versions closer to the Hobbit while hoping some dupes will be tricked into buying both versions.They had the option to release the two versions at the same time and let people choose one or the other. They also had the option to release special editions with both versions in the same set. They chose to release this version as bait and then try and mop up with the second. Sure, some people are really that un-market saavy, but for the rest of us it's obviously skeevy."
2,Good/Ok movie..,"Ok, so the first time I saw this movie on TV..i fell in love with it! But when you keep watching it over and over..it gets kind of boring..although i don't regret getting it on DVD..I will probably watch this movie once in a while when i am in the mood..."
1,Gosh I love the concept but a total lack of action forced me to stop reading,"I usually go more into depth with my reviews. However, I did not even find the motivation to finish.I love the ideas and concepts of this book, however, I just was not compelled to finish. I like to be compelled when I read. This just didn't do it for me."
2,Perfect,"I was looking for a cheap case for my 2G ipod and this works perfectly. I have had one before which had survived 4 years of heavy daily use, and I'm sure this one will keep going too."
2,-morning after,This is the ultimate morning after disc. His rolling on the waves attitude and feel is unique and worth a repeated listening. Definately a must have!
2,Fast and Frothy,"This is a quality product that really works. I heat up milk or half and half in the microwave, use the frother, pour in my espresso, and enjoy my coffee. The price is right and it's faster than using my espresso machine to steam the milk."
2,Sturdy...well-made...looks great!,"Kitchens can be very ""utilitarian"" in feel. This will definitely soften things a lot. Holds a surprising amount of dishes, pots and pans, too. I added a clip-on silverware-holder (by same manufacturer). Feels like it will last a good, long time. Great purchase."
1,zipper busted second time i used it and can't return it,ziplock bags would be better than this thing. the zipper busted on the second zip. and i had it for 30 days until i used it so couldn't return it.
1,Costume,This costume was way TOO small for my eight year old! He's a regular size 8 so it's not like he's a big boy and I could barely get the thing on him. Sent it back over two weeks ago and still don't have my money back. Very disappointed.
2,great service,This was a bridal shower request. Your description and ease of selection were excellent! Packaging and delivery service were also superior. The bride to be was thrilled.
2,Moen Faucet L4621,Good fit for the sink we're using. Operates nicely using minimal projection into bowl area. No problems with installation. Saved about $45 versus local plumbing house.
2,The Litter-Emerge,"Released in early 1969, The Litter album ""Emerge"" is one of the great albums from the period when psychedelia merged into a heavier direction musically. I am reminded of a Lester Bangs article on heavy metal describing how mid 1960s garage bands transformed into hard rock/heavy metal later on and The Litter (much like MC5) fit this profile very accurately. The guitar distortion was still evident, but the tone was much sharper, guitar solos more abrasive and prominent, bass and drums, much deeper and the vocals are well mixed. The songs were longer (the epic ""Future of the Past"") and less radio friendly in a non underground FM sense, but are nonetheless memorable and powerful. The Litter could definitely hold their own among their American and British counterparts of the time when it came to raw energy and heaviness. I have had Emerge for decades on LP and was glad to finally get it on CD. A great find I have wanted to have on CD for years."
1,Wouldn't hold 13 pounds..... How are they supposed to hold 20?,"I wish I would have listened to the 2 star reviews.... But I went with these because the manufacturer of the speakers I bought (Ascend Acoustics) only sells these so I figured they HAVE to work. Unfortunately I was wrong, and to boot, I accidently tossed the boxes in recycling so I can't return them. Decent concept with poor execution. You simply cannot tighten the clamp tight enough to hold a speaker over 5 pounds. I tightened them as tight as I could and within a few minutes the speakers were drooping. I highly recommend bottom mounts if you have heavy speakers because these stink....."
2,City by the Sea,"This movie is Fantastic!!...Starring Robert DeNiro, Frances McDormand and JAMES FRANCO.....Filmed in Asbury Park, NJ ...near where I live, it is sooo well acted, so believeable and a good story.....I highly recommend this film...Patty"
2,"Really Useful Visuals, Especially at this Price!","[...], The visuals are really useful because they are ready to go and easy to use, I have been building my library and this is a great addition. I got the rest of my stuff from[...], great if you just want a few at a time."
1,Code Expired,"Received the frog and the code had an expiration date and was expired. I feel so bad for my daughter, because she bought it and couldn't even play it online."
2,good deal,"Both lights are insanely bright. I'm almost afraid to use them. The headlight does an okay job lighting the path ahead, could be better but is adequate. The taillight does an almost better job of lighting the path behind you. Bright!Would (and have) suggest to a friend."
1,Save your money - buy a bic!,"Not too happy with this purchase.The lighter did not look like the photo when received and it lit about five times before the fluid ran out. I was unable to refill it, eventhough I tried numerous times.Basically, with shipping and handling, I spent $20 for a lighter that barely worked & never will again. Don't waste your money ..."
2,Very nice looking.,I ordered 3 sets of these to be nameplates for my candle business. The description said that they came with a gold pen but mine had a black one which is fine. They are very easy to write on and just as easy to reuse. Just wash them off with a soapy sponge and they are ready to use again.
1,I expected much more,"It explain well the relationship between price and volume, but I expected more discussion on the technical indicators like stochastics, MACD, Williams %R,RSI, OBV ect... It doesn't cover well time frame that has to be used when reading technical indicators. And it doesn't show you how to combine the diferents indicators."
2,Beloved Musashi,"Japan loves the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi,and in this version Toshiro Mifune is absolutely charming. He acted in this at about the same time as Seven Samurai, if I am not mistaken, and surely he took a page from his 7 Samurai characterization of Kikuchiyo. His youthful Musashi is an animal!(he's not Musashi yet! He was still Takezo! He had to EARN his name!)But, he learns. And, though it takes three films to tell the tale, it is most enjoyable throughout. Mifune was young, handsome, at his physical prime, and a darn entertaining actor! Ok, maybe the director Inagaki is no Kurosawa. Still, if you like this genre, this is fun!"
1,swivel seat,Wish I had not bought it. Hard and uncomfortable. There have to be better products out there. Don't bother with this one.
1,a book about his personal life (not financial life),"I was disappointed. Even if you do want a book about Soros' personal life, the presentation was boring. It was doubly boring for me because I was hoping to learn something about his financial history. There is Shamefully little of that in there. Even the 1/3 of the book entitled ""Making Money"" was not about that. There are enough uncritical biographies written about his personal life. When is someone going to write a critical account of his financial history? That is the interesting part. There is the story. Too much about his philanthropy."
2,Re-readable,"I read books like a shark swims ... I keep moving, devour them, move on. Rarely I come across books that I reread, and fewer that I reread more than once. The Water is Wide is one of those re-readable books. I first encountered Pat Conroy's book when I was in junior high, and have returned to it again and again. Finding that it's been re-released, hopefully to gather a new audience, is encouraging to me. The book, written when the world, especially the South, was grappling with changes spurred by the Civil Rights movement. A white teacher, graduate of one of the premiere Southern military colleges, The Citadel, takes a position as a teacher on an island isolated from the most of the cultural changes in the United States. He introduces children to the joy of learning and to their place in the world. Conroy is a compelling writer, and gives life to his story and subjects."
2,Fun for mighty bean collectors,My first racetrack was this one and I had trouble setting it up but I did and it's really fun! The only thing is it has to be angled just right for it to work. A MUST for big mighty beanz collectors.
1,peice of crap,i had this when i was like 7 or 8 and the on of switch broke off. i had to stick a pencil in it and turn and wait till it turned on. if i were you i wouldnt even think of buying it
2,A definite breath of fresh air,"I saw this movie at the recommendation of a friend who is known for anime such as Akira or Ninja Scroll, and I was expecting to see the same thing. Instead, I what I got was a cross between Ranma and...I dunno, Escaflowne? Anyways, I really enjoyed it and I think that it would be very cool if they came out with more of them. It has definitely got potential. My only critique would be that there was one or two times they could have cut down on the boobage. I would definitely recommend this to you!"
1,Not for everyone,"I chose this based on reviews. The first 3 days were fine. 1 pill twice a day. Drank at least 8 cups of water. etc etc. 2-3 healthy BMs. Day four my stomach did a complete and horrible flip flop so as the label instructed, I stopped taking it. Unfortunately I did not have a BM for almost 5 days after that. Not fun. Took another pill hoping it would get me back on track and it actually did but not going to take anymore. Everyone's bodies are different and mine unfortunately did not react well to this pill."
2,A More Melodic Tori,"Sheila Nicholls has much of the phrasing of Tori Amos and Kate Bush, but her tunes are much more melodic and accessible. Strong piano and fine vocals highlight this delightful debut album."
1,2 stars is generous,"A live Asia concert broadcast in 12/1983 on MTV and radio in which Greg Lake flat-out couldn't replace John Wetton. This is an old CD, of a big show ... but these 3 to 4 star ratings are ridiculous. People {ELP fans}, on this CD can you not hear on the end chorus of ""Wildest Dreams"" Lake sounds like he's in a state of severe constipation? Forget music transfer or sound quality issues ... this ISN'T Asia. And the management and everybody tried to pull it off as if it was, at the time. The concert itself and the build up, up to it was one of the biggest scams the American music business had ever perpetrated on the public, particularly the people of Tokyo, who loved the band Asia so much they took it in whatever form they could get it. The release, ASIA Fanstasia: Live in Tokyo ... is the 'real deal' (Btw I am a big fan of Greg Lake, and have his double CD Retrospective)."
1,Very Dissapointed,"I chose this product based on the experience I have had with Amazon. I reviewed this set for possible inclusion in classroom training I conduct. The material is outdated and biased. I got a history lesson when I was expecting a timely presentation of the topic of terorism. It wouldn't be so bad as far as history lessons go, but the lessons were outdated. I am very dissapointed."
1,wouldn't purchase again,"There is very little contrast on screen, making words and letters hard to see. Also, most of the games move too fast for my pre-schooler, and hold absolutely no interest for my second grader. I wouldn't purchase again, even at Amazon's amazing price - sure glad I didn't pay $28 for this at Walmart!"
1,You too can do this...,"You too can make a CD just like this. Take any good musical CD and then whack it with a hammer a few times, drag a screwdriver over the surface, take a knife and cut deep grooves into the vinyl, and then play it. Your new creation will sound JUST LIKE this CD."
2,satisfactory,"moisturizing & fragrance are meet my expected. I am using the product now, and expect its moisture in the coming dry Spring season."
2,Left Behind,"Interesting concept. A little too obvious of a plot to be really engaging, but still a fun read. I haven't continued with the next books in teh series."
1,BORING!,"The overall quality of the singing and musicianship is very goodbut the songwriting is bad. My wife and I who love the first three albums just hated this one. Garbage! This album came out the same time as Deep Purple's ""Who Do We Think We Are"" which is considered a weak effort, but hearing this Partridge CD it sounds like a masterpiece."
1,"Horrible, horrible. Stay/buy Word 2003","Just bought MS Office 2007 for my new laptop. Opened Word and was shocked at the looks and functionality (simplistic, arcane, frustrating, non-intuitive). In addition, the documents that it generates (ending in .docx) can't be read by earlier versions of Word. Nice. MS touts this positively, but after checking reviews this afternoon, I have not found one positive review by users. I'm now trying to buy Word 2003 (I can't find my original Word 2003 download CDs). Horrible. Horrible."
2,Raally nice,"These are easy, light and comfy to wear, have all sorts of pockets, and, for a warm climate tech lizard. sweet."
2,The original Cowboy Hero,This is the begining of cowboy heros and stort lines. Long but would not cut a scene. After you watch this (if it is for the first time) you will see plots of your favorite spagheti western just waiting to be filmed. One of those movies that I will wear out from watching over and over.
2,i really have to say...,"For years I struggled to make a good cup of coffee at home. I worked all day in a restaurant directly behind the coffee machine, so a good cup of coffee was always at my disposal. However at home, it was a completely different story. I had previously gone through 2 machines as well as a french press (dont get me wrong, it makes a great cup of coffee, i just dont have the time!) So when I changed jobs and I no longer had that perfect cup behind me, well it was time to do some research. After carefully reviewing Braun, Hamilton Beach and this Cuisinart machine, I decided to go with the Cuisinart (besides, can nearly 400 good reviewers be wrong?) The answer is no, they were not wrong. The auto brew and 1-4 cup select, gave me just want I wanted, a perfectly brewed HOT cup of coffee. The instruction manual left a lot to be desired (no real set up instructions) but this machine shines where it clearly should."
1,Do they have any lower ratings?,"Could there be a worse game? Jet Force Gemini is highly overrated, it has bad graphics, the choice range for the weapons is small, and it has horrible control. ...I would rate this gave with a half star if I could!"
1,Does not retain smell,Smells good going on but disappears after about 1hour. Seemed like its watered down. Will not purchase from this vendor again.
2,Oldies but Goodies,"This has got all the old standards on it from when I was young, with a few of the newer artists, like Vanessa Williams, Martina McBride and Amy Grant. The only one missing is Bing Crosby's White Christmas."
2,Icons of the 1960s,"Good photography and a retreat back into the past, especially the 1960s, when the jet set was all the rage. While this book centers on Ms. Radziwill's life in pictures, it offers an interesting glimpse into an age long forgotten."
2,"Nice, inexpensive replacement","This is a nice, inexpensive replacement keyboard and mouse set. After a few days to get used to it, I have few complaints. One is that the software supplied does not work with Windows Server 2003. I had to search for an older version (3.1) of Setpoint that is compatible. Another issue is that the keys on the left side of the keyboard click as if they are bottoming out, while the keys on the right are pretty quiet. This was a little annoying at first, but not enough to warrant returning it. Finally, while all the F keys are programmable in ""enhanced"" mode, they've silkscreened some icons onto the first 8, like Word, Excel, print and save. If you reprogram those to suit your needs you have to learn to ignore those graphics. It would be nice if they left off the graphics and included a labeling strip that you could customize for your own set of applications or functions. Otherwise, this is a decent purchase."
2,She loves it!,"We wanted something gender neutral, check! We wanted a jumper that was safe, check! We wanted something she would still show interest in a month (or months) later, check! Our little girl looks like a ballerina in her Graco Jumper. She loves it. We love it. Happy customers."
2,LOVE IT!,"I absolutely LOVE my new Swiffer Sweep 'n' Vac! I have several dogs and cats, and the pet hair that collects in the corners and under cabinet overhangs is incredible. I no longer have to drag out my heavy vacuum cleaner and fool with the attachments to get under the cabinets or to change it from carpet to hard floor settings. The Sweep 'n' Vac is so lightweight and easy to use. It gets into the smallest spaces and corners - plus it does a double job of cleaning the floor with the Swiffer pads too! I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone with pets."
1,Can't imagine it only runs for 3 times...,"I can't believe that this product only runs 3 times, then the motor with spinning parts and blades are broken (besides the blades, all is plastic made). Noise is also unacceptable compare to Magic Bullet. I bought this because the container of Magic Bullet are too small, and I was going to make baby food for my daughter.Don't buy this product, you would definately disappointed."
2,Great Biblical instruction for a select group,"The book is an easy, pleasant read with wonderful Biblical instruction. However, if you do not fit specifically into the category of woman that this book is geared toward, you may not see the whole point of it. The book doesn't fully allow for the fact that God created human kind to serve Him in ALL that we do, i.e., the book focuses on how women can best serve God by working at home. And that's okay, you just need to know that before reading it.I purchased copies for friends in my Bible Study at church and they too enjoyed it to some degree. Overall, I would recommend this read to garner a different perspective from the world around us."
1,Garbage,"An incredible waste of money. A poorly put together, slow read. No value. You can have my copy. Pick up the book ""Boot"" for a naive view of police work. I thank Amazon for recommending Boot after I bought this waste. Boot redeemed their system. Thank you Amazon, sorry Bentley, pick a new trade, Godspeed"
1,this has problems,"I loved this when I first bought it, I hate cleaning the litter box. I even convinced several different people to buy this who had cats, but about 7 months after I bought this it broke. There is a little thin wire that can get wrapped around the rake and break. I didn't notice it because it happened one day when I was out. I came home to find it broken."
2,Grey's Anatomy,I am very happy with the quality of the DVD's. However the DVD case was broken and whoever packed it for shipping had to have known. I do not believe this was a shipping accident.
2,A modern hiphop classic!,"THIS IS A DOPE ALBUM!!!! I am new Latryx and the Qaunnum roster but this LP blew my mind the first time I heard it. NOT ONLY can LB rhyme his @ss off but he has this deeply funky singnig quality to his delivery. CALLING OUT is a song that truly displays his breath control, his lyrics, his delivery and his energy. IT is an incredible album! THIS IS A MODERN HIPHOP CLASSIC"
2,I like this movie,"I can't comment too much on the historical accuracy of this film. What I do know, however, is that I truly enjoyed it. It really made be feel for what it would be like to starve and/or freeze in the middle of nowhere with no help in sight. The lost cause. Always an interesting premise."
2,Good clean fun.,My son loves the Jetsons every bit as much as I did when I was a kid. And so do his friends. Very clean and nothing crude about it.
1,Does not work,This program installs and then runs one time before shooting out error messages. Not worth the trouble. Not even a customer service number to call.
2,Impressed,The book has been very useful. Good sound advice. Supports what my Dr. says---Move more and adjust what you eat. Addresses what needs to be done long term---not just another one of those fad diets.
2,Really adds to the movie,"InStargate: The Deluxe Edition, David Arnold does what a good soundtrack is supposed to do - add tension and excitement to the movie. To be honest, a movie about aliens in ancient Egypt could easily have descended into a sci-fi farce. The soundtrack makes the entire movie work. From the desert melodies to Ra's dark, powerful theme, the danger feels reel, and so does the plot. TheStargate: The Deluxe Editiononly adds to the film score with more tracks and remastered quality."
1,"Freezes, crashes, hardely works","I just purchased the Roq-it 10 GB from Amazon. Upon receiving the item, which was shipped promptly, I charged it, hooked it up to my computer. After downloading about 3 GB worth of music, I wanted to see how the device worked. After less than 10 minutes of playing music, it froze. Turned off, then turned on to try again. It'd play for a few mintues then freeze. Sometimes when I'd turn it on, the device would get stuck on the boot up screen. I just went to the Dlink website and there is no mention of this product. Not anywhere. No drivers, no firmware, no tech support, no product info."
2,Very good CD,"This album was recorded a couple of years ago and sold extremely well.The sound is near perfect and Russell 's voice although still young in terms of classical voices, still sounds strong and dramatic. A very good CD."
2,My faithful friend throughout my time at Cambridge,"Some of criticisms fired at this book are hard to understand, particularly the complaints that the math is too hard to follow. There's nothing that goes far beyond British high school (A-level) maths here and if you don't already know how to integrate 1/x you really shouldn't be studying subjects like thermodynamics that can only be properly understood at a quantitative level. Inevitably with so much crammed into a single volume some of the chapters lack depth, but it almost always gives a good foundation for further reading on everything from diffraction to colloids, while the thermodynamics chapters provide everything an undergraduate needs to know. Atkins was my faithful friend throughout my time at Cambridge and helped me get a Double First."
1,An unnecessary book!,"It might be fun to speculate about what history might have been like if .... . But this book is different. It confirms all - mainly British - prejudices about Germany and - this is unfair - makes the US part of it. Only Great Britain seems to be the root of democracy. It might have slipped Easterman's mind that the English invented the concentration camps when they fought against South Africa's independence. And they fought against a lot of peoples who wanted to be independent from the Great British Rule. I have always been a fan of Easterman's. But this novel is really bad, its plot lousy, its characters ludicrous. And his German is even more ridiculous. His worst novel."
1,sound and fury signifying nothing,"Part-serial killer thriller (which tiresomely tries to out outre previous entries), part-cop/buddy action film, and all parts tiresome. By this I don't mean it is any worse than most contemporary Hollywood fare -- in fact, those who like formula films may even enjoy themselves. Not surprisingly, the director -- who some may remember for once having made an interesting film -- went on from this to make his Hollywood debut (the stinker Gothika). This is film-as-advertising (film-as-tv-commerical): it's not about anything but selling itself. It made my teeth hurt."
2,Another good classics,"I chose this book because I have seen the movie and enjoyed it. The book makes me smile. There are many stories with drama and adventure, but this one is peaceful. I like that."
1,not as helpful as other books I've read on the subject,"this book is almost solely devoted to a diet which the author claims will help with the symptoms of fibroids, while not claiming to shrink them, etc. however, my doctor was appalled at the suggestions and the extremes suggested as far as eating habits. do yourself a favor, buy a different book to learn about treatment options, etc. this book was almost comical as far as feasibility in the lives of today's active women."
1,misleading,"Now I bought this thinking it was ""The next O.K. computer"" how wrong. This isn't anywhere near the level of Radiohead. Don't be sucked in. Instead use your money to buy Airbag/how am I driving, which is the B-sides to O.K. computer and the only worthy album held against O.K. computer."
2,Works as advertised,This is the best electric trimmer I've ever used! The edging/sidewalk wheel really allows for a straight edge on the lawn.
2,most solid solo effort to date,"This album is wonderful. As a long time Smith's fan I was a bit reluctant to pick this title up. Most of Morrissey's solo albums have some great songs on them, but for the most part they are all inconsistant, except this album. I am so happy that I gave it a chance. It is now one of my most favorite albums of all time. Please give it a chance. You wont be Dissapointed."
2,LOVED IT!!!,"I loved this book. I really enjoyed reading it. I couldn't put it down. My favorite John irving book is ""Widow for a year"", but this book is a close second. Way to go Mr. Irving!"
1,Disappointing,"32 000 photos to choose from, and this is what he comes up with?? Many of the pictures are black and white, out of focus and grainy. The panorama shots are very poorly composited from smaller pictures. I’ve seen much better seamless versions of the same photo series in other books. Numerous pages are simply empty. Just black. There are many great photos in this book, but they are too few to make it a good buy. A few google searches will turn up many more great photos than you will find in this book."
1,All Cult Classics Are Not Equal,"Hmmmm. I got talked into starting The Dark Tower by several friends who (a) know I have read most of Stephen King's work and (b) have taste that I largely agree with. So I've now made it through the first (short) book that makes up the seven-book series. I had started it many, many years ago and quickly abandoned it, finding it not up to his other works and just not interesting enough to make up for that. Having now finished it, I can say I think both of those facts remain true for me. It's too purposefully mystical and I think largely kind of silly (though not fun-silly). However. I'll continue with the series. I'll read the next book (which I've been told is infinitely better) and eventually probably read all seven. Because I'm that reader who, once he starts, finishes. Unless they start to feel like the kind of head-spinning fun-less work that this one was. At that point, I may abandon my quest. But for now, I'll give the impossible dream a shot."
2,Definitely not Lite Reading,"Engaging and comprehensive history of Russian Tsar Ivan IV (Terrible). The prose is very dense, and at times the information flow feels almost overwhelming - sometimes making me feel as if I should be taking notes :-) Scholarly and well done work about an extremely intriging individual and period in Russia. For a general audience, perhaps a more narrative prose style would be more accessible -- but an excellent work."
1,Are you kidding me?!?!?!,"America has gone mad! People are actually buying the worst album ever made in the history of mankind! I didn't buy the CD but I listened to it on a site and it was just agonizing to listen to it. I can't believe the record company will even give William hung a record deal. Why not give a record deal to all American idol failures. There are so many struggling talented artists who don't get recognition for years. And William Hung, who just sang one lousy song which was terrible (I have to admit it was funny) and get millions of dollars. I say that is plain unfair and the society have gone insane. I would expect that when Simon listens to the album, he would say ""..............horrific."" I advise you to not to buy the album it is the worst album ever made and it is the waste of your money. You should spend it on something worth buy."
2,Very Pleased!!,"shipping was quick, the order process was easy, seller answered ?'s and communicated well. overall, i am very pleased with the order."
1,"Bad (as in ""The Opposite of Good""","For those who can read and have, therefore, read Lovecraft's short story ""The Color Out of Space"" (not a short novel as described in the ad) you will notice from the description that this is not a faithful adaptation. Instead (as with so many of these) it is taking a Lovecraft story, having it re-written by a much less talented and inventive writer, and then putting the resultant mess on film.If you admire H. P. Lovecraft's work, don't buy this. You'd be better off buying the Boris Karloff, Nick Adams version 1965's DIE, MONSTER, DIE which, at least, comes closer to capturing the brooding horror of Lovecraft's style than THIS."
2,rating my coffee taste,i like the taste of the coffee better when it is brewed using coffee pods.i have tried them all but pods edges out the best of the ones i have used drip perc instant or french press
2,Great cd,"Aside from Kathleen Battle's abuse of vibrato on one track, I really enjoy this cd. It is more heavy on ballads and mellow songs, but there are a couple booty movin' tunes as well--Track 9 Marcus Miller funks it up!"
1,So So,"I don't have this album but my sister does and I've listened to it. The only songs that I think it's worth listening to are tracks 1,2,3,5, & 9. As for the remaining tracks, I didn't like the lyrics or the rhythm because they don't blend well with each other. Not only that, but I can hear it in the lead singer's voice that his heart wasn't really into these songs except for those 5 mentioned above. I've listened to their Super 20 and Continued album and I must say both of these are far better than this one. Thank goodness I didn't buy it."
2,Better Than Linksys,This unit is great and easy to set up but beware. This unit comes with a crossover cable and standard cat 5 cable. You must use the crossover cable if connection to a hub must be made. The instructions calls for the standard cat 5 to be used and this didn't work for me. Other than this the unit is easy to set up and works great. My internet connection even seems like it's going faster with the router as opposed to not haveing it. My friends purchased the 4 port Linksys and it locks up and has to be reset almost every day.
2,Couldn't put it down!,"I loved this book. I have read all of the Vampire Chronicles and the Witching series and to bring them together like this was great. I love how Lestat tells this story, great job!"
1,Defective copy,"This book was supposed to replace the worn copy that our four children and now our ten grandchildren loved. That book still has every page, but the binding is so worn out that it's more a stack of paper than a book.When I bought this replacement there was nothing mentioned by the seller that this copy would have the binding completely up side down. Lisa Lou is a protagonist who uses her brain power and work ethic to overcome every obstacle the swanp can throw at her. She deserves better than an up side down cover.I would give this copy zero stars, but the software requires at least one, which this copy did not earn."
2,Silicone Tongs,It works well with large pieces of food but bacon is very hard to turn over. I have smaller tongs that work for smaller pieces of food.
1,very disappointing,"Ever the optimist, I thought this would be a good purchase since I was looking for a heart rate monitor that was convenient (ie didn't have a chest strap). The watch seemed to work fine until I used it during a workout on my stationary bike. At one point, it said my heart rate was 212, in which case my chest should have exploded. At other times, I couldn't get a reading at all.Then a few times when I was wearing it sitting at my desk, I'd check my heart rate and find that it was 37. Now I have a low pulse rate and low blood pressure, but that's ridiculous. So I went back to wearing my Ironman watch and put it aside. I took it out this morning and the battery's dead!! It's less than a month old!!(...)"
1,Worthless,"Absolutely worthless book, unless you have really reached the bottom of your once successful career, or hold one of those ""corporate strategic BS management / leadership"" positions where you have to BS your way through to the management and colleagues all the time."
2,tub strips,As stated This is good for us so we don't slip in the tub. Staying on for 3 weeks already
2,Inheirt The Wind,"My class and I just finished reading this book today in class. I liked the book a lot. The only part I didn't like about the book was when Matthew Harrison Brady died. I don't like books that have death scenes in them, even though I know it is a reality of life. The book overall was really good! I suggest you read it! :) :) It's the first play I've ever read, but it rocks! :)~THE BOOK WORM~"
2,"One of the BEST ever, but DVD needs a re-release","Hands down, this is one of the best movies ever made, as well as one of my favorites. The DVD needs to be re-released for an improved version. The movie is on two sides, which is no good. The extras are limited. The movies sound and color are average. However, die hard GOODFELLAS fans would like a better version to enjoy. Perhaps with commentary tracks, interviews ect. This would give us more info about the real life events the movie is based on."
1,poor review guide,"Maybe it helped others, but it didn't help me. Only one of the fifty questions from the practice exam was remotely similar to one of the one hundred questions on the real test.Seemed helpful when I was reading it, but not like the actual exam at all.Find something else; I am."
1,Do Camarones Sound Like This Dipped in Boiling Water?,"The few cuts with the Royal Philharmonic save the album from complete disaster. Nothing is good. The arrangements are unimaginative. The accompaniments add nothing positive. As for Camaron's vocals, I wouldn't listen to this again if you paid me. My dog howls better."
1,nope,"Didn't like it-!!!!!!!! Too many songs , more of a musical than the regular awesomely funny show. If you like musicals go for it,although it's no Book of Mormon"
1,Remastering misses the mark.,I have a very discerning ear and I was deflated to say they least when I listened to these releases. I have these both on LP and on the original CD releases. These are defining albums for a solid rock band that went ballad goey in '76 after R.E.O. Typically when you pick up something remastered you expect a cleaner recording with better separation in the sound. These sound flat and very uninspiring for the listener. The LPs still sound the best!sk
1,Worst movie of the year,I order this movie just to see what is was about. A very poor documentary on Saddam. I wouldnt wish this movie on anyone!!!
2,"Hate the Pictures, Love the Book!","I'm trying to design a small log home. The photos in this book are very...very contemporary. Forget the photos if that's not what you're into and read the book! A friend originally lent this to me a couple of years ago. I've been in a blockage in working on my future floor plan and thought I'd pick this one up again - it was worth it! This is the first ""picture book"" you'll read all the way through. It just really makes you think about the space you need...and when it all boils down to it you find out you don't need that much; you just need to use it a little more wisely."
1,Hmmmmm...,This is a good albumn?? It's worth about as much as it cost the record company to make. Boo...
1,Not their greatest hits,"You must go back to the 1967-1969 Bee Gees era, before Robin left, in order to bask in the best of the Bee Gees. Glorious pop, each album: 1st, Horizontal, Idea, & Odessa. These are the essential Bee Gees albums. The collection here contains, of course, their later disco/bland pop period, and is, frankly, tiresome, especially when compared to their marvelous, quirky art pop of the late 60s. They were never quite the same after Robin split in 1969, and this 70s-80s stuff proves it in spades."
2,Great product!,"Different than the ""old"" Polar transmitters, the WearLink is very light and esay to transport. You don't have to worry about bending or flattening it like in the past. Just fold it, toss it in your backpack and go.It works just as well as the older versions."
2,Not a gamer,"Blazing Angels 2 is a fun game.It's one of the rare games that is fun and has a storyline. If you kill a character, it's for a good reason. I like that in a game."
2,Fun 80s album!,"One of Billy Ocean's best releases, this album features a nice mix of funky upbeat cuts (""Stand And Deliver"", ""Gun For Hire"") and romantic ""Quiet Storm"" ballads (""The Colour Of Love"", ""Here's To You""). The highlight of the album is the FULL-LENGTH version of the huge hit ""Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car"" (the version on his Greatest Hits CD was a shorter radio edit). This album is filled with fun pop music, but there are enough sophisticated touches to keep it interesting (such as a trumpet solo on the uptempo song ""Pleasure""). For fans of elegant 80s music, this will be a nice addition to your collection."
2,I can see better.,Great and easy install. Highly reccomended. No problems as previously seen in reviews. I am very happy with this mirror.
1,oxymoron .. is there a 0 star?,"gee.. putting science and theology together is oxymoron .. where is the demarcation of science? the author doesn't even know! it is typical of people who would like to take credits along with the word 'science' but do not want their own claims to be subjected to scientific methodology. If the author means Spinoza's Pantheism, it would not be the same theology everyone else would hope it to be. A typical feat of mixing up facts and hopes. I regret wasting time on it!!!"
1,not what I had hoped for,Too many characters who did nothing to help themselves. Who can feel sorry for someone when all they do is wallow in their miserable circumstances? Also a very disappointing ending to all their grief.I would not recommend this book.
1,I don't trust this book,"This book at times seems like nothing more than a 130 page advertisment for Snap-On tools. The authors are so in-your-face about it I almost question their impartiality: Are these adjustments and measurments they recommend really necessary or is it just that Snap-On makes a nice new - and very expensive - tool that they are trying to sell to help you do it? I don't know.It's really pretty silly considering that if I could afford Snap On tools I wouldn't have bought this book in the first place. I would have just driven my Camaro to John Lingenfelter's shop and told him to build me a smokin' 383, drop it in, and let me know when it's done."
1,Are You Ready?,"This book is a must-read for all open-minded erotica lovers. The story is full of twist and turns and keeps you on your toes from the first page. Sit back and enjoy this journey of a woman'sdetermination to win the heart of her lover, who happens to be a woman. I hope you're ready for this one...remember to keep an open-mind!! sorry reviewers. I mistakingly gave this book 1 star, my intentions was to give it 4 stars..sorry!!!"
2,All Kids should read this book!,A 'coming of Age' story for the younger set. Amusing and turbulent at just the right level for the story as well as the readers for which it is intended. Anyone with crazy family dynamics of siblings (especially a younger brother/sister) will relate and embrace the adventures of Pee-Tah! Judy Blume nails it with this one.
2,Dark Humor and Chills!,"When I first bought a copy of this book I expected it to be a horror story-which it is-but it has an added bonus...it's also very funny! Don't get me wrong now, it's a very dark kind of humor, but nothing too corny or too bloodthirsty. I'd give it a PG-13 rating in terms of adult content, although it certainly has its very weird and freaky moments. The Headless Horseman is very wicked, and the characters who try to hunt him down are a peanut gallery, ranging from wacky professors and priests to college drop-outs and trigger-happy cops. The plot is excellently twisted and then unwound at a lightening pace at the end. You'll need to catch your breath at the conclusion of this one - I felt like the Headless Horseman had just chased me down the street."
1,Atmospheric but Empty,"Early 70's Pink Floyd is evoked and outright copied here on the first two tracks. ""Circulation of Events"" is a worthwhile piece of dissonent electronic music, foreboding and pulsing. ""Wahn"" is strange manipulation of vocals straight out of Pink Floyd's ""Several Species of Small Furry Animals ..."" off ""Ummagumma"". Highly derivative."
2,Recommend this.,"This film was better then first in my opinion.Even though the first film was the break through,this film made it better and definately diservse a sequal."
2,Good YA Sci-Fi,"Second in the Trilogy. Tally becomes a Pretty, but it's not everything that she thought it would be. Somehow she has thought her way out of being Pretty-Minded and is once again out to find the New Smoke to join them, to help them and to live a life outside of the City. She and Zane risk their lives to join up with David only to find out that the Specials have a whole new way to find them. Tally once again betrays and is betrayed. I'm enjoying this series. I'm not much of a science fiction reader, so to me this is Sci-Fi-Lite. This book took a little longer to get going, but the story did move a long. Hopefully book 3 will answer the questions."
2,No fail Vegan cooking book!,"This was the first Vegan cookbook I purchased about 4 years ago. I did not use it until I actually adopted a plant-based diet. Every recipe I have made has been delicious, and it is very easy to follow. It is not at all complicated. I am so sorry it is out of print. I purchased all of the books that the book store had on sale to use as gifts for people wanting to switch over to a healthier lifestyle. When I first began giving cooking classes, this was the text book. All of the recipes came from this book for my demonstrations, and everyone loved them."
1,Once Upon a Review,"This is the kind of movie that somebody's grandmother might get for their daughter so that the parent in question can pawn off the responsibility of raising his daughter on some awful movie. Then, when the child comes to him upset and with questions he can say that he ""innocuously"" put it in the DVD player thereby further removing himself from any blame. Perhaps he can then direct his daughter to another awful video about death and dying."
2,"A Fine Novel, But Not A Literary Masterpiece","Jonathan Franzen's ""The Corrections"" is undoubtedly the finest depiction of a dysfunctional family I've come across in fiction. He is a splendid writer with a keen sense of imagination and excellent literary style, and he has wrought a marvellous achievement bringing the Lambert family to life. However, I found too many of the family's problems seem a bit too contrived, most notably, the strange odyssey which Chip Lambert undertakes from academia to new-style Russian organized crime in Lithuania. I agree with a previous reviewer that Franzen should have chosen another part of the former Soviet Union, not Lithuania; surely the Central Asian republics or Georgia might have been more ideal locales. Still I must commend Franzen for his enthusiastic, often satirical look, at contemporary society. However, I strongly doubt that ""The Corrections"" is the literary masterpiece of our time; it is clearly an accolade that veers too closely to hyperbole."
2,even my girlfriend grooved on it,"This is an explosive piece of work. The bass and drums would be enough to carry any other recording, then throw in the trippy guitar playing of Tom Morello and Zach lyrics and what you have is the album of the year. Sorry Limp Bizkit"
1,"Blues, not swing","The rough vocal style and raunchy lyrics in this album are more typical of blues than swing, and if that's what you like, fine. The musical composition is more upbeat and genre-defying than stereotypical blues riffs, but if you were expecting to hear swing music, you'll be sorely disappointed. Give me Benny Goodman any day."
1,Dressy watch,I bought this watch to wear at my Son's wedding. It is pretty and keeps perfect time. Just what I wanted.
2,FABULOUS!,"Feiler's account is sensitive and goes deep. A beautiful journey with a writer who can convey what he sees and hears with great poignancy and depth. Another great book of his, ""learning to Bow""!"
1,Works until it doesn't,"Fail! This thermometer works great. Then it doesn't. We had it for one year in New England. Worked through the humid heat of summer and the nightmare winter. Then, it looked like it needed a battery replacement. Got a new battery, and found that it wasn't the battery, but the unit that had just gone haywire. For the price, I expected a few years. Maybe it is good for a year, but I'm sure there are others that you can install and forget about."
1,Beware of hidden glutamates.,"This is a high quality product with nice flavor but the label is misleading. This tuna is not packed in water, it is packed in so-called vegetable broth which sounds innocent enough unless you are the type of person that gets headaches after eating in a chinese restaurant. This soy broth is like virtual MSG. MSG deadens portions of your tastebuds that tastes rotten or fishy flavors and causes tumors in lab mice.If you can eat MSG/Glutamates without any problem this is an excellent product and the pouch is very convenient. I am sorry to see that Amazon no longer carries Starkist tuna in a pouch packed in sunflower oil. Their sunflower oil packed tuna is by far the best tuna I have ever eaten and would reccomend to any tuna lover."
1,no good,"It has nothing to do with the sales person who sold this, but the product is un safe with out a thumb guard. To dangerous and too hard to usse. I sent it back and I am not even sure now if I got credit for it. Did I?"
2,per and marie's humble beginings.,"it's hard to believe that way before ""pearls of Passion"" and the first major hit album ""the look"" the roxette duo were at it trying to create an album that would compliment their powerful voices.heartland cafe is very different cos it has per on lead vocal and marie as back up. It seeems that per didn't have much confidence as lead vocal and in some parts of this album it shows.but we have to relise that they are only starting out and still in the process of finding out what works and what doesn't.the songs on the album are strong and i like per's style of writing but some line's lyrically annoy me deeply and i think sometimes he could of made a bit more effort refering to ""have a nice day"".but if your a roxette collector this is the album to have."
1,Absolute garbage,"What was Denzel Washington thinking? This films plot is a complete mess. There is no flow between ANY of the scenes and the film doesn't even have a shred of credibility as to how circumstances unfold.The problem is this, the film sets the stage as being a realistic, intelligent, suspense thriller, and then doesn't deliver ( at least not the first two ). The story goes way out there, as not a single police officer/agent is doing their job correctly, as well as not a single person acting with any rationale at all. In fact, can anyone make any sense of any one's motives when all is said and done?I felt let down more so than some others may be, being a huge Denzel Washington fan as well as a suspense thriller enthusiast.Oh and be prepared to nod off to sleep every so often, this movie is soooooo predicatable most of the time and the dialogue so cliched, you can probably miss half of it and still recite it line by line.I can't recommend this to anyone, not even people I dislike."
2,"Love the phone, hate the battery life!","Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos! I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday! Perhaps I just got a bad battery but I've NEVER had to charge any phone daily. Keep in mind that I leave my phone on 24/7. Maybe I should turn it off. Does anyone else have this same syndrome?If you're a shutterbug like me, you will love this phone. I didn't even mention the hot pink/magenta color which all gals love.One note of caution, If you live in hurricane alley like me, you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they don't take down the cell phone towers before the storm. It may be useless locally but you can at least tell your people you're still among the living and need money to escape the carnage!"
1,MISSION OF HONOR - NOT,"THIS IS AWFUL. THIS IS NO TOM CLANCY BOOK. EVER READ A WHOLE BOOK AND AT THE END THOUGHT WHAT WAS THIS ???WHAT WAS THIS ABOUT? WHAT WAS THIS AS A STORY? WHO CARES? THIS IS AWFUL, MORE THAN AWFUL. IF THERE WAS A MINUS MINUS MINUS I'D PUT IT ON THIS MISERABLE BOOK. I LOVE CLANCEY AND I THINK THIS ""FRANCHISE IDEA"" THAT HE HAS ONLY WORKS IF THE AUTHOR KNOWS HOW TO WRITE, HOW TO TELL A STORY...THIS IS STUPID. I'M GOING TO TOSS IT IN THE TRASH SO NO ONE ELSE IN MY FAMILY OR GROUP OF FRIENDS GETS CAUGHT READING IT, HOPING FOR SOME PAYOFF AND GETTING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING...THIS REMINDS ME OF A BOOK WRITTEN BY A COMMITTEE...OF IDIOTS."
1,They just keep getting worse...,"This series has been going downhill for ages, but this latest is truly the worst..what a preposterous book! Read at your own peril!"
1,Hated it.,It was old and almost grainy.. the information was very basic. this is a 30 year old video .Not what you want to learn with. I suggest something else that is more up to date.
2,Superior Book,"This is one of the ""bible"" books for anyone looking to improve their flycasting skills. I am a FFF Certified Casting Instructor and use many of the ""Tips"" from within this book."
1,Parents beware,Preview this CD before you let your teens and younger listen. You'll have a lot of explaining to to otherwise. Explicit language and content
1,The worst!!!,"Don't expect to ever pour from the dispenser without spilling tea all over the place...especially when it's full. Also, don't bother e-mailing customer serice. They won't respond! I've tried it!!! I'm going with Hamilton Beach"
1,Probably my least favorite Koontz book.,"I found the first three-fourths of the book boring and slow moving. I normally love Koontz, but I do not recommend this one."
1,Looking Forward to Death... while listening to this album.,"First off, where's the Mutt Lange producing? Awful sound... everyone knows that the slicker it sounds, the more punk it is (take Green Day's ""American Idiot"" for example). Once you get past the initial shock of the goatboy whaling vocals, you'll realize that there isn't enough about suburban angst and too much anarchist claptrap. Anarchist punks? How original! I wish there would be a right-wing punk scene.. sigh. Anywho, everything here seems to be taken out of the ""How To Be a Punk"" Wikihow page, almost verging into the ""poser"" territory.Save yourself the headache and listen to Blink-182, Sum 41, The Offspring or Bowling For Soup instead."
2,Impressive for its day and still worth a look,"This style of filmmaking was soon to be outmoded. The story is presented as separate scenes, each introduced by a title, then enacted. The camera rarely varies its position during a scene. The movies still had a lot to learn, but there is much of interest to see here. The scenes are often beautifully framed and photographed, and there is mounting tension as the eruption nears and the horrors ensue. This is definitely a historical curio, but deserves to widely seen and acknowledged as a stepping stone to INTOLERANCE and all the many subsequent historical epics."
1,Saxophone,I doubt my 4 year old grandson will be able to bow enough air through it to make much music.
1,XXL classic??,"This album got a classic rating in XXL magazine and has received 5 stars by many reviewers. Maybe I was sucked in by the hype, but by no means is this a classic album. Several hardcore Clipse fans bought this album on the first day and shared my dissappointment. There are 5 really good songs on here (tracks 3,5,7,8,11), but the rest really aren't that great. I just can't believe all the hype this is getting through the net and magazines?? Are they listening to the same album? Clipse's mixtape ""We Got The Remix"" is 10x better than this. Check that out if you wanna hear some classic Clipse. In the meantime, look out for this cd used in a FYE or Coconuts near you....I already sold mine."
1,Very dry political history,".This book is not, as the title claims, ""a history"" of Argentina in the 20th century. Rather, it is a litany of presidents of Argentina during that time period. It details how they got the office and how they failed.There is nothing, as another review has noted, of the people. None of their stories. How did the dirty war feel? What was living with hyperinflation like? Defending Argentina on Goose Green--how did that solider respond?There is nothing about culture, art, music, food, literature. I suspect Argentina--and her history--are much larger than her presidents.Frederick Lewis Allen used to write (US) history, combining both the presidents and the people. It would be great to find a book about Argentina in that style. This is not that book."
1,"Bah, humbug!","Fresh off their success with Abacab and the self-titled album, Gene$i$, with Phil Collins at the fore, foisted this banal, over-commercialized tripe on the world. The album's highlights are the driving Domino and the quirky instrumental The Brazilian, both of which hint at Genesis' art-rock past. The rest of the album is sadly infested with forgettably cheesy techno-pop. A worthwhile comparison is with ex-member Peter Gabriel's ""So"" - released at about the same time - which clearly shows that a commercially positioned release can nonetheless make a significant artistic statement. Artistically, Invisible Touch largely stands as a disgrace to the Genesis legacy, albeit highly beneficial to their wallets. I implore anyone new to Genesis to start with Second's Out, which showcases the band's true skills as writers and musicians"
1,Oh boy. Another rewrite of the manual.,Don't bother with this unless you pirated the software. Then you deserve whatever you ger.
2,Elite Metal,"Good 90s release by veteran German power metal band Helloween. If you like high pitch falsetto, look no further. One of their better albums in their career. They are pioneers of the genre. Key tracks are: Push, Falling Higher, Hey Lord and I Can. I would recommend it to metal fans."
1,Do not buy this product!!!,"I am extremely disappointed with this product. After using the 1 package of film that is provided, I found it impossible to find film for it. I called Radica Games to complain; only to find out this product has been discontinued. It has been discontinued because Polaroid now distributes this film only on a limited basis. Limited basis means that it is on its way to being phased out. This film is available on line or at a few retailers (but that does not mean you will find it in stock). I find it reprehensible that Amazon and Toy R Us are still carrying this product and selling it for full price knowing the product has been discontinued and not informing the consumer. Buyer beware!!"
2,"Essential Reading for Philosophers, Parents and Psychology Students","I first picked up this book for a university assignment on Irvin Yalom and was amazed that I had got through an undergrad degree in psychology without hearing about him. This book is so interesting and accessible and I immediately clicked with his ideas and approach. Yalom comes across as very knowledgeable, explaining and challenging theories of psychology and how they support or contrast to the existential approach. He offers much practical advice and food for thought. The book is very enlighting for parents in regards to how children perceive and deal with death. There has not been enough written on that subject. I have almost finished reading the book and when I do I plan to start reading it all over again."
1,LionBoy needs a bit more 'spunk',"Two other students and I read the book LionBoy, by Zizou Corder. We thought that this book needed to have more description, action and explanation. There are many questions left at the end of this book.This book starts off when Charlie Ashanti, the main character, comes home to find his parents have dissappeared. Following a mysterious note, Charlie sets out on an adventure. We thought that this book needed more spunk, and it needed to be more understandable for kids. M.F., G.G., N.V."
1,Lost opportunity,"Intimate glimpses of Gettysburg in history and marking the lives of its residents today, mingled with echoes of the several wars that mark the novel's characters: a fine idea for some other writer, but way beyond the skill of this one. We have too many characters for this short novel and all presented through the single, distinctly feminine, High Romantic voice of the author. Not a novel to persuade one to suspend disbelief. Not sure what the reviewers' stars are all about."
2,PC Memory,"Product fits machine and works great. The package arrived sealed, on time, and functions correctly i have no issues at all. If I needed any more PC memory I would order from this company again. I have nothing more to comment so this is the end of my review."
2,Still producing fabulous photos,"I have had this camera since July 2007. I am a point and shoot person with little real knowledge of photography. This camera, however, makes me look like a pro. The photos are clear and crisp with billiant colors. At maximum zoom across a football field the detail is clear and perfect. I now have to wrestle my camera away from my daughter (somehow the camera now lives with her) who uses it to take photos of my grandson's sports and school activities. She posted some of the football photos on Facebook and got rave reviews on the great quality of the picutures. The s700 Turned out to be a great camera for a miminmal investiment with no performance problems."
2,One of the Best Books on Tennessee Williams,"It's a crime this book is so little known even by admirers of Tennessee Williams. Although published by an academic publishers, it's a straightforward biography, deeply researched and printed on excellent paper stock with many rare photographs. Mr. Williams' sad personal decline and personal shortcomings are not ignored but this clear-eyed book also celebrates the genius that he was. This is one of the best written accounts on the greatest playwright America has ever produced."
2,Almost Perfect,"The first half of this film is breathtaking in its pacing, cinematography and narrative style...while the second half isn't as good its still better than most ""oscar caliber"" films out there...generaly i strongly dislike movies with superficial twists but this one didn't seem to bother me...while not always completely intelligent it carries its message well...the ultimate in entertainment...deserves more credit than it got"
1,Couldn't End Fast Enough for Me!!,"This film was TRULY painful to watch!! The scenes seemed totally unrelated and character development was weak so it was impossible to connect with or really care about any of the characters. Also, I am surprised that this dark, gloomy, bizarre and somewhat scary movie is rated ""G"". The scene where Pinnocchio is eaten by the whale was too much for my 3-year old. What was up with the ""Blue Fairy""??-- I never understood her relationship to Pinnocchio. AWFUL, AWFUL movie-- don't spend money to see this one! Worst thing I've seen in a very long time! I'd pass on the video release also, but at least with the video you could FF to the end!"
1,Thoroughly disappointing,"This book was a disappointment from start to finish. Written by a non-professional (the author is the wife of a senior Turkish diplomat as is repeatedly impressed upon the reader and furthermore needed the assistance of a co-author to get the project completed), what we have here is more a vanity publication than anything else. The recipes show a lack of feeling of genuineness and demonstrate unpleasant presumption and lack of respect both for the cuisine and for the reader. Killer example: in the explanation of terms, tahini is explained and then the suggestion made that a cup of tahini may be replaced by 2/3 cup of peanut butter mixed with 1/3 cup of oil. This revolting (and culturally and ethnically wrong) advice sets the tone for this sad excuse for a cookery book. My recommendation for the real thing: get The Sultan's Kitchen by Ozcan Ozan, a professional restaurateur."
2,THIS IS A BOOK EVERY COLLEGE STUDENT SHOULD GET!,AGAIN A WONDERFULL BOOK BY KAPLAN A MUST TO BUY !!! SEZALLO
2,Stay In Place Strapless Bra,"I love the bras. The only thing is when you are a small cup size, the bra trys to pancake the boobs. I think one of the chicken cutletts (Boob Inhancer, bra stuffer) woudl fill you out just alittle. I'm keeping all 4 of mine.Kathi, Milwaukee, WI"
1,Not Recommended,"I've found that this toy falls apart very easily, and is very unstable to use for little hands. My daughter cannot put Kelly in the swing and ""buckle"" the safety strap; it's difficult for even an adult to secure the strap. The slide is constantly coming apart from the swing-set base. Kelly's ability to play peek-a-boo is limited; her arm barely reaches her ear, let alone her eyes. We have yet to be able to coordinate the noises from Barbie while Kelly swings. My daughter is playing more with the dolls themselves than the swing set. I would not recommend this toy."
2,the secret,This book needs to be in everyone's book collection. Ironically the secret is not so much a secret in the literal sense of the word. It implys that it is a secret to us because our society has long forgotten the true meaning of life. Or the true notion of manefastation.Love from Both Sides: A True Story of Soul Survival and Sacred Sexuality
2,Enjoyable workout,"If you are looking for a video that helps tone your arms, I would recommend this DVD. I don't consider it a great workout for abs or legs, but definitely feel the burn in the arm and shoulder muscles. Ellen Barrett is cheerful and encouraging without seeming annoying, and working out barefoot is very appealing. You won't find serious cardio here, but my heart rate was elevated and I worked up a slight sweat. I notice after this workout, I feel very flexible and relaxed, instead of the exhaustion I normally feel after working out. The other reviewers are correct: the background music is annoying and strange. Once you have the workout down pat, mute it and just follow along with your own music!"
2,"Bring it back, I'm sorry I waited!","I received this machine from a friend long ago and thought it was pretty silly, it looks like a fiendish thingie, but one day I decided to have a laugh and got it out. To my astonishment this thing really works! From that day on, and I cook with a lot of garlic, I used it steadily and happily. Alas, it broke one tine but still worked pretty well then I broke a second tine and that was the end of it. I have had several products lately that were great products but have gone out of production. So strange because I have always believed that great products would be supported. Not the case. I would buy another in an instant but I gave it only 4 stars because it broke. Twice. I did not put it in the dishwasher either!"
2,A must-have,"Got a dog? You need this. Only thing is I wish I would of gotten the smaller size. The pictures make it look slightly larger than a coffee mug, but its closer to the size of a paint can. We have a schnauzer and we have to push her paws to one side to insure the mud is rubbed off."
1,What a P.O.S.!!,"I have trouble even believing that the folks who wrote reviews of this camera ever used it. I bought it to replace a Canon Sure-Shot (which I lost). There is basically nothing good about this camera. It takes too long to work, has no audio on the video mode, and the images (both still and video) are terrible. I am absolutely returning it to the vendor, and have no intention of trying any other camera products from Fujifilm."
1,It's a great book for anyone who belives in Santa Clauss,"It's a garbage. This book is a example of pseudoscience knowledge. There are only points of view that are not suported by the science. If you want to buy illusions, buy it. Otherwise, I recommend ""The Demon-Haunted World : Science As a Candle in the Dark"" by Carl Sagan. ""While he touches on various sorts of pseudoscience and antiscience, including repressed memories of all sorts, creationism, belief in miracles and, to his credit, the claims of tobacco companies that cigarettes have not been shown to be harmful, Mr. Sagan's primary target is the widespread belief in alien abductions . . . he is seldom wrong . . . [and] he always writes clearly. ""(The New York Times Book Review, James Gorman)"
2,Great band!,"I first heard JS when they played a free show at my school and my boyfriend made me go--and I've been hooked ever since. We went and saw them in Oakland recently, and they are such an awesome live band, better than the other 5 that were there, and their CD is great. I could listen to it over and over again, and the guys are great. Chris (the drummer) gave me points (and a hug) for being the best dancer on the drum riser. :DBuy this CD!"
2,Decent CD but a little whiney,The recording quality is great. Songs are well though out and performed. Dave is starting to get a bit whiney in his singing though.
2,Best TV i've owned to date.,"I did several months of research and comparisons before pulling the trigger and spending 4 grand on a TV. But it was well worth it. This Mitsubishi has the best picture and features of everything that I looked at. My only complaint is that after spending that money, my wife felt she had to go out and match me dollar for dollar for the wall entertainment center to put it in."
2,A masterpiece you will remember for years,"I liked this much more than A suitable boy. Seth finally shows fiction the prose he is capable of and his wonderful ability to create the world of artists, far away from political noise and other distractions of the modern world. Its a delight to read about the musicians, all of whom are brilliantly characterized and the lives they all come from to come and sit together to make music. This is a much better book than Ground Beneath Her Feet. Sure footed and lyrical in its gentle observations."
1,not what I expected,"I heard this was a bangin' album so I decided to cop it. Beats is mad weak on this joint and Roy Jones Jr should have sticked to boxing, my boy can't spit rhymes to save his life. I you like real hip hop this won't do it for ya this is one of the worst disappointments of the year. Best song is Ballers, but even that shiz is weak. Body Head Bangers? More like Boring Head Sleepers. Reprezent!"
2,Geat item. It's helping me with my weak hands. Thank you!,I noticed weakness in my hands at the gun range. I was told by my gun instructor to purchase hand exercisers to help build the strength in my hands. I purchased this item and it has helped immensely. Great and inexpensive way to accomplished my goals.
1,wish I saved my receipt!,"In the beginning, the chime worked maybe 40% of the time, and now not at all. I bought this to keep my cat out of a room and a flashing red light with no loud chime does not deter him at all. Waste of money...definately going with another brand next time."
2,Great Lens,Finally! I got this lens and its everything I thought it would be. Sharp! Easy to use and just great!
1,Best in the Biz,"This hydronic zone valve has 3/4"" sweat fittings and a N.O. switch that is used to turn on a 12V or 110VAC pump when the valve opens fully. Ordering & shipping was fast & easy - although installation was not included :)"
2,Nutritional Healing,"This book takes on a diverse number of topics and covers it in a logical and organized way. It is easy to use as an encyclopedia. Just look up what bothers you and learn a little about the topic. Each ailment comes with a brief discussion; including discussion on herbs, vitamins, food, etc, that will assist in healing and treatment. I think this book is a good reference book- a first stop for ""what ails you"". In most cases I think that reading more on each topic would be necessary, but it is nice to have all of that information condensed and available in one place."
2,What you see it's what you get,"This shoe looks the same at the screen and your feet. It runs a smaller than true size, specially because it's a close-flat shoe. Good quality, like all Hypes."
1,G.O.A.T?,"This album is ok, but I don't think it's worthy of the title G.O.A.T (greatest.of.all.time). Songs like ""Imagine That""(track 2), ""LL Cool J"" (track 4), ""Take it off"", ""Homicide"" (track 13) are all good. But the best is "" "" with Kelly Price (track 12). However he is a good rapper. This album is equal to phenomenon in my mind. ...."
1,Pushing the limits of silliness,"I didn't think the book was all that funny. It's humor is outdated and pushes the limits of silliness sometimes. There was some entertainment, but all in all I would pass next time."
2,King Ghidorah and Mothra!,this two pack features Godzilla fighting Two of his most famous combations KING GHIDORAH and MOTHRA. the movie are apart of the heisei era of godzilla (the 80's - 90's godzilla movies)
2,Escaflowne is alright,I like it because of the storyline. A good story is all that matters. I hate sub vs. dub debates. A good anime transcends language and age barriers. I like the film quality of Escaflowne but most anime is overrated. Ignore sub vs. dub debates. A good anime will not be altered by the voiceovers it will be more believeable and connect with the audience better.
2,this book is bsaic issue in recruit training,"The ""guidebook"" as we marines call it is generally part of the basic issue in recruit training... it details what should be known and learned throughout the training process (may also be used as a refresher). Unfortunately I've only seen one copy of the Marine Corps Reserve version during my entire career, which for some of us is a better book."
1,This is a book for home use for a pro program,"don't know how long it's been since I've been so disapointed in a book. Here's the problem. Photshop is a fully featured program for professionals. This book spends way too much time on filters that you won't normally use and not enough time on what you really need. I went out & bought the book right after I got the program a few weeks ago. At the time it was all that I could find, but it has little or no info on creating & using actions, styles or macros. It doesn't teach you the fast ways to do tasks. I learned a bunch more from The Photoshop Wow book which also has a CD of really great styles & actions. Photoshop 7 Down & dirty tricks is also great."
2,cool but not the best of the series...,"i buy this movie to complete my collection of the pirates....the sound is ok, no the best in the format. the picture quality was awesome (in the box said 1080i) but no, the picture on my lcd run 1080p prestine picture, i gess is a mistake in the box..ok in the film the acting of deep is funny to me...the history so-so...i recomend this blu only if you have the pirates 1 and 2..i am a fan ok..i like more pirates 1 y 2."
2,Quick Reference,"This is a great booklet that has 35 pages about English grammer and writing. It is short, concise, and thorough. It comes with three holes on the side to fit into a notebook. Great product."
1,Not good.,"Here we are the 2nd week of school and turns out I was sent the WRONG book. And, as it's not anything I thought to check-via the publisher page listing of the ISBN number, I don't have any of the return shipping labels required for me to return this book. So I'll get to purchase the book again.ISBN should have been 0130366145 and I got ISBN 0131663054 which is missing 2 full sections required for the course."
1,Full of grammatical errors,"So full of grammatical errors that I even question the substance of the book. And, no, I'm not an English teacher."
2,Wounderful Movie,"I see this movie in Zurich movie theater and was impressed from the beginning. Its fast, funny and also sad. but allround, i just went the next day to find the soundtrack CD, i bought it and enjoy listening to most of the songs. Than i stumbled unto the DVD and bought it also. All the special features are great and give an insight of the making of.I liked the actor who performed the duke? the rich man who should finance the moulin rouge anyway, his facial expressions are damn fantastic.Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor have wounderful voices, i love to hear their songs.All in All, i would recommend to buy this movie."
2,His Best,"I have all of TP's albums except for a couple of his most recent releases -- ""Wildflowers"" and ""Echo"" -- and I have to say that Full Moon Fever is the one I enjoy the most.From the opening guitar hook of ""Free Fallin',"" you know you're in for a good time. Man, how does this guy do so much with only three or four chords?? Great!"
1,Not what I was looking for,"I ordered this and I will return this ASAP.Maybe I just imagined it differently but I`m very dissapointed.I wanted something that is soft and cotton,but this is just another layer of plastic.The mattress is already waterproof so why use this.I know my baby would just sweat on this (something I was trying to avoid.Do yourself and your baby a favor and buy a wool pad or sheepskin.You will be a lot happier with it and I`m sure it`s a lot healthier."
2,Cannon 10X42 IS binoculars BIONIC EYES!,"I hesitated to spend this much on something kind of ugly, and when I first opened the box, thought I had made a mistake...until I tried them while at sea. I deep sea fish, and have always had good Zeiss binoculars onboard... but only use them in calm seas; attempts to use otherwise result in cross-eyed vertigo. The new Canon binocs are like having bionic eyes! I not only see distant birds that I never would have seen otherwise, but can actually watch my trolling baits far behind the boat and see how they are running. My Cayman friends all went bonkers when I let them try these beauties out. I am thrilled with this product and getting rid of my treasured Zeiss binocs."
2,Many Great Tracks!,"Head Music has often been regarded is Suede's weakest album; I won't go into that discussion, but simple note that the album contains some of my favourite songs by the band.I was fortunate to see them last summer in Denmark shortly before their split was announced. They played several songs from Head Music, and I particularly enjoyed ""She's in Fashion"", ""Asbestos"" and ""Down"".Other great tracks are ""Everything Will Flow"" and ""He's Gone"""
1,"Inaccurate, shallow and poorly made","This is very low quality work. Narration is full of mispronunciations and grammatical errors. The information in the documentary is not very deep, barely scraping the surface. There are inaccuracies as well. I would not recommend wasting time on this, there are too many other better sources of information out there."
1,"A few good tracks, too few.","Studio 54 is a shabby film. I've spent $7 to watch it and a friend of mine spent an extra $20 to buy the soundtrack. After I've listened to the album I felt sorry for my friend and his 20 bucks. Like the film the Album is mostly full of chaff, with only two or three tracks worth listening to. The great ""heart of glass"" is the reason why this album got two stars instead of no stars at all, ""knock on wood"" is also nice, and so is the first track. So take your hard earned $20 and buy a ""Blondie"". With the change you can go and get a ticket to a good film."
2,A David Bowie classic,words cannot describe how impacting David Bowie's performance in this film changed a generation. I recommend this movie to anyone curious of the unmatched talent that is David Bowie
2,One of Brin's best!,"This is a great book, set in the near future. David Brin paints a believable picture of what life might be like in 50 years...some things better, some worse. For those of us who love our home planet, and are concerned with it's future health, this is an invaluable book. The action takes place planet wide, with a huge cast of characters, but is so well written that it's easy to keep track of everyone and everything. And the involvement of the internet to save the earth...well, WOW! Wouldn't that be cool?!This novel will leave you with renewed hope for the future."
2,Forward-thinking pop,"JC's album is not the expected template from a boy band exile. He did not hire the biggest names to generate only surefire radio hits. But have you really listened to the radio hits lately??? Heard one, heard them all. JC took amazing chances on ""Schizophrenic"" and the risks succeed spectacularly. The lyrics may surprise -- shock is too strong for the PG-13 sentiments, but the wordplay ranges from frenetic fun to thought- and emotion-provoking. ""100 Ways"" is pure dance groove and sexual hijinks. And I love the way his more potent sexual lyrics respect his female partners. ""Build My World"" goes beyond saccharine love songs and expresses true yearning. His Basement Jaxx track, ""Shake It,"" demands you do just that. Give this album the chance it deserves or be satisfied with the fill-in-the-blank, pick-the-usual-beat offerings now monopolizing radio."
1,Terrible.,"I remember waiting months on end for the release of this album.The day it was released, I bought it. Took it home. Put it in my CD player, and it was horrible right from the start."
2,Just as Good as the Original if not Better!,"I like both versions a whole lot. Steven Weber really surprised me with his performance here and Rebecca D. was much better than that annoying Shelley Duvall from Kubrick's version. I like how Jack Torrance slowly became obsessed and crazy due to the hotel, whereas, Nicholson was going crazy from almost the start. This version also follows the book nearly perfectly, by having the ghosts more interested in Danny and his powers than just making his father a murderous psycho. I own both versions on DVD, and while the 1980 version is a horror classic, this is the version I prefer to watch to get the meaty story that Kubrick left out."
2,Absolutely Fantastic!,"If you haven't read this book--YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD! It is absolutely fantastic. It contains a superior story-line, as well as some hot romance. There are a lot of unexpected twist, and turns throughout the plot. There is more than one antagonist involved - It will definitely have you fanning toward the end to see what the reaction of the characters are, & what's going to happen next. The characters-Cameron, Marek, Tara & many more are very vivid, well formed, and carried out. You will feel the emotions of each character. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and can't wait for Karen White-Owens to add to her publishing list."
1,Do Not Waste Your Life or Money on this moronic film,I have now officially wasted $10.99+tax and about 90 minutes of my life on the stupidest piece of work to ever leave Hollywood. Do not make the same mistake I did. Please learn from my error!
1,The Original But Not their Best,Bon Jovi's self titled debut album contains nine tracks which are all right but with the exception of Runaway do not reach the musical heights of their later albums. You would purchase this album more for historical value if your fan of the greatest rock band of the 80's rather than for the actual songs on here. This album is where it all began and the tracks are not as substantial guitar wise or lyrically as the boys will achieve on their later masterpieces. Unless you are a huge Bon Jovi fan you probably will not want this album. Bon Jovi have created some of the greatest albums ever made and New Jersey and Slippery When Wet would be my recommendations if you do not own any of their albums at all and are looking to start.
1,"Bad; no, pretty bad.","Truthfully, I am surprised that this novel was published. Badly written, the writing was strained and didn't flow, and I merely finished it because it was short. Overall, the story was more akin to an episodic crime television drama, albeit perhaps worse."
2,The First Year Type 2 Diabetes: An Essential Guide for the Newly Diagnosed,"If you have been recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, this book is the only one you need to read. You don't need to be a doctor to read it; it is written in layman's language. It helped me to understand this disease and what I can expect in the future. It provides information on the importance of diet and taking care of yourself."
2,sal's review,I got this book fast! I was completely ready and i had my book just in time for the first day of school!
1,It just bites!,"This Swedish horror comedy about vampires that take over a town during what known as polar night. It is when the sun will remain down for up to 24 hours. This will of course mean the vampires have more timme to roam about town. A pill manufactured by a vampire scientist that supposed to turn humans into vampires makes it way to a local party. Thinking it's some kind of new drug the teens pass it around without a second thought. It does'nt take long before evryone begins to turn on each other. This movie gets is ridiculous at times. For one, the dogs talk in this movie. Yes they talk. They have no real purpose but to try and be funny nothing else. To make things worse the action does not pick up until the last 25 minutes or so in this film. Until then we only see shadows of killings. Overall Sweden failed attempt at a fun horror-comedy for the vampire genre. It has a bad script,editing, and video-game effects. I just can not recommend this one."
2,These will save u alot of time.,"These ""Straws"" will save u alot of time. Just slip them over the old deterior in-the-box wiring.That's the only place the start to fray. Stop it in the box befor it's too late. GREAT"
2,Onkyo TX-SR705,This receiver has many user-friendly features allowing me to connect many components to my High Definition Television via just one HDMI cable. This is what I have been waiting for the industry to come up with for about 20 years. They have finally done it!
2,"Like spending time with a dear, old friend","As a fan I'd like to thank Chris Lemmon for sharing these memories of his beloved father with all of us. Jack Lemmon was an amazing actor with an incredible range of characters he presented to us in his long career. This book gives a wonderful glimpse of the delightful (and, yes, flawed) human being behind the characters. One warning: there are numerous laugh-out-loud moments in the book and, for many, the chapter on the legends of the Hillcrest Country Club will require Depends."
2,6 Deck Card Shuffler,"I play cards weekly with 6 to 8 people and we use a deck of cards per person, playing Hand and Foot. This shuffler has saved us a lot of time by being able to shuffle six decks at once. It has worked out great, and I would recommend it to others."
2,A Fine Basic Edition,"This Dover Thrift Edition of The Life and Times of Tristram Shandy, Gentlemen, is a handsome package in terms of size, cover, and ease of reading. It's one drawback is a paucity of the sorts of introductions, timelines, explanatory notes and addenda you find in Oxford Classic or Penguin Classic versions. In fact, there's only one brief introductory note, then you're on your own. But it's a fine way to read the novel itself, and a great value even at full cover price."
1,An embarrassing hack of a book,This is nothing more than a reproduction of the MSDN andBorland help. Some of the examples are copied verbatim from MSDN andtranslated to Pascal. Do not waste your money on this book. It does not deserve shelf space in your library.
1,Not exactly a King epic:,"Bad special effects, a completely wooden plot nailed to cardboard characters, bad acting and cheesy gore effects do not compliment would could have been a very scary movie. Inexplicably incestious Cat people live like cia undercover agents in a small town, and stake out victims to gain energy. There is no explanation as to what these creatures are, and basically the whole thing is a solid vehicle for a bunch of scenes involving painfully conspicious latex prop limbs being torn and split while the creatures feed off of the energy of fresh victims (one scene where a man has his hand cut off actually rivals luke skywalker's incredibly unconvincing appendage loss in ""The Empire Strikes Back). The cat people themselves are reminiscent of japanese rubber suit monsters (one almost expects power rangers to jump out) and the morphing special effects look ridiculous. Entertaining enough to warrant watching the whole thing ... even If not for any reason it intended to be."
1,Won't Buy Another Dirt Devel,"I wrote a review on this vacuum. I made two mistakes. First mistake is I wrote a review on this model, when in fact it was a Dirt Devel Vision Turbo I purchased. The second mistake was Buying the other model Dirt Devel. Take my comments and apply them to the other model."
2,"""Must"" reading for all parents of argumentative kids.","As every parent learns, disagreements with their children are inevitable and can lead to exasperated feelings and harsh, life affecting disputations. For many years parents have been sharing with Dolores Curran responses that worked for them when their kids started arguing with them. In Tired Of Arguing With Your Kids? she shares the best and most effective of these. Arguing with kids may be inevitable, but it doesn't have to be exhausting, emotionally scarring, unproductive, or futile. Curran writes with wit, wisdom and humor, enabling the reader to find the right words, the right attitude, and the right approaches to transforming argumentation into an effective, practical, and successful parenting tool of child management, growth and development."
1,Awful!!,"This was the worst Beatles type movie ever!! There are some disturbing scenes that you better be prepared for, the whole movie is on speculation on what happen with John and Brian.............Bad just bad, and this coming from a die-hard fan of both The Beatles and John Lennon!!"
1,Unreadable,"This was not a book I could pick up and read. Although I read the intro and a study guide and was keenly anticipating reading one of the greatest books ever written, I was unable to. I read the first Combray twice and still did not understand sections I had read. I felt defeated, disappointed, and stupid. The book, for me, requires intense concentration - no distractions or noise while reading - a virtually impossible scenario in my world. After reading the synopsis in the back of the book I wasn't sure I would want to pursue this even in a study group or classroom situation. It sounded dry and boring and I'm not sure it would be worth the effort for me."
2,"Rich Man Poor Man, The complete collection","I enjoyed this series immensely, the acting and whole story was first class. Definitely would recommend it to any future buyers"
1,esta vieja no canta,esta actrizsexo servidora ni canta apesta se cree mucho porque anda con el idiota de luis miguel ademas de que el disco es horrendo se cree mucho porque lo produjo otro enjendro naquisimo ab quintanilla que es un naco de primera que se cree el muy gringo y no es mas que un mendigo pocho el cd es horrible el primer sencillo apesta aracely deberias de regresar a hacer novelas naquerrimas con otro naco que es emilio la rosa
1,Terrible,"I had to waste 4 DVDs to be able to have one of them written on correctly, a real nightmare."
2,Mother Lode for Second British Invasion,"The Yardbirds were one of those great 'first British Invasion' groups whose primary claim to later fame is the fact that they provided the breeding ground for the stars of the 'second British invasion' lead by Cream, Traffic, and others. The thing which is so easy to forget is that groups like the Yardbirds, the Spenser Davis Group, Manfred Mann, Them, and the Graham Bond Organization were such fertile breeding grounds because their stuff was darn good itself.I love it when I see contemporary commercials come up with songs from these great early bands, and listening to this album shows us just how important the Yardbirds were in their own right, not just as the launching pad for the careers of Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Paige.This is an essential album for any survey of rock roots!"
2,Astounding,"Astounding is the only word to explain this work. It is the most amazing thing I have ever read. The writing style is an art form in and of itself!At first, the footnotes are a bit disruptive. However, very quickly the reader learns that a big part of this work ARE the footnotes!Definately NOT a ""fluffy"" read! If you start this book, make sure that you have the time to commit, because you WON'T want to put it down. It's kept me up serveral nights until the ""wee hours"" of the morning, lost among it's dark hallways . . ."
2,"Solid hose, very light.","A light, managable air hose. Get it, and you'll thank yourself the next time you're on a ladder and you don't feel 20' of goodyear rubber dragging your tool down. It keeps a slight memory, so to avoid frustration one should stretch it all the way out at the beginning of use and don't turn in circles during use.The only downside is use while roofing. The smooth outer surface makes it slide off the roof deck. It's not so heavy that you can't whip the hose back up, but it gets annoying. I'll break this hose out for steep roofs where the hose will hang anyway, but for the most part, I use the Goodyear on the roof and the hitachi on the ground."
2,gathering up some blue,"Gathering Blue was a great book. At first I found it boring and stupid, but as I kept read it seemed to get more and more interesting. Some of the characters were people that you wouldn't see on a daily basis. Kira is paralyzed and has had a hard life, Matt is a dirty little boy who lives in the Fen, and Jo is a cute little girl who was born to sing. There are more people but you will have to read and find out. Kira and her friends have to work their way through troubles and lies. Kira also gets a suprise and finds out a hidden secret."
2,Who knew?,"Who knew one could actually *review* a bumper sticker? Well, as a US Marine, I found this bumper sticker to really hit home, be extremely on-the-mark, full of wit, insight, and just downright humorous. Almost Kafka-esque in its visceral charm. Get yours today."
2,Great Carb Cookbook!,"This book is wonderful! I ordered this book because my husband has had much success eating low on the glycemic index with a nationally known ""food ships to your home"" diet plan. Fearful that when the shipments stop the weight will come back, I realized I had to adjust our family meals. I learned so much in the first section on why and how to eat low on the glycemic index. So far I have created three recipes that were hits with the 7 and 9 year old and the old man himself! Best of all, the ingredients were purchased at our local discount grocer with a few things coming from our grocery chain store. No special trips to the specialty stores yet! I have already recommended this book to several others. Be sure to make notes in the margin so you will remember which meals you enjoyed most and where you made any substitutions to the recipe. I even took pictures of the feast each time!"
2,"For Bone fan's,you must have it.","This single has a remix of Thuggish Ruggish Bone that is f***in tight to death.If you are a serious bone fan that loves to get st**ed and ride around and listen to bone weed songs very loud,you goto get it!!!"
1,this desk is a peice of junk,"This desk is a nightmare ,you put it together with glue!!!,which they do not send you enough of.I bought this desk for my daughters dorm room,if it lasts a month it will be a miracle.Do yorself a favor and pass on this product,it also takes a very long time to put together."
2,It works for a few years,The other review is spot on. It works but isn't a 5 star product. The light isn't aimed properly and I don't use it either. I've had mine for 3 years and it's worn out. Now it's more like a nose hair puller. I'm going to try a different brand next time.
2,Leog Review,"Very Fun for a lot of JP3 action, though plane is small and can only hold a few people. the Dinosaur is neat and it is very fun to use this set to make movies with the lego moviemaking kit."
1,lips that know how to [sing],"Whats funny is that many people seem to argue that any negative criticism of this album will surely come from people who are not adventurous enough to accept minimalist guitar and a large helping of synthsizers and electronic sounds, but while i really like the albums that this one is compared to (kid a, ok computer, bjorks later stuff), i really dont like this album's style at all. I guess in keeping with its theme, the flaming lips decided to make these songs sound like something off of the intro or credits to a bad anime cartoon series.. thats about how awkward a lot of these songs come off to me. And yeah, the singers voice is kind of whiny too, like a lot of other people have already mentioned. Maybe their other stuff is better, but its all way too girly for me. It lacks the genuine melancholy and transcendent feeling of a lot of other electronic music you could be listening to today."
2,Unique,"Little to say about this film other than it is probably the most remarkable documentary I have seen. the fact that the filmmakers spent a decade off and on getting to know 'benjamin' means that two things happen: first, there's a complete intimacy and authenticity to the fragmentary shoots; second, the filmmakers don't go for quick sensationalism, and leave out just as much as you yourself would when telling the story of a close friend. It helps if you like 'Smoke's music, but it's not essential to be a hipster, the power of the voice comes through, and the makers use so many techniques to piece the film together, they totally avoid all the cliches of a music video or concert film, getting very close to the power of performance.A truly wonderful film."
2,11 out of 12 ain't bad at all,"As the title says, there are eleven wonderful tracks on this CD. Ones that outshine the rest are B.B. King's rendition of ""Joe Cool"" and Dave Grusin's ""History Lesson"". Also deserving of recognition are Patti Austin, who does a stellar job on the classic ""Christmas Time is Here,"" and Dave Brubeck's track entitled ""Benjamin."" It has a wonderfully Brubeck feel, complete with solid flute lead. In short, even if you don't care for the sax styling of Kenny G., buy this disc. You can always program the CD player to skip Track 7."
2,Nothing Compares,"I had forgotten how much I love these movies, and the special features make this a GREAT buy for the price. The only suggestion that I have if you only like sequential series is to get past the first movie. The first one may be strange (and not really fit into the plot line of the rest of the movies) but it only gets better after that."
2,Buy a backup copy because you'll wear out the first one!!!!,"This cd is brilliant, phenomenal and full of PASSION!!! If you like ""the blues"", or you just appreciate great talent - your library is not complete without this cd. Most cd's are good for one or two songs however, this cd will hold you spellbound from beginning to end. Each song has it's own distinctive flavor and personal story. The songs are dynamic and crisp, something to be savored. Buddy Parker is unbelievably talented. His voice will embrace and captivate you, and will hold you prisoner for hours. The only thing that can outshine Buddy's cd is catching a live performance and enjoying his warm luminous personality. If your local radio station is not playing Buddy's music CALL THEM NOW!!! Good work Buddy, welcome home!!! Maria"
2,Simple Reader's Opinion of Buried Deep,"In science fiction I look for original premise, good story, believable science (within the universe described) and interesting characters. I want to be entertained but not confused by inconsistencies. KKR does an outstanding job of entertaining me. The world she has created and its characters are consistent, sensible to that world, and unique. I have read all four books and this is one of the best. The reactions of the Disty is both unfathomable and logical--just as some human cultures are to me."
2,Much needed accessory kit for the Deluxe Easel,"Bought this along with the Deluxe easel for my daughters second birthday. Highly recommended as it contains quality products, especially the paint cans."
2,loved reading this book.....couldn't put it down,i read Hot House back in the early 90's. i was in the military at the time and had heard pete earley on the radio talking about it. one day i went to the mall and picked up a copy. once i got into it i was engrossed for hrs on end. i'd go to chowhall with it. lay in bed reading and within 24 hrs i had finished it. never before or since has a book kept me locked in like that. pardon the pun. long story short i loved this book.
1,iMusic,I did an IQ test before and after using Volume 1 and my IQ score did not change. Everything else in my life remained relatively constant.
2,Good book for learning ASP.NET 2.0 basics,"If you are new to ASP.NET or have little to no programming experience this is a good book to start with. It will teach you the basics of ASP.NET 2.0, VB (No C# here) and some basic programming constructs.There are some errors in the book, which is why I did not give it 5 stars. One example of an error is on page 310 dealing with a HyperLinkField and the DataNavigateURLFormatString; this is something that apparently changed from the beta version the book was written with and the final release. (you need to convert this to template for it to work correctly). The book also touches on web parts but the code did not work, no errors just didn't work.If you know some programming and want to get beyond the dummies I'd recommend ASP.NET 2.0 in 24 Hours by Scott Mitchell, a very good book without the smarminess that comes with the dummies titles."
2,Happy Aunt,My Aunt really liked the Howdy Doody show. She has now started a collection and is thrilled to have these videos to go along with her other memorabilia.
1,Not what i thought,"I really didn't know what i was expecting from this movie but, what i got sure wasen't it. Just a sad no budget flick"
2,Another Hit,"I really enjoy Ms Jefferies books. This book was a fast read. My biggest complaint is that the Heroine is very inflexible and abrasive. The Hero does progress beyond his need for venegence, when he realizes that he loves the heroine and doesn't want to hurt her."
1,Incorrect Product Length,"BEWARE! This product is not 11 feet long as advertised. It's actually 13.5 feet long. Look it up on the merchant's ([...]) website and see for yourself. Do a search for ""PC-14"" Hammock and you will find it.Unfortunately, I only relied on the Amazon listing, and only realized the hammock was too long when [...] sent me the confirmation email which stated it was 13.5 feet long. The really bad part is that I was out of town on an extended trip and couldn't return the item with the 30 day return period. They eventually let me return it, but they refused to refund ANY of the shipping costs, so it ended up costing me $38 to ship to Brooklyn, NY from Tucson, AZ.I feel this was completely unacceptable due to their incorrect product dimensions on Amazon. Buyer beware!!"
2,Bumbo Tray,Love the tray! Very easy to assemble and looks to be easy to clean. The tray is much stronger than I would have thought it to be. My only complaint is that it's a bit of a pain removing it from the bumbo when you are trying to get your little one out but I didn't read the instructions so take that for what it's worth.
2,Toys for tots,"I purchased this item for my 3 year old granddaughter. She loved it! & I found it to be durable, safe, colorful and ideal for her."
1,Misleading title,"When buying this book I was very interested in learning which are some key cultural differencies with moral implications and the title of this book promised to provide me such information.However I found that the real subject is the Relativistic approach versus the Ethnocentric one: which is mainly, from my point of view, a discussion between two philosophical parties without supporting the real matter."
1,Amazon Extremely Slow To Deliver,Item purchased Jan 30th 2007 and as of March 8th it still has not been shipped.
2,Great Skate Bag for College Student,"This is a great skate bag. Just remember to strap your board with the friction tape face out so it doesn't wear the pack material down (makes little fuzzy strands). Great pockets and organization. Holds my Nalgene on easy grab side pockets nice and snug. Also, It keeps my cell phone snug and my tiny digital recorder snug so they don't fly all over and break when I'm running around with my pack on. Umm... comfortable to wear! Oh yeah! Top zip compartment with fleece liner for your sunglasses to keep your shades nice and unscathed. Great pack... recommended to all!"
1,The big dust,I did not like the book at all. I hated how Billie Jo was scarred for life. Her mom died with the baby it name was franklin because her father was looking forward for his wife to have a boy but she had girl. Her father burned Billie Jo and her mother. Nonething grow in the field not the wheat or the apple. The boy Billie Jo likes is gone his name is mad dog. Her best friend gone somewere. This book I would recomme if you like book like that.
1,Filter Floats Up,"The filter that fits into the bottom of the unit keeps floating up. Basically the did not design it tight enought to fit. So now you have a boiling hot cup of water and your trying to manipulate the filter back in with spoons. No fun. I emailed them and they suggested preheating it with hot water. The filter then expand and stays. I don't want to have to add steps to compensate for their design/manufacturing mistakes.I now wedge it in tightly with a strip of tea bag (bought the roll your own tea bag assortment) That works, but again. Shouldn't happen.There is a competing product with a large, wide bowl. I would try that one instead. Another advantage, the wider bowl will allow you to load the filter more easily. I have a large hand and its hard to fit it into ingenuitieas narrow cup.On a positive note their tempored clear glass teapot is great. Tea stays Hot for 20+ minutes."
1,Don't waste your time,"In one word, BORING. The beginning is ""gripping"" but the novel reads on like an after school special."
1,Fair at best,"Just as I expected, I knew that there would be rabid fans labeling this affair with overwrought accolades. Ms. Thorn has produced much better work than this with EBTG and various guest appearances. But without the club beat-backed tracks too add some ""oomph"", this album would be one big snooze. And even the club tracks don't sizzle. There was nothing here that made me want to know what she was singing about. I just didn't care.Brilliant? Umm, I don't think so."
2,great read,This is a great starter book for anybody starting off in the craft. For covens or solitary this book gives facts and understanding about the religon as well as ritiuals for sabbats and some basic spells. I was recomended this book and I have continued to recomend it to others.
2,Too Funny!,"Elf is one of the most ""quoted"" movies at our house. Funny for the whole family. Be in the holiday spirit ..not in a serious state of mind and you will enjoy it!"
2,HUGE FUN!!,This thing is HUGE and so much fun! VERY DURABLE! Easier to land than the microfly.....my husband loves it!
2,One of the best football books I have ever read.,A great story of a true american hero. I loved the book and felt that Jeff Hostetler told a wonderful story of growing up and dealing with lots of problems and never ever giving up. I was so glad that he won the Super Bowl in 1991 with the New York Giants but even happier that his Mom could be there to watch him before she passed away. Jeff is an example to young people everywhere about following your dreams and never letting people tell you you are not good enough. He is a true inspiration..( even if he did put red-hot in Phil Simms underwear!!) I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.
2,Tasty but out of date...,Very tasty. I began to use them in baking cookies for xmas time but noticed they had sent an expired bag. Amazon refunded me right away but never was able to get a current bag.
2,He Loved Words,"As one who seeks intelligence in film, I enjoyed hitting the long ball in selecting this work. It is the prize of scholarship sought and sometimes won by education, all unabashedly depicted in original, colorful and somewhat funky, creative lines. Very British, the story examines education and coming of age in the world of intellectual and academic pursuit.Whereas, short of Dead Poet's Society, the Hollywood examination of school life is shallow and crass; this film, without neglecting the efficacy of humor, pierces silly bantering and successfully reveals the conflict and eventual realization that sometimes comes with change or graduation.I'll watch this again, and I highly recommend it to others."
1,Not Amused,I tried to sit through the movie on BOOTLEG because it definitely didn't look good enough to rent. I was right. I was bored pretty much through it. I got to Vince Vaughn getting knocked down by the steroid football player and gave up. I wasn't entertained. How many weddings can you crash to make an hour and a half's worth of a movie without realizing the idea is old?
2,Not as good as the others,"I thought this one dragged a bit, but I still like Mary Logue's writing and the characters."
1,but did you really learn anything?,"For my money, this book merely restates the obvious and begs the essential questions. Nobody serious about his golf needs to be told the stuff in this book. Those who are not serious will be ahead after being told nearly anything. There is a vast industry devoted to helping people improve their golf scores from 103 to 97. Typically, the inprovement results from reducing the number of scalded wedge shots and four putt greens. I would like to know how many reviewers after reading this book went out and hit the golf ball solidly and dead straight? I would guess that more went out and clogged up the course with an endless preshot routine."
1,Not as fresh as expected,I was quite disappointed in the lack of freshness of the Bilberry Tea. It has a stale flavor that I've not encountered in other Bilberry Teas.
2,"yes sir, thats my baby!","the winner of this years oscar for foreign language film, i expected to dislike this as a piece of liberal claptrap. but its not; its a sensitive portrayal of people whose lives have been torn asunder by circumstance (based on the only novel by famed south african playwright athol fugard), and a young thug redeemed (at least to some extent) by accident. a terrific score only serves to further establish a mood of desperation mixed with inklings of hope. a minor masterpiece, and be sure to watch director gavin hoods earlier moving short ""the shopkeeper"", included as an extra on the dvd."
1,How the Mighty are Fallen,"Beat out for the Director's Guild Award today by Byambasuren Davaa and Luigi Falorni's ""The Story of the Weeping Camel"". Ain't that too bad."
1,Groundforce Disaster - lousy customer service,"I buy the Groundforce Electric Go Kart and less than 1 hour out of the box the rear axle breaks!! Unbelievable. So I call customer service. They request I fax in my UPC/proof of purchase and they will send me a new axle. Instead, they (somebody named Phil) send me two rear wheels. I call again, talk to another service rep., re-fax my documentation and after a week-and you're not going to believe this-they send me an electrical kit for for one of their scooters. So I call again. This time they are not receiving any audio on their customer service lines so I'm shouting into the phone (three times I tried) and they hang up on me after 10 seconds or so...each time! Avoid these guys like the plague. They are the worst company I have ever done or at least tried to do business with...they do not deserve your business."
2,excellent,thanks for sale I look forward to buying them a hug soon and Merry Christmas and prosperous New Year 2013
1,Don't waste your time with this,I felt like I was sitting back in my kindergarten class with this one. Felt really demeaned. Not fun or even interesting.
1,All the songs sound the same,Every song on this CD sounds alike to me. The songs aren't bad - they're just kinda boring. I can't remember how they go once they're over.
1,Best album of all time,"This album is the g.o.a.t it is 50 000 000 times better than illmatic, life after death, its dark and hell is hot, and all eyez on me which i thought had weak rymes and ... beats. catch this, the best line in hip-hop its getting hot in here/so take of all your cloths. the lovey pop-rap songs are just great. 6 stars."
2,Great Movie,"I like the novela and the movie, waiting to see the next movies with ROnie Mara and Daniel GraigGreat"
1,i didn't received the 3 gallon i got the 2 1/2 gallon,"the 2 1/2 gallon i received instead of the 3 gallon splatter that i couldn't use the fountain no more than an hour. there was too much splatter. the second time i used it the fountain wouldn't drain properly as if it was clogged, but it wasn't and it splatter evern more the second time. it splatter so much that i could feel the drink splatter on me when i approach the fountain to tried to fix it. i wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
2,Great combination,Very interesting and enjoyable combination of instruments and selections. Looking forward to further collaborations from this duo.
2,I'm glad I bought it; reminds me: my feelings = my experience.,"Okay, parts are kind of dorky, things we already know ... but many good ideas on how to apply just simple things, like if you want a new job; get your wardrobe ready as if you are starting the next day, etc. Change your thinking, change your life. If you are cynical or negative don't buy this book ... it's for us positive, optimists. Oh yea."
1,wrong region,"Hi there,I would like to purchase this DVD but it is NTSC not PAL, or it'sRegion 1 not Region 4. Any ideas? Was a CD produced?RegardsMegan TudorDown-under"
1,Drugs are the downfall of society !!!!!!!!!!,"David Icke should consider writing comedy [""Reptilian Aliens from the 4th dimension taking over earth (HaHaHaHa)""]. In the first couple of chapters in skimming through Icke's book its apparent that icke is just another washed up soccer player who vents his frustration against the government. Likewise, Icke's anger and insanity doesnt stop here. He invents this whole story of travelling to brazil in order to take this mystical herb and magically he becomes aware of different planes of existence. Unfortunately, he's able to draw simple analogies to his experience from modern day quackery hollywood movies such as 'The Matrix'. The funny thing with people like Icke is their ability produce luaghable theories that aren't applicable in real life. For example: If Icke seriously believes that 'life' is just an 'illusion' why doesnt he kill himself ? Nevertheless, such loonies as Icke will never be taken serious by real researchers !!!!!!!!!!!"
2,MINE WORKS JUST GREAT!,"My son got this for Christmas and I think it works just great. Anyone having a problem with it walking is either doing something wrong or there is something wrong with the toy itself. It is NOT going to walk on heavy carpet, plain and simple. But it will walk on flat carpet and it walks and runs just great, turns right or left and even backs up well on flooring.Does it have true AI? Of course not...it's a $100 toy. What were you possibly thinking. It is a remote controlled robotic dinosaur and nothing more. It does have a guard mode that it can detect movement and move it's head and roar if something crosses it's vision which is actually pretty cool. The roaming feature that allows the dinobot to move freely about and turn away from objects also works quite well.If you're expecting this guy to fetch you your slippers and morning paper then get a dog and train it. This is a toy, and a pretty cool toy at that and should be taken for nothing more advanced.Reviewed by Tim Janson"
2,Fanstastic action packed DVD for the superheroes and my daughters,"Wasn't sure if my daughters would be into a super heroes movie, but VeggieTales hit this one out of the park! They are 8, 5.5 and 2 and all love it! It is much more action-packed that even Larry Boy movies with lots of louder music and car chases, action, but my girls LOVED it until they broke it on a car trip! Just bought two copies for boy birthday parties coming up and my girls are begging for a replacement copy. Perfect to go along side or instead of the Avengers and other violent superheroes movies out there...this one is light hearted and FUN! Thank you VeggieTales!"
1,Bad watch,Watch stops at some o'clock every week. Also for a month of use some times showed incorrect date. It is necessary to return to the manufacturer.
1,"poor research, poor facts","The biases in this book are obvious. I wonder if the writer has ever set foot in a Mormon church, and sat through all three hours of meetings and services. He claims to know about the Mormon church, but has he investigated the original sources. Does he claim to have been in a Mormon temple? No, most of his ""facts"" are hearsay and rumors. If the writer has a point to make about religion, please tell me your beliefs; tell me why your beliefs are correct. Attacking others does nothing to inform people about the correctness of your beliefs."
1,"strange definition of ""diameter""","Look up diameter in the dictionary, it says the _straight line_ distance across a circular object. This umbrella is only 48"" if you measure along the rounded outer edge while open. Look at reviews for other GB umbrellas and you'll see people reporting them as smaller than described. This one is only around 37"" diameter. I called the company about this and spoke to a man who identified himself as the company president (1-888-(487-8287)) - he was rude, interrupted me constantly, and wouldn't let me even finish a sentence. First he said that that was the standard definition and then he told me that he didn't believe me when I quoted his own website. He did say he would get the website description changed, but that doesn't make selling me an umbrella smaller than described OKat this point, I'm not going to buy another GB umbrella just because I don't want to give money to a company who thinks it's OK to treat a customer the way I was treated on the phone"
2,I miss Third Watch,"this was one of my favorite shows... a great show following NYPD and FDNY. (IMO, the police are the best part of the show). Better than any other cop show if you ask me (besides COPS)... I hope upon hope they put the remaining 5 seasons on DVD as well with even more great extras!!"
2,Received broken and then company had no more,My complaint is more about the company than the product(we have this piano and is is beautiful and perfectly made). I ordered the piano as a gift and it arrived with a broken leg. The recipient called the company for a replacement and was told to await a new piano. Weeks later I received an email stating this company was out of the product and issued a credit.
2,Fast and entertaining,"The Summons draws me in. I feel the excitement as if I am the novel's hero. I feel his fear. The suspense keeps the pages turning, like the book is underneath a high-speed overhead fan during a Mississippi summer. The characters hold my interest. I hope that the hero will be successful, but I never really know if he will be.Roger Weston, author ofThe Assassin's Wife"
1,The author misquotes like almost every other Mormon author.,I read this book and found it to be laking any credibility! Th author had no shame in misquoting Ed Decker and others involved in the book The God Makers. A lot of circular reasoning was used and the old Morman trick of fabricating bizarre facts and reasons for supporting Mormonism is easily seen in his book. Modern day mormans need to be honext with themselves and read Morminism's Shadow or Reality. If one fact can be shown to be untrue then I challenge them to do so...it can't because any honest seeker of the truth who studies the history of Mormonism will come out of it thanking God for their deliverence from this cult.
1,Don't waste your time,This DVD is a total waste of time. It shows her going to a garage sale buying only stuff with name brands or markings and then hoping what she bought will sell on ebay. common sense stuff! Don't bother.
2,How to Make Sewing Patterns: a Review,"This is a wonderful book for the home patern designer who is looking for a basic, simple, easy to use method for pattern designing of clothing. I found that when I did the patterns there were now hard to interpret tables, just easy and straight forward measurements to take and then follow. There were really now major drawbacks to this method. But at times it's simplicity can be a bit tedious to someone who has done pattern designing and tries to skip steps or not follow the instuctions closely. Other then that. This book is by far the best i have used and tried in my quest for the perfect pattern designs of basic pattens. I give thumbs up to the author, Donald H. McCunn. Well done!May 6, 2000"
2,Funny Gag Gift,The Pull My Finger Farting Santa is a great gag gift to give to a coworker or family member. It gives everyone a good laugh.
1,Didn't like it at all,Very big for my head ant the material doesn't like me at all seems like rubber from a car neumatic
2,Amazing piece of kitchen equipment!,"Wonderful slicer! I'm so glad I bought one, and wish I had gotten one sooner! I love having fresh veggies, and it really makes it easy to cut them up! Highly recommended! And you can't beat the price!"
1,Wheww! What stinks?,"A good story that's poorly written: You can skim the first three quarters where he tells you everything 2-3x. Is there a test at the end? Richard Preston, please rewrite"
2,CroCop/Silva,"This DVD has some extremely exciting fights... the biggest being the main event. Once again, this is a moment in MMA history that is not only worth seeing, but worth having in your collection. This fight not only looks great on paper, but delivers in spades. The staredown between these two truly sets the stage for the epic battle. It truly is a must own for this fight alone... but like I already said, there are several other phenomenal fights on the card as well.Highly recommended!"
1,So disappointing,"The action and effects were great, but the Matrix presumes to be something deeper. It turns out that it's just confusing mush.There's a lot of talk about choice and purpose and love--and if this trilogy is to mean something it ought to say something. And you think it's going to. But it doesn't. Smith asks Neo why he gets up, why he continues to fight. Neo just says, ""Because I choose to."" Ridiculous. Is that all the Wachowskis want to say? After all the interaction of choice, destiny and love, Neo ends up a pure existentialist? Again, I say, ridiculous.And to top it off, Neo's ""choice"" results in peace with the machines. Peace! Are you kidding? After the wonderfully rich set up of the machines as symbolic of the way our own pride, ambition and hubris can blind and enslave us, the result is peace with the enslaver? Huh?They should have stopped with just the first one. They got completely lost with the next two."
1,AVOID--Does not work,I have used this product 6 times--and 5 times I have opened the washer to find my bra tangled up with everything else. I recommend against it.
2,Great motivator! Outstanding product! A++,"Wow! I just finished my second 5k daily run with the Nike + iPod Sports Kit and now I can't imagine running without it ever again! It's so simple to use and provides so much information both during AND after each run. The Nike website that's linked to my iTunes program whenever I synch my iPod Nano is outstanding. It allows you to set personal goals, track your progress, and even to get your friends involved in a running contest. The Sports Kit could not have been easier to set up and yes, it does work with non-Nike+ shoes. I just stuck a small piece of velcro on the tracking device and sewed the other part onto the tongue of my running shoes under my shoe laces and it works perfectly. It is worth every penny and once you get it, you'll soon discover the many benefits of keeping track of your mileage, average time per mile/kilometer, and distance left to meet your goal for the run. Great job, Nike and Apple!"
1,JUNK!! (If using for fresh walnuts),This broke on my first walnut and it pinched my finger to boot!! I returned it for a refund.
2,Great Primer,If you have no knowledge of semiconductors and you want to learn this is THE book. Currently I am using it for my undergraduate course in semiconductor devices and its explanations and presentation of material is wonderful.I really enjoyed the introductory chapter and supplement on quantum mechanics. It goes through just enough of the shroedinger equation so that you will have a feel for what is going on.
2,Panasonic KX-TG5422M 5.8 GHz DSS Cordless Phone with Dual Handsets,"Good clarity, looks, and battery life. However the reach from the base is not that great, I had a previous Panasonic 2.4 mhz, and the reach was almost 100% better."
1,Not worth it,"Definitely not worth watching if you are looking for the best Price Is Right. Just old stuff from the seventies. Where is Bob, Janice, Dian, Holly, and Johnnie? Definitely NOT the best Of The Price Is Right."
1,Not suited for extremely hot weather,"After 6 months when I bought this CIPA 34000 11.75"" Panoramic Rearview Clip-On the plastic frame melted at almost 100F temperature.[...]"
1,Disappointed,"I was truly disappointed with this book. I read this book for my book club, along with On the Down Low, and I must say that my expectations were not met. She addressed some things J.L. King spoke about in his book, but not enough. Ms. Browder went into long tirades about faith and conversion (not sure I agree) and other things except how to help women who have lived with or currently live with men on the down low. She never explained how she helped her children get through it and it seems like she, at times, defended her ex-husband's behavior. I'm not sure who Mrs. Browder is helping to survive, herself or other women."
1,"Technically Excellent, But A Sterile And Boring Performance","Get this release if you want to see a bloated Don Henley sing and not play the drums that often.Buy it if you don't like Don Felder and want to hear his clone Steuart Smith!Don't purchase this if you prefer Randy Meisner on bass and his excellent vocal on ""Take It To The Limit"".Otherwise, buy their all of their albums or greatest hits. No offense to Joe Walsh, but this reminds me of an extremely polished and professional oldies act on PBS."
1,Total Ripoff !,"This is a total rip-off. What the listing doesn't tell you is that you only get 4 tea bags !! I spent $6 for the box of tea and another $8 for shipping. So, basically, I spent $14 for 4 tea bags!"
2,You can practice as much as you want!,"I thought this book was very helpful, it enabled me to breakdown questions I had no idea of the answer and answer them correctly! I thought at first you could only take the test twice, so I called Kaplan's hotline and was told to key in any arrangement of 10 #'s. Super,super book! The breakdown at the end of the test is so helpful and the book is easy to read and learn from. Kaplan also has a website. Good Luck!"
2,Great Chick Flick,A great movie if you just want a good chick flick. Ya I couldn't help but enjoy this movie. Even tough I don't watch too many movies like this I have really enjoy this one. Very dramatic and good acting.
1,DON'T BUY!!,"I wished I would have read all reviews posted before!! this device didn't work from the first try, and I thought the quality of the audio cables I was using was not good enough, so I ordered a new one, but surprise, it didn't work! so please DON'T BUY IT, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY."
1,Short lifespan,"Okay, so you just can't help getting coffee on the counter with all that static. That didn't bother me too much over the course a full ten months and one week of its decent performance. The little button you turn it on with collapsed inside and you can't get into the unit to put it back. It's still under warranty, so I can drive to and from the nearest service center...just less than 65 miles (2 times). There are all of four authorized service centers in California! Wow, that is service! Or I can box it up, take it to the post office, pay to mail it, wait a year or two and hope I see it again. But...I guess I have to buy another grinder if I want coffee before spring. Save your money for something with a five star review.I want to add that I had purchase one of these for a friend, and her's didn't even last as long as mine."
2,Fantastic!,"If you love classic Doctor Who, and the Daleks then this is your kind of story. The story writing is strong with several overtures of apocalyptic war. This is a marvoulus tell of the Kaled war with the Thall. This DVD also includes tons of special features of how this story was made and a history of the Daleks!"
2,Happy with this book!,"Passed the CLEP on 8/2/06 with a 75! This book does NOT cover everything you'll find on the exam. It DOES condense into less than 100 easy to read pages enough info to pass the exam. (I had the same experience with REA's CLEP for biology-there was a lot on the CLEP exam the REA book didn't cover, but I still scored a 65 by really knowing the content of the book.)I wasn't confident about my psych knowledge so I also used collegeboard.com and instacert for the CLEP Intro to Psych. These sites helped me score higher, but I still found questions on the CLEP that also were not found in these sources.My advice--be thorough with your study of the REA book--and pass the CLEP!"
2,"Not perfect, but one of the best available","Ok, so it's a low budget film and some folks feel the plot could have been developed better. Even so, it's an unflinching adaptation of the novel by Jane Rule and a better film than many others with bigger budgets that get much more exposure. Besides, it's simply a pleasure to watch. After seeing ""The Color Purple"" and ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" I could only hope that the films were enough to lead viewers to get the books on which they were based and read the real stories. After watching ""Desert Hearts"" I felt the ""real story"" of the novel had been told, though I still strongly recommend the book. Kudos to Donna Deitch for working so hard to bring this to us. I'm replacing my worn home copy of a broadcast I recorded years ago with an ""official"" copy as a Christmas gift to myself."
1,Accidentlly picked the wrong DVD,"I accidentally chose this DVD over the classic. This is a video book, literally someone reading the book to you while the video pages are being turned. Don't buy this unless you want to use it for educational purposes."
1,Human Centipede HD,Slow and boring. The plot made no sense and went nowhere fast. The end could not have come any faster.
2,Very Helpful Book,The book is very easy to understand and follow the exercises. Prefect for any type of user from beginner to expert. Must have if plan to take a GIS course or get certified in GIS.
1,Don't bother with this speaker,"I read the reviews and should have known better. I followed the directions in the manual exactly, plugged in the speaker and for about 4 seconds they worked. After that - nothing. I called the 800 number and was on hold for 26 minutes. The ""technician"" who answered the phone basically read the manual to me and asked me if the power light was glowing, and if so what color. Then the response from the technician was ""sounds like you have a problem"" - hello??? Why do they think I called! This is going back. From now on I will trust the reviews!"
1,TopCell not as good as original.,The TopCell replacement battery for Makita 7.2 volt is not as good as the original. AH is too low making run time too short and not enough power.
2,Decent Pair of Gloves!,"While these aren't the best pair of bag gloves you can buy, they are what you should expect for the price. Also, the description says that they're lightweight bag gloves, this means they should be used with focus mitts, speed bags, or lighter heavy bags. They could be used for mixed martial arts as well; however, they're a little stiff in the fingers for that. I used them with hand wraps and they worked well."
1,Torn within 5 minutes,"My daughter bought this with her own money. We brought it home, filled it up and it was torn within the first 2 tosses. It tore just a little at the edge, but it was just enough to let the air leak out. I contacted the company and got no response. She loved it and was upset when it ripped. Don't waste your money."
1,CHAIR,"IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK! AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS USE AS A EXTRA GUEST BED IT SAGS IN THE MIDDLE, WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER ONE"
2,"Alux is a geat group, but this wasn't their best CD","I am from Guatemala, and all my life I heard Alux, I think this is the greatest group of Central America, if you are interested in Alux I recommend you to try to find ""Leyenda I"" and ""Leyenda II"" CDs, so you can know what Alux really is. I though this CD is good but not as the other mentioned. I hope people from other countries hear Alux, so they will kwow that here in Guatemala, exists good music."
2,Prostitution in a gritty format.,"Ms. Russell does a fantastic job in this movie. She is a beatiful street-walker, has pimp problems, acts so believable that it's hard to watch at times. What a great actress!Oh, did I see a one-star review copied three times in order to lower the general rating of this film?Well, just watch it and let your daughter watch it too! You may change your views on prostitution and realize that society should drop the morality issue and replace it by a human one. Perhaps then we will show some maturity to the rest of the world."
2,The healthcare industry is based around profits.,His explanation in this book helped answer many of my questions. He has found out what kills us and what we can do to help prevent it. Great book!
2,Amazing!,"This movie was amazing! So funny, sweet, relateable ect... Just and all around amazing movie. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,'Til worms are crawling up your ****** foam rubber a**...,"One of Robins best played Characters..He's a natural in this role, lol.Psychotic, Crazy, absolutely Hilarious Classic one-liners! ~ Couldn't breathe with over laughter in some parts. A definite must see for any Robin or Edward fan. Only one tinsie winsy negative... about Edward Nortons final stages of this film... but I don't want to ruin it for anyone :-D A lot of ppl avoid watching this film.. believing it is a kids film.. lol.. it isn't."

1,"Dangerous, My 6 Month Old Tipped Over in It","I strongly would recommend you to look for something else for you child. My son is 6 months old and was reaching forward to get a toy and the rocker tipped over and my son landed on his face. Luckily he was okay after holding him, he was mostly scared. This product should be recalled off the shelves."
1,Not worth the wait,"Absolutely horrible! I'm almost speechless. To think they spent three years putting the album together and their fans waited for *this*. It's mediocre at best, nothing groundbreaking, but wait, they never were groundbreaking. Chris Martin's voice is just whiny and all-around bad. ""Fix You"" is the album's only redemming song, but the rest of the tracks are the same stuff you can hear from a million other bands out there on the radio today. ""Low"" sounds like a cheesey 80's dance track.God, this used to be a good band. Maybe they already composed all the good music they're capable of..."
2,GREAT blade!,"I am a GC so I'm always on the look-out for great deals of stuff we use/consume a lot. This 40T blade is a great value and is a winner, no regrets!"
2,phenomenal story,"I read this book when I was a sophomore in HS. I really didn't know much about it before I read it. I thought it was just another, one of those books. I was wrong. From beginning to end, this book keeps you fully engulfed and practically glued to it. You will cry, you'll see angry but you will most importantly be educated. Buy the book. It is amazingly life changing and inspiring."
1,Netgear GS724T ProSafe 24-Port GbE Switch - trash,"This is trash, like a lot of Netgear products. I wasted an incredible amount of time trying to access this switch and gave up. Unfortunately, you can't find out the problems with this switch unless you read Netgear's own forums, AFTER you register the product. There are lots and lots of folks on Netgear's ""support"" forums who have the same issue, along with similar and related issues.You're better off buying something else, like a Cisco/Linksys switch. At least they have a QC department (because if Netgear did have a Quality Control department, this switch never would have left the plant)."
1,Terrible,"Barely pulled anything out of the air - maybe a 1/4 cup in an hour. By comparison, the LG we had running during the same time was completely full. Would not buy this brand ever again."
2,Thanks !,"Thank you very much , all was perfect and very fast ! Many thanks !I would have prefere to get this book in french , my english is not very goodbut anyway , it will be a good exercise for me ! Have a good day !"
2,Great product,This is a great product. It is a natural sweetener so you don't have to worry about it being chemically altered like the other sugar alternatives are. It is sweet and not bitter and there are plenty of packets to last a long time.
2,My students love this book!,"This book is always a favorite read-aloud for my third grade class. I read the ""balloon"" comments really quickly, and my students laugh out loud! The book lends itself for teaching comprehension skills such as cause and effect and problem/solution. I had to order a new one because my old one was worn out!"
2,"Love, love , love it!","I'm soo grateful to find this product! I drive a lot & people depend on me, but due to medical circumstances, I have found it increasingly difficult to get OUT of the car by myself WITHOUT help! Friends have followed me home to help and some have made a separate trip to my house to help AFTER my frantic telephone call!This handle provides a SAFE and sturdy thing (hamdle) to help boost me through those perilous unsteady inches when I'm trying to stand/stabilize!! It gives me confidence & stability!! I now feel safe & independent again!I hope the ads/advertizing on this product are expanded/increased! Therapists & rehabs should be giving demos on this when teaching people and evaluating SAFE exits from cars. It will save the backs of friends/families or caregivers. Perhaps they already know & I WAS IN THE DARK!"
2,Best CD Ever!,i think Greg Raposo's CD is the best CD ever! it ROCKS! GO GREG!CANT WAIT TILL UR 2ND CD LOL!
1,The One Sided Story,"If you are a right-wing, ultra conservative member of the Christian Coalition then you will love this book.According to DeLoach the FBI has never done anything wrong, Hoover never kept any secret files, and the sexual innuendos surrounding Hoover were unfounded. This may all be true as I am sure that the tales we hear of Hoover are exaggerated in order to generate interest in the man but it is other comments throughout the book that strike me as proof that the FBI can't and shouldn't police itself.DeLoach discredits anyone who suggests that Hoover was gay but yet uses the same type of proof when detailing Martin Luther King's sexual escapades (why was the FBI investigating and wire-tapping is the better question?), that students in the 60's were wrong in their protest of the US Gov't because it could lead to communism or that homosexualtiy is thrust upon us by the media. He believes in the American way so long as its his American way."
2,APC UPS,"The APC BR80-0 that I bought is a wonderful purchase that was a great selection. The software that runs monitoring the backup is easy to understand And will power down the PC if buttery levels are low, so safety ceases to be a concern"
2,Listen Carefully,"I heartily recommend this book to anyone who is a teacher, has a teacher, or knows a teacher. The author's experiences in teaching kids to write about difficult topics are described here in a warm and clear voice that serves as an illustration of how best to communicate with the kids in question. This is a very valuable tool, with specific examples and exercises which will be immediately applicable. While dealing with the stated subject, the book goes far beyond, and will be welcome reading for anyone who wants to be a better teacher of any subject, with (or because of) the added benefit of knowing themselves better through the self-examination this teaching and learning process requires."
2,Works just great!,"I bought two of these gems last week to use in a new Palm T|X. I've downloaded music files from iTunes/Mac, and the SD card works as good as any card I've seen. Tempted to get a couple more at the ""bulk"" rate."
1,Mechanism broke in about a year.,"I had a similar experience to the previous reviewer. First the mechanism started requiring more force (I later realized that one of the plastic pins had broken off) and then it failed altogether (the other pin broke off). It lasted about a year, but I expected more from it."
1,Not so good,"These envelopes are of good quality, but do not seal well, you will need to tape the flap down for security."
1,"Dirk Pitt + story idea == same song, second verse","Typical Dirk Pitt book, follows the formula, provides action and technical commentary. Nothing special within that universe, nothing special outside it. Read it while on a backpacking trip when I ran out of my primary reading material, discarded portions as I went -- don't miss having the copy of the book."
2,NO RESPECT A 'TALL,"i enjoyed the reviews of 'beany and cecil'; many details i had forgotten.. one thing i recalled, and did not see in these comments was beany's boat ?? oh, the cruelty! the callousness! the name.. the LEAKIN' LENA!"
1,Montanan says.....What happened?,"Give Anita Shreve some credit. She hooks you into what appears to be a well-written, well-paced novel about a woman grieving the loss of her husband, a pilot killed when his airliner crashes. But pretty quickly the questions crop up: Why do the airline people take over her house? Why does she let them tell her what to do? Why is she such a whimp? Sadly, despite some nice plot twists, the novel loses momentum and credibility. In the end, (finally relieved that this book is coming to an end) when you read the last sentence, you ask yourself...what happened? Lots of potential here, but sadly under-utilized."
1,"Could have been great, but...","I have to agree completely with another reviewer who rated this. In spite of the fact that there are some great old favourites here, the company that repackaged these chose to put its large, blue logo in the bottom right of the corner and leave it there throughout the entire playing of these commercials. So obtrusive is it that at times it actually blocks out key words or parts of the commercial. Whoever the brains was behind this decision should find work elsewhere. Media is clearly not your forte.This video ranks among the long list of compilation packages that ""could have been."" Unfortunately, it never actually ""is""..."
1,fair-not great,"I was a bit disappointed in this book as it is just a repeat of so many of her other books. I guess if this is the first book by her you read it is ok, but I have still read much better. Borrow it and read someone else's--or just skip it altogether."
2,Great original music from a very talented new artist,"If you like JT, Robbie Fulks, Bruce Cockburn and the like, you will really enjoy the music Mr. Weigel has made made on this CD. The songs themselves are each individual gems that span the musical range of fast and rockin' (Apple Town), to uplifitng (Jubilee), to just plain silly (Silly Girl). Mr. Weigel shows great skill at creating wonderful listening tunes that carry such richly woven lyrics that they both haunt and inspire, make you laugh while bringing a lump to your throat. The humanity that Mr. Weigel brings to his art is wonderful; I look forward to the next CD release. Truly a great purchase--I have two: one that lives in my car and one that spins on my home CD player. (I have gotten strange looks at stoplights singing along to Apple Town at the top of my lungs--guess I should have rolled up the windows...no such critical audience at home.)"
1,Shoddy,"Worked great for about a week. After one song was recorded, the mic input was the only thing still working. Another week passed and I had to re-record vocals 4-5 times to get 1-2 minutes of recording that wasn't filled with static. He headphone jack would cut in and out frequently, and it caused sound card problems in my computer. I suppose you get what you pay for, and I have learned my lesson.Side note: The program that comes with this is terrible as well. Audacity is far superior, and free."
1,flimsy,"I'm 33. This game is made like crap compared to what I had in the 80s. Why is it so small? I had to assemble the game myself. It's made of extremely light plastic. The bottom is even a poor excuse for cardboard. Its more like a heavy weight paper. I tried to sell it at a consignment shop, and the store didn't even want it. It ended up at the dump and I bought a vintage version off ebay."
1,Do not waste your money.,Driver problems with this item as others have posted. Will not hold signal from router 80' away.No updated driver available.
2,An excellent first EP from Amina,"I just saw Amina open for Sigur Ros last night in St. Louis, and I do have to say that I was totally blown away by their performance. These four women have been long time contributors to Sigur Ros, and indeed, if you do enjoy the music of Sigur Ros, you most certainly will enjoy this album. All of the four songs on this EP are hauntingly beautiful with sounds from strings, harp, xylophone, and an electronic mix. I am interested in what this group might sound like with vocals, and so I have given a rating of four stars. The music is wonderful, and I expect this group to grow and develop in great ways. Just know that if you purchase this CD, there are differences from Sigur Ros: no vocals, and a more feminine/lighter sound to the music. Again, Amina impressed me greatly enough that I went ahead and bought this EP after their performance. Hopefully there will be a full length CD coming out soon."
1,Much better alternatives,"This dictionary might seem fine if its the only Kanji dictionary you've seen. It's a total pass in my opinion.Only the first 6 grades are covered. If you don't know what your materials require, you'll likely not find plenty of characters.Key meanings of Kanji are done poorly. Too many meanings that seem unrelated. The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary picks one or two key meanings in RED color and shows how they are related.No SKIP method to lookup Kanji."
2,Christmas Music Cassette loved it,"nice cassette for listening too. I enjoy Christmas music, this cassette was easy listening too. Everyone seemed to really enjoy it"
1,Don't bother,"This album was released shortly before Iced Earth moved to a new record label. This is, essentially, just one last cash in attempt by their older label. Not much of the track listing makes sense (like putting the song Damien on the disc titled The Blessed), but they did put most of the bands best songs on here. You would be much better off buying the three disc live album Alive in Athens, of Days of Purgatory."
2,Old Faithful!!,"I've had several different types (Florida, Boston, Arizona) of Birkenstock/Betula (even a wilder pair I bought in Germany) but I haven't bought a pair in a long time. I couldn't resist such a great price. I LOVE them and wear them every chance I get. I think these are my favorite style so far (a little more dressy maybe/stands out from the copycats). Within a day or 2, they seemed to shape to my foot. No rubbing at all."
1,Don't bother,Let's see... It takes 10 minutes to clean before using it. Another 10 minutes to clean after using it. The child refuses to turn plastic crank for 5-6 minutes. Very flimsy product. Save your time and money and drive to McDonald's. If you want to make ice cream buy a real ice cream maker.
2,"Beautiful, high quality","These sheets & pillow cases are far more beautiful than I expected. The quality is excellent. I use standard-size pillows, so I'm pleased this size is included with the set of queen-sized sheets. At $39.99, this was an incredible Deal of the Day!C Goodman, Valencia CA"
2,Best shaving gel ever!,"I have not been able to find a shaving gel more compatible with my skin than Gillete's Complete Skincare Multiglide gel. As one who vastly prefers showers to baths, I found the multiglide feature to be accurate and very much to my liking. It's a pity that I'm having trouble finding it in stores now. It isn't just for men."
2,It's for everyone,"I believe God's message should be translated to any language in a simplest,most currant and direct words so that everybody can read and understand easily what God tells us. The author did a quite good job and it makes me want to read and understand more and I recommend this translation of the Quran to anyone as a must have book who is wondering about the final testament of our God for all the people of the world.In my opinion it is the best English translation of the holy Quran for every age group of people."
1,Prevent what?,"I used to enjoy Prevention magazine and when the local high school sold magazines to raise money I selected Prevention. I don't know how they can call this Prevention, when half of the magazine is ads for prescription medications! Not very preventative in my book and HIGHLY irritating!"
2,So far so good,The first battery we had only lasted about a year (but my wife uses it constantly). Noticed immediate improvement in vacuum after replacing the battery. Just wish they were a little cheaper!!
1,Why are people so ignorant?,"The picture on the cover and being introduced by Wayne Dyer on PBS convinced me this would be a good book to read so I purchased it. Only to realize that I have known this all along, and nothing really surprising about Virus of the Mind. The only thing I learned was the word ""meme.""For someone like me, English is my third language. I realize how narrow people's perceptions are if English is your only language. It makes the people prime breeding ground for virus of the mind. If you learn a foreign language or even live in another country for a while, you will see the spreading of the virus through commercials, political ads, and even your friends.To truly understand Brodie's book, I challenge those young or able enough to travel abroad and live there for at least several months. You will really come back and understand the insidious viruses here at home and the viruses abroad. It will open your eyes."
2,The technique the author used was intriguing and suspenseful,"This novel was very well written and kept me at the edge of my seat for the entire novel. The way the author uses different techniques just leaves you in awe, and wanting more. The storyline is incredibly original and unique. The classic good verse bad mottefe was given a shock and rude awakening. Peter Foster comes home to a dead corpse in which the identity is unknown. Chief inspector Neil Paget and his partner Sgt. John Tregallas are assigned to help unravel this mystery. After some fine police work they come upon the murderer. I would recomend this book to everyone and for a mature age group specifically."
1,Don't bother,"Marxist and post-modernistic verbiage from a cartographic historian who ought to have stuck to his area of expertise. This book is a mish-mash of politically correct essays on the evils of imperialism, racism, eurocentrism, etc. as expressed in maps. Harley was never one to let a trendy leftist ideology go unabsorbed and it shows in these tepid and unreadable essays. A fine example of what's wrong with contemporary academic thought."
1,Very cheap way to get a classic story,"Peter Rabbit is a classic primarily because of its illustrations, and on that most important point, this Dalmatian Press edition fails.The color on the illustrations is over-saturated. The paintings look dark, ""wet"" and blurry. Perhaps the latter is a result of too much enlargement.Thin covers and stapled binding in the great tradition of Scholastic. (sarcasm intended)Still, this cost a buck. (Wonder if it came from the Dollar Spot at Target?) And it does provide a fuller telling of the story than some truncated editions (such asWhere's Peter Rabbit?: A Lift-the-Flap Book (Lift the Flap)). That means your child will enjoy such gems as:""Don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden. Your father had an accident there. He was put in a pie."" (!!!)"
1,Doesn't Stick,"I'm not sure what is wrong with the tape. The first roll I used was sticky. The rest of the rolls would not stick to cardboard. I have had the tape past the time to return it. I threw out 5 rolls, what a waste."
1,Quite a letdown,"This book shows no trace of the writing that has earned Mike Resnick a Hugo and Nebula award. Dull, repetitious, unimaginative stories about ridiculous one-dimensional 'heros', as he calls them.Evidently a book written for young teens judging from the constant boring sexual fantasies/exploits of the characters. It seemed totally pointless. After awhile, I used it to put me to sleep."
2,Under-rated,"This is probably the most underrated movie i have ever seen. I walked into a video store one weekend and couldn't find a movie to watch so the person working the counter suggested 'The Fall'. I was a bit skeptical, but this movie blew me away! I'd suggest it to anyone who enjoys breathtaking cinematography along with stunning locales. Easily my favorite movie."
1,Swift Boat Veterans For Bush,"That is what they should rename their ""organization."" It would suit them much better. Not only is this book a new low in politics...but i'll go as far as saying that this is a new low in humanity..PERIOD. In trying to discredit John Kerry, all they really have done is discredit themselves. Pathetic."
1,"Catching up with the Skolian Empire, without the sex","If you follow the Saga of the struggling Skolian Empire, this volume will fill in some gaps, on the same timeline as Ascendant Sun(keep it to hand while reading). The oft-in-the-background Pharaoh, Dehya attempts to catch up with events, friends and family.As a first person storyline, this time the narrator was unconvincing. Asaro managed this trick well twice with Kelric in earlier stories, so not sure what happened here.... Political earthquakes also rumble almost unnoticed..."
2,This was part i needed to get vac going again.,I have been extremly pleased with my Bissel powerforce vac and it has outlasted my last three other brands life combined !!!! I was therefore sad when the belt broke to find out local retailed didn't carry anymore. I didn't want to throw out other wise great vac. I was happy to find on line and price was great and delivery fast .The belt is a breeze to install and my Bissell is performing as new again; Thanks a million !!!
2,a good thing,This radio is small for going walk and the sound is very clear and loudy. It can receive almost all the coasts that I like it.
2,Absolutely absorbing and elegantly written biography of a great man!,"Incredibly interesting and really a good, hard look at the life of John Milton and what inspired him and what aroused his wrath. His poems are eternal and deal with things secular and spiritual. His words have come down to us through many centuries and they are still as powerful as the day he wrote them. What a true genius! What a stunningly beautiful biography...I couldn't put it down."
1,Interesting Theories but Not of Much Practical Value,"The single most valuable item in the book was need often stated need to think of powder mixing as a different process from liquid mixing. The two strive for similar ends but by very different mechanisms. As a chemical engineer with much liquid mixing experience, this was useful. But having purchased this book to aid in solving some pressing powder mixing problems, the empasis on theory was a bit disappointing."
2,A wakeup call,"Total Money Makeover is book both for those who are in debt and know they have a problem and those who are oblivious to their problems. It begins with a powerful argument on why the American lifestyle (buy now, bankrupt later) will lead to a retirement involving Alpo. For those who are convinced, it then presents 5 steps to financial freedom. For those who need to get out of debt, this is the book. If you just need to stop spending willy-nilly and develop a cash-flow plan, I recommend Dave's other book, Financial Peace: Revisited."
2,Great muzzle -- Be careful when choosing size,"The first Best Fit muzzle I bought was at Petsmart, where they only carried sizes up to a 7. I had not measured our dog's muzzle before shopping, but since she weighs just under 100 lbs. (a Great Pyrenees), I thought that a 7 might work. The size 7 was far too small for her, but fit our 65 lb. Husky mix just right. I measured the Pyrenees's muzzle before ordering online. The circumference was 12"", putting her in the size 8 category, though she weighs much less than the other breeds listed there. So do be sure to go by muzzle size as opposed to weight. The muzzle works quite well & is easy to put on the dog. It has helped tremendously with toenail trimming, which has been a big issue for the Pyrenees. She is also a very drooly dog, so it's great to have a muzzle that's easy to clean."
2,my life :),We love this purchase of Married... with Children: The Complete Series. There was always one episode that I wanted to see and on TV they would never play it so with this complete series I can see the ones I want to see any time. What a great buy at the price. the delivery time was great and they were in great shape on arrival. Highly recommend.
1,Very disappointed,"""Change Mah Name"" was not included on the CD. The song strongly influenced the audience as well as the character, DJ. I would have bought the CD just for that song. Shame on whomever decided against including it."
1,This is garbage!!,"Wow, they actually put this ""anti-classic"" on CD. Seriously, this is a very bad album. Practically none of the ""superstars"" can sing, other than Jimmy Hart, and they are mostly stuck with dumb novelty songs. Not that they fare too well when they sing ""serious"" songs. Nikolai Volkoff has a decent baritone voice, but his thick accent renders ""Cara Mia"" unintelligible. Probably the worst singing here is by Roddy Piper, although Captain Lou Albano gives him a run for the money. If you are a fan of bad celebrity singing, you should get this album."
2,Great squeeky toy,Most dog toys last hours maybe days before she chews them up this has lasted months.
1,poorly made and cheap looking,i ordered this bag based on review and can't say i agree. it is very cheaply made with not one storage pocket (where i put my dog's leash when i'm toting her) my chihuahua who is a bit oversized (not fat) could not lie down and there is no comfortable way for her head to stick out (something she insists on). the color is overly bright. i returned it.
1,bandwagon publishing?,"This is an unauthorized autobiography. The author is not critical of Kirk Franklin, but it is a low budget production. There are interviews with people who are not close to Franklin. The author did not spend much money for video clips. There is narration with still pictures, not very captivating. There is a picture of Jeremiah Wright with no mention of his association with Kirk Franklin, if any. Chronologically disjointed with some repetition. What a testimony Kirk Franklin has! They should have done much better."
2,THE BEST FOREVER!,"YOU JUST CAN NOT-NOT READ THIS BOOK. YOU JUST HAVE TO. I LOVE IT SOOO MUCH! THE ENDING KEPT ME WAKE UP THE WHOLE ENTIRE NIGHT! I CAN'T BELEIVE IT! IT TOTALLY MAKE ME LOST MY FEAR IN THE DARK. IT'S UNBELEIVEABLE! I FELT LIKE MY SOUL HAS LEFT ME. THIS IS THE BEST. YOU'RE GONNA REGRET IT IF YOU DON'T EVEN DARE TO READ IT. I LOVE THE ENDING THOUGH IT BUG ME BUT I STILL LOVE IT. POOR SEYMORE...I FELT THE SAME WAY THAT HE DOES EVEN THOUGH HE'S ONLY AN IMAGINARY CHARECTER. TO ME I FELT LIKE I'M PART OF THE BOOK. ACUALLY THE BOOK RELATED TO ME ALOT THAT'S WHY I LIKE IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW PIKE COULD OF PUT THE STORY TOGETHER AND REMEMBERED THE DETAILS BUT HEY, HE DONE IT. I'M TOTALLY CRAZY FOR HIS BOOKS. IF I DON'T GET THEM I GO CRAZY."
1,"bleh - mundane writing, boring & unbelievable characters,","oh the horrors of poor writing.Plodding through ""Rama Revealed"" was a wate of my time and I won't be wasting any more on it.My recommendation is to skip it, I couldn't get past 25% of this book. Off the top of my head, read a good Greg Bear SF novel instead."
2,Good for the experienced programmer.,"The book covers a lot of the ground cementing the new concepts that have been introduced to the exam. Specifically the DESIGN stuff (which had me fooled from the moment that i read this on the exam objectives). They also hightlight the fact that you have to get into a Microsoft Mind Set, showing examples of the questions that as an experienced programmer you would not develop for but microsoft are expecting you to answer with.The DHTML ommission is a minor/major mistake. Depending on your access to the internet. Searching MSDN will get you better articles regrading this.Over all a well set out and clear exam book that should be used either as a book for brushing up on the concepts that you are familar with, or as I am using it to prompt further reading.Have fun"
1,"Why does it say ""thriller"" in the synopsis?","I had high hopes for this movie. I thought, Robin Williams + Thriller = good movie. Everything about this movie falls short. It is NOT a thriller, for anyone even slightly intellegent it gives you way to much information and takes every last bit of thrill out of it. The acting is strange and the dialogue brought me disturbing close to thinking the writer must have been a pedefile. I do not recommend this movie for anyone."
1,Didn't work,"I purchased this and replaced the lens. Now the xbox will not even reconise that a dvd has been placed in the drive. I will spin the dvd and act like it is going to read it, but nothing"
2,I was 6 yrs old when my mother took we to see this!,This was the first movie my mother and grandmother took me to see. I have never been to a indoors movie before. I enjoyed watching all the stories but the one who took my heart away was elves! I have the album that was sold from the movie. This is a keeper!
1,Have Mercy,"Just let me say that is very very rare that I put down a book but this one and I quote Dorothy Parker ""Should be thrown with great force"" Ugh I got halfway through this book hoping against hope that it would grab hold and I would start to like at least one of the characters but none of them from start to finish have any redeeming qualities... That was not the only problem... Why was there so much detail on mundane things that were completely unnecessary to the story... Don't bother!!! This is truly one of the worst books I have ever read..."
1,great until the battery pack dies-can't replace,This worked great for about 2 years. Then it wouldn't hold a charge and found out the battery pack can't be replaced. Wa-hoo...so I have a gadget that has no power...but lots of accessories that I am guessing won't fit on the other models.I wrote to B&D; and they didn't even reply!! NICE! I wouldn't spend 50.00 again....I am looking to see if the other models use the same accessories...but I doubt it. I am tired of products with planned deaths!
2,chamillionaire the sound of da hot lyrics &hot beats,the sound of revenge is a hot cd and you shold buy it today becuz u hav to have to have his cd in youre cd plya
2,It works for me,"I started using this deodorant about a week ago after picking some up on a whim, and I love it. It does last the full 24 hours for me and possibly longer. My favorite thing about it is how great my skin feels there now. It feels soft, smooth, and clean. It's awesome. I apply it right after getting out of the shower (i.e. after I've shaved), and I haven't experienced any burning or redness. Of course, it is winter right now, so we'll see how well this does for me during summer. Hopefully it works because I never want to go back to using antiperspirants."
2,An Icon In Oklahoma!,"As a rabid Oklahoma fan, I had this book for some time before I actually read it. Whether the reader loves Barry or hates him, after reading this book, admiration and respect will develop for this popular coach.I chuckled as I read some of the stories, and cried when I read others. Barry holds nothing back and his personality comes through. This man is Hall of Fame anyday, in my book."
2,Gigi Products are GREAT!,My wife has several products by Gigi & loves them all. These Edge Wax Spatulas are great for when she waxes her eyebrows - the pointed corners make it easy to shape her eyebrows perfectly!
1,review,This is not only funny it is idiotic. Romania one of the next trouble parts? Laughable! This is written by a person that has no idea of the actual life there but only what they may have heard. Armchair nonsense.
2,Food for the soul,"Angel touches my soul. Every time I listen to this song I can feel it deep inside. I close my eyes and can feel chills running through my body. I've never experienced a song like this before. My brother died last Dec. and it helps me to know that he is safe and ""in the arms of the angels"". Sarah McLachlan is wonderful!!!"
1,Wish I had never purchased,"My son has a castle that he loves and when his cousin comes over he plays all the time with the castle. For my nephew's pbithday I puchased him this castle. It is different from son's (his castle is one piece). I understood that this castle had different pieces and that it wasn't one piece. I did also think the pieces would be held together in some way - they aren't. Every time we get the castle set up the pieces fall over if you play with the castle.I am soo disappointed. This is one time where paying less money for a one piece castle would have been a much better bet.Now, after one month, the castle sits in its box unplayed with. The drawbridge connector also broke off and had to be glued."
1,Could have been better,"Although the story was quite enjoyable, the level of realism was reduced by the swiftness with which ideas are run through and the lack of detail given. For example the main protagonist watches lots of videos but we never get any details of what's in the videos, merely overviews or generalities. In this way it was hard to read, because so much simple stuff you wanted to read about is kept at arm's length.The ending is dubious, like the first review said it is an ending of the ""make your own mind up"" type, but it does imply that if something is good what does it matter what the truth is behind it.Only got two stars because of the concept, I did not find this book fulfilling."
2,HIGH ENERGY KICK- BUTT KICKBOXING!,"Very good tape... MUCH better that Tae Bo! I have a friend who is a beginner to exercise & almost threw out her back doing Tae Bo, but can get through the 1st segment on this tape. Great for beginners and intermediate/advance (2nd segment) who are looking for a tape that is challenging!"
1,Says Explicit Lyrics but it's censored!!,What the hell?? I got my all time favorite hip-hop album and what a disappointment!!! Protect ya Neck is censored!!! They put this funny noise when they say the 'bad words'!!! The thing is Amazon's product info said explicitly EXPLICIT LYRICS!!! Come on!!!!!! Had it been the real deal I would have most definitely rated the product FIVE stars!! What a disappointment...It even features the Parental Advisory thing on the cover!
1,"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 30","One may wonder why John Huston trusted Dominique Sanda with Mrs. Smith's role. Was it in order to give an even colder atmosphere to this film about Cold War ? Did he think that the final scene would be more memorable if it was played by the constip... err! by the uptight French actress ? I don't know. Still, I liked a lot the Irish part of The Mackintosh Man with an interesting car chase and beautiful landscapes. But, as it's the 3rd or the 4th time that I see this film and as I nonetheless always forget its plot, let's keep it reserved to John Huston completists. Only."
2,More than just one song here!,"It seems a great shame that many people have only shown interest in this album due to the contribution of the late George Harrison. Certainly there is plenty here that not all will enjoy but there is also a great amount here which surpasses Harrison's work but lack his status in the US. Both Suggs and Paul Weller(vocalists with the biggest bands of the early eighties in Britain, Madness & the Jam)produce excellent and well rounded songs that capture their own styles. Sam Brown, massively underrated everywhere creates a beautiful and touching melody that would possibly stand as the most talked about track if she had the fame of other female pop vocalists and Marc Almond of Soft Cell surpasses his original version of 'Say hello, Wave goodbye' with the help of Jools Holland.Overall, not an album for everyone but certainly an album to be judged by the music alone and nothing else."
1,BigEye is Big Ripoff!,"Although the manification ratio is great and the lens does not distort, the manifying glass is very cheaply made. The plastic reminds me of a cheap toy bought a a junk store. The plastic handle totally disintegrated the first time I used it and fell off. So, now I don't have a magnifying glass to use and I'm out the money it cost to buy it. I am very disappointed in this product. I would rather pay more to have them redesign this product using a better quality hard plastic for the lens rim and especially the handle."
1,Doormat it is,"I was very disappointed in this book. As a librarian I look for realistic reads for the teens. It has some realistic elements, but wraps up way to quickly to be real. I found it very choppy and hard to follow in some areas. Time spent better elsewhere."
2,Good Theme,"I had seen the movie in regular Hi-D and I got to tell you, Blu ray was as different as da and night!"
2,A wonderful look into the lives of the endangered.,"Being a Science Fiction Comedy writer, Douglas Adams makes learning about endangered species a joy, rather than learning about them from a textbook. Of course, being that his journey took place over twenty years ago, his facts and figures have changed, but this book still gives a great viewpoint into the lives of those that try and save these species. Humor and education combined, for anyone interested, this is a great read."
2,"ODD, BUT GOOD","Igby Goes Down was an extremely witty and entertaining movie. It had some parallels with ""Catcher in the Rye,"" most notably, the main character, Igby. ""Igby Goes Down"" and ""Catcher and the Rye's"" main characters [Holden Caufield] were both outcasts with troubled lives. Although other than that, the similarities ended. The reason this movie worked is that even though Igby made some bad decisions, one still cared about him Kieran Culkin did an excellent part as what has become his niche, the sarcastic, troublemaking pariah. The supporting cast was also excellent with actors in roles one might not expect them to inhabit. (Susan Surandon, Bill Pullman, Claire Danes) This movie was really good, and I would definitely suggest anyone to see it, especially if the person loves the unusual."
2,I'm doin' it!,"Prozac Free, that is! I have been suffering from depression sinse I was a young teenager and attempting to use anti-depressants to treat the problem for the past 12 months, to no avail. Then I read ""Prozac Free"" and found that I really identified with some of the contributers' stories, so I sought out homeopathic treatment and havn't looked back since. That was 3 months ago now. I haven't had 90 good days in a row in over 15 years!""Prozac Free"" explores depression and treatment in a no-fuss, down to earth kind of way, and then uses individuals' stories to illustrate (1) different kinds of dominant feelings within depression, and (2) the different types of treatment used. I would recommend that a beginner to homeopathy start with something more general, though."
1,Broke after 4 months of use,"My hubby was super pleased with this shaver until one day the mechanism just stopped working. Going to have to look for parts for it, or see whether its cheaper just to buy a whole new shaver. Not too pleased, paid around $84 for it with tax and not happy at all that it broke in just 4 months."
2,"HOT, HOT ,HOT","After reading several of Henley's books, I've decided that this one is the most provacative.Great steamy sex scenes as well as a great story."
1,Great Movie - flawed DVD playback,"Great family movie, terrific cgi and a cute storyline.But the standard version DVD continues to flash an annoying icon in the upper righthand corner of the screen as if someone has tried to select an alternate viewing angle, even though none has been selected. This has happened on two copies of the DVD we've purchased. Are other people experiencing this? Is this possibly a flaw since the DVD is also produced on Blu-Ray (which I don't have) where they may have provided alternate views (or other material that you can jump out to during playback) which the standard version doesn't have but is may be trying to access?"
1,Problem with batteries,"for me the machine is good,but those batteries discharger by inselfand I need explanation why,and other problem is :I try to find batteries for saleto replace,but is imposible to find.please helpme to find a batt or I has to returned, and if any kind of batteryhas to discharge is better to return.Now This is I beliebed:Those batt your send me was older,why discharge to next day.please answer my question and if you not have answer for this is better to return.Thank youDavid Argueta"
1,"Britney's voice is poor, even for HER","Sad to say it because Britney used to actually try to sing. Now we have a raspy voiced Britney slugging out a vocal on ""My Prerogative,"" that Bobby Brown did so terrifically. Not a very good remake. and the ""Hits??"" Questionable at best. Some of her good songs that became hits early in career. Not much there anymore."
1,misleading,"The seller made was on the DVD movie purchase site with this musical score only for the movie, misleading had to return after some hassle to do so."
2,GET THIS!!!!!!,"This is one of the most essential 80's METAL albums, emphasis on the word metal. On the cover, they may look like just another poppy hair band that never really made it. Actually, Lizzy Borden was much heavier, sort of like a cross between Queensryche and WASP. Menace To Society is probably their best album. The lyrics are mostly about bad kids wreaking havoc upon eveything and everybody. Cool. Most of the songs are horns-in-the-air hard rockers, but there is a power ballad, Ursa Minor. It has a prog sound to it, with heavy Queensryche influence. This is one spectacular metal album that shows how heavy metal was meant to be played: loud, fast, and uncomprimising."
2,There's no one better!!!!!!,Jay-z is the king of hip-hop. He has taken rap music and has brought it to a new level. Furturistic beats and tight rhymes are all over his new album. It's a Hard Knock Life is an instant classic. It's the best addition to anyone's cd collection.
2,James Fenimore Cooper,This is a story taking place in my favorite era of american history and therefor I would like to give 5 star. I deduct 1 star coz of missing Uncas in the story.
1,Haven't these folks anything better to do?,"Although this assemblage of vignettes was written and directed by four sets of folks, and features four sets of actors, it's uniformly unfunny throughout. Everybody overacts like crazy -- I assume because they realize the material needs as much pumping up as it can get. The most intriguing feature is Tim Roth's hypertwitchiness as he responds to each cue tossed at him with about six takes in rapid-fire succession."
1,Review,"This is the first of Kathy Reichs books i have read (actually I never made it through the whole book). I will more than likely not read any more of her novels, too slow."
1,Better options available,"This cable worked for a little while, but it was still insert remove insert remove insert remove until it caught the signal.I sent it back and purchased the ""Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable With Ethernet"" instead, and that works like a charm.Avoid!"
2,"Easy to use, high quality for simple usage.",I am only listening to a tape that is half an hour and the quality is excellent. I have not used it to record so I cannot speak to that. Very handy!
2,"Not the best , but it certainly doesn't suck!","Many are complaining that this doesn't sound like a Maiden album and a lot of the songs are out of character for them. That's true but that doesn't mean the material is weak - just different. If you like Bruce's solo stuff then you'll love this album because that's mostly what you get. To me, the last four songs are the best, maybe just because the two songs before those are pretty bad... but it really kicks into high gear with The Apparition, Judas Be My Guide, Weekend Warrior, and Fear of the Dark. A fantastic finish to an album that seriously drags in the middle portion. Out of the twelve songs, four should have been left out, which would give you the Maiden you're used to - an album with eight classic tracks."
2,Such a great book! Can't wait to read the others!,"It is soooo good! I borrowed a copy but had to come to Amazon.com to buy my own copy! If you want a good fiction book that will not get old and you want to keep it going even at the end, this is the book!!!"
1,DON'T BOTHER,"What a crappy product. All packaging, no substance. The ""lotion"" is just alchol. There is no scent to speak of. At thirty five bucks a pop, this is a huge rip-off. You'd be better off buying Aqua Velva or Old Spice. This stuff is really disapointing. Don't even bother buying it as a gift for someone you don't like. It's not worth it."
1,Just call me Lefty,"I ordered these for my son's friend for Christmas.. much to my embarrassment he returned them to me, after he went to go work out. He brought them over to my house and told me to try on the gloves... I put on the first glove, the left one.. I went to put on the other glove to find out it was also a left handed glove. I guess you get what you pay for. The $7.00 wasn't worth re-boxing them, going to the post office and waiting for another pair.. I just drove to the Sports store and got him a new set.. Left & Right!"
1,One of my first Amazon disappointments,"I purchased 2 of the Germ Terminator Sanitizers. My husband and I both had negative experiences in separate bathrooms. It melts some of the toothbrushes and, at best, can cause the bristles to be bent, dried out and twisted. Worst of all is the burning odor that caused us to search the entire house for the source of the fire. We tossed them both, even tho' we only had them in use for a few short weeks.Pass this one up!"
2,I AM SPEACHLESS!!,"Wow!! This recording is amazing. It has totally blown me away. Everything is so crisp and precise. Bernadette Peters has done it again! Her voice continues to glow throughout the CD. Her emotions that she puts into each and every song are incredible. She is joined be her broadway newcomer Tammy Blanchard who also makes her role very emotional! John Dosset shines in the role of Herbie. This is without a doubt the BEST recording of ""Gypsy"" ever made! I give it 10 stars. An absolute must!!"
1,rip off!!!!!,"when i saw the picture of the fingerpick, i thought it was made of metal and it looked very sturdy, it turns out that the astute seller changed the lightings of the picture so that the pick would look like its actually worth 2 dollars, even though its a crappy piece of plastic that breaks easily. i spent 7 dollars on 4 picks that ended up snapping when i played, it also slides off easily so whenever i play, it gets stuck in my guitar. DONT BUY IT!"
1,1 charge and then it was gone.....,We were happy with this opener until the 1st time we tried to recharge it. Plugged it into the charger for 8 hours and when we tried to use it the following morning it only made it about 1 inch before giving out. Plugged it into the charger again for another 8-10 hours.....same results.The good news is customer service was courteous and is going to replace it. I am a little apprehensive about getting the same model although c.s. said they have little trouble with this model.We'll see about that.......
2,"(I'm on bended knee) - ""Not Worthy.."".","I see so many reviews, and my only hope is that through the voice of my humble opinion, one more person will pick up this outstanding novel and read it through to the end to be as moved and awed as I was by this truly amazing story.Late at night (very late, because I couldn't put it down), while reading Dominic's grandfather's book within a book (the cherry on the sundae), I would tip-toe to the living room and shut the door so that I could read and laugh out loud and not wake the whole house.If you love a good story that gives you memorable characters - get this one - it is phenomenal."
1,"light on yoga, heavy on boring messages","I bought this DVD for my 3 year old and I to do yoga together. I was very disappointed--so much of the program is little vignettes about nature, animals, etc., with just little snippets of actual yoga poses. Would have loved to have seen more fun/direction about the poses themselves than the environmental messaging. Don't get me wrong, I'm a tree hugger, but it was a bit much. Also, you can tell it was produced at least ten years ago. Everything's pretty dated..."
2,Hoping that the book and the audio are republished!,"""Once there was a little Fird...just an ordinary Fird, part fish, part bird...""When this book, and the audio version were in print, I purchased so many hardbacks, paperbacks, cassettes, records and even a stuffed animal Fird as gifts that I lost count. It's an excellent 'chapter book' for young readers. There is a moral to every chapter,there are colorful 'two-feature creatures' that encourage a child's imagination and a fun story-line.When my children were young, it was their favorite request...and they always wanted me to imitate the voices they heard on the audio version (Joel Grey was awesome--both narrating and singing!) I read the book so often that I had it memorized.Now I have grandchildren and they too love the book. The only hardcopy I have left is becoming worn out with love!The author has been trying to get this work of art published for years...I hope that it happens soon!Definitely a five-star book...and audio production!"
1,POORLY PRODUCED! - DISAPPOINTMENT :0(,"I plan on seeing this very talented group of men, at the Anaheim Pond, and the only thing I know I can count on is the great music they have all wrote together or apart from one another. Of them all I am a BIG FAN OF NEIL YOUNG and look forward to seeing and hearing his music live. But when I saw on this album who produced it, I was very disappointed on the poor production value. And what's the cover suppose the mean? That they are Grandpas now. Who cares all I want is good music. And certainly don't get it from this album by any means. Neil doesn't even sound like himself. Anyway I have every one of anything these guys have written, and I have that to keep me happy for now."
1,Book is great but buying it from Amazon was not,"The book is great but buying it from Amazon was not. There is a code inside the spine of the dust jacket. I bought the book as ""new"" but there was no code in the back to take the online test at the end of the book. I returned the book and got a refund but if I didn't know about the code I would have read 1/2 the book before learing about the code and I don't know how Amazon would have handled a returned 1/2 read book."
2,50 mil estrellas,"Se acerca el final (apenas faltan dos meses para Julio 2007 pero parece una eternidad). ya no es tan fácil librarse de vol... you-know-who. el desenlace no me lo esperaba, mis ojos no podían creer quien parece ser ""el malo de la película"" ojo, tengo 36 años recién cumplidos y les digo que un poco de fantasía me viene bien en estos tiempos del ""cólera"" (si les gusta Gabo, ahi tienen otro buen libro :)"
2,After almost 50 years-still a good book,"This is a very good book to read. The conflicts that go on in the story simultaneously are very good. Sometimes it jumped back in time, instead of staying with the spider story as I wanted it to, but it was all very well done. The emotions of the title character were well done, although I didn't agree with him at times, or with the things he did, it was just my perspective on it. The ending was a little neat to me. It ended a little different than I would have originally guessed. I enjoyed this book. It is very well done. It is ageless in the fact, that it was written 50 yrs ago, but could easily be placed in todays world. The characters and they way they react are timeless."
1,Sound Quality,The tv was fine in all respects except the sound quality. The sound was tinny and garbeld. This model did not have external speaker capability. The picture was great.
2,Great album!,"Sheryl Crow is one of the best!Anyone who's heard All I Wanna Do, Soak Up the Sun, First Cut Is the Deepest or Everyday Is a Winding Road and liked any of them should buy the album. Those are the 4 best songs in my opinion. Lots of other goods ones as well."
1,"Yes, unfufilled","I read this becuase my husband's a devoted Moorcock fan (they're on first name terms- isn't this internet thing amazing?) I'll diplomatically say it's just not my cup of tea - there are just too many lists of fabrics, metals, walls that makes the prose unwieldy. I did love the fact that the most powerful character was a woman - exaggerated, but still human and I can't actively dislike a book that concludes that a really good orgasm is good for queen and country. So much SF/ fantasy (especially back when this was written) seemed to be written by men who'd never actually met a real live woman, so I'm impressed by 'Mike's' fem cred."
2,OOO... love the boots,"I bought these boots because they are so unique, and sexy. They have a pointed toe, and 3.5"" skinny heels. They don't pinch my feet, but I still wouldn't recommend wearing them all day long. The outer material is a fabric, I don't know how to describe it - but it's sturdy and looks good.My only complaint is about the seller. I ordered a size 6.5 and they originally shipped me an 8.5 (which wasn't even an option from Amazon.com). When you order from this store via amazon.com, the size you ordered does not appear in any of the confirmation emails so you sorta have to pray that it'll be correct. Shipping is expensive too."
2,Great Product for 3rd Trimester,The Boppy Wedge is a lifesaver in the 3rd trimester when your tummy feels really heavy and its hard to sleep. It really helped reduce the pain below my waist from sleeping on my side. Just prop it under your tummy and it holds your tummy up. I've noticed that the baby doesn't wake up as much or try to adjust her positioning in my tummy when I switch sides anymore.It also works well for the back. When I watch TV in bed I like to prop several pillows behind me for support the wedge works real well to support my lower back while laying on my back in bed.This is a really good product and the price is right too. I've been thinking about buying another one to use at work to use as a back cushion.
1,Excellent illustrations,"If you're looking for a good interpretation of excellent illustrations, then this is your book! The illustrations are par none, but the writing lacks substance. Much of the descriptions are but interpretations, some based on fact, but many imagined. Readers looking for a very broad overview will enjoy this book. Those looking for detail about the ship or about the history of the time-period would do better with something else."
1,"Great features, but doesn't keep time","The one thing I want out of a clock radio is the abiliy to keep time. Even though I do get the atomaic clock signal where I live, it screwed up twice within the first 3 months I had it:1) One time, it jumped ahead 20 years. Only an issue because the day of the week it jumped to was a weekend, and since I had the alarm set to ring on weekedays only, it didn't wake me up that day.2) The other time, the clock suddenly moved ahead by 30 minutes.Unfortunately, since you can't disable the atomic clock feature, I can no longer trust this unit. However, I do like the features of it enough that I decided to buy another unit from Emerson without the auto time-setting function."
1,I Didn't Like It-What Happened to Mr. Patterson here?,"This book started out interestingly enough, but after about 100 pages-it really bored me a lot. The pieces just didn't seem to fit together and the story took off in other strange directions that was difficult to relate to the first part of it. Frankly, it had me confused.The other books in this series were great, but James lost his touch on this one. For another thing, the characters were underdeveloped!"
1,A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR CORNWELL! THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLE!!,"I've read almost all of Cornwell's books, and this is by far, the worst book she has ever written. What happened to Scarpetta? This was one of the most boring books that I have ever read. Don't even bother to read it!"
1,"Corn, anyone?",Good grief! How corny can you get? And is Judith McNaught still writing? Because all her books seem to be reprints of reprints.
1,"A horrible, horrible, horrible movie","I want my hour and a half back. Nothing about this movie was good. It wasn't thrilling, it wasn't sexy, it wasn't funny. It, however, was full of bad acting, bad plot lines, and lame ideas. Don't waste your time. And by the way. Angelina Jolie- NOT hot with the short hair."
1,misleading,"After waiting a reasonalble length of time for my DVD. I was really excited aboutreceiving it. I had tried to find it locally but to no availe. When I got everything set up to watch it, much to my surprise there was a note accross thescreen stating (this product cannot be viewed in your region). Needless to sayI was disappointed, so I tried it again and the same message came up. Guess Ineed to toss this one up to experience???? It was for the DVD Sweet Home Alabama.I have not had any problems with anything else purchased from Amazon. BK"
2,Simple and easy to use,"What a great pump! I couldnt ask for more for this price, I am very happy with this pump."
1,part thre and one are identical,"Of this symphonie, part 3 and one are identical. Above that there is some coughing in this music. The pace I think is not right. Compare this bargain to other recordings and you will notice that it is not bad. Some explanation about Cesare Cantieri and Suddeutsche Philharmonie would not be out of place. It is good to begin with, but i for myself have abandonned this recording for other interpretations by Daniel Barenboim and/or Vladimir Delman. One can obrtain these recordings from second sound shops. For the long term, that would be better. Elegant music= Yes. More than that no Two stars only Music quality is allright in general."
1,Carbon copies,"Well, I have to compliment Britney on keeping up with her image. This CD is very sensual. Seems like all the songs involve her, a guy, & sex. And in all the songs, there's a standard beat, & some girls singing higher than Britney (who is singing low). Some of the songs borrow things from other artists & one of the songs Britney just re-did. There is nothing outstanding about the way this CD was done, and there is nothing stunning about her vocals. A good artist wouldn't have to promote themselves by wearing revealing clothes & dancing among writhing bodies. Sorry everyone."
1,Made No Sense # 2,Like the 1st one I didnt think this one made a whole lot of sense either. I actually think this one made less sense than the 1st one. Like I said in my reviw for the 1st movie if your not familiar with these movies please rent first.
1,just a rehash of the official CC documentation,"If you are looking for a book that will help you get started on the tortuous painful path to a CC certificate, save your money. This is just a rehash, in Potomac bureaucratese, of the extremely unenlightening and totally unhelpful documentation that's available for free on the CC website. And of course it's WAY out of date."
2,this backpack rocks,"Amateur/pro photographer. I use this bag to hold my pro-am kit. Fits camera with lens and room for 5 more lenses. I have a 11-16mm, 90mm, 35mm, 50mm, and 200-400mm and all accessories. No other backpack I found held as much."
1,Tears at Toe Opening,These fins tore/ripped at toe opening after 3 months of normal use and were then useless. I will not purchase them again and will probably not purchase another Speedo product after using this one.
2,Excellent Product,"All:I have had this camera for a week and really like it.PROS: Everything the ads say are true. Great pics.Fast startup and snap. Great for people who dont wantto mess with lot of manual settings, although you can dothat too.CONS: Have to think hard for these, but the lens is in a spot that you have to be careful not to cover with your finger when snapping a pic. Also, dont buy the Minolta camera case that you can get to fit the camera. It is a poorly designed case."
2,A great read,This book offers a rational proof to the existence of God. I believe that if you are looking for proof this is the book for you. I have always been a believer so this just solidified my knowledge further. It also answers many questions non believers have about the Bible. It gives good reasoning about the validity of the Bible and how you can accept some of the seemingly improvable stories and lessons.
2,A Tough Act To Follow,"""Curtians"" The Broadway Musical was fun and holds up ""pretty good but not great"" to the Kander and Ebb reputation but fortunately, their music holds up quite well!The wonderful thing about this CD is, you can get the jist of the entire show and enjoy the CD for itself.The music is good and the performing cast on the CD are a scream, with Debra Monk delivering the funniest lines. David Hyde Pierce brought home the TONY, and this CD is so good, it gives you a hint why."
1,Very disappointed!,"I love Michael Madsen, but except for maybe 1 poem, this book was terrible. I am not a big poetry lover, however I have 2 friends that love both poetry & M.M. & they didn't like it either! I couldn't give it away, I begged both of them to take it for their own collections, but they snorted and gave it back me quickly! The few poems that actually seemed to mean something were quite depressing & made him seem very lonely. I would advise you not to buy this book, or to get a cheap, used copy first! Mine is still looking for a good home! =)"
2,YOU WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER DISH BRUSH AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!,"I bought this item in March of 2011.Almost 2 years later, and with CONSTANT, REGULAR, FREQUENT daily use in our business office kitchen, the bristles have kept their integrity.This is wholly unlike most dish brushes which lose their shape and become annoyingly flat on the side you use the most, thereby rendering the brush USELESS.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The only note for potential buyers is the brush I bought 2 years ago had a completely black handle, not the black/white one shown in the photo, so don't be shocked if you get something different!"
2,Verry Nice Record,I have listened this record slowly and is better than Bonampak. This record have new adjustments.Buy it !!!!
2,Good Filter,"Bought it to replace the old one on my AEM short ram inlet. Easy to clean and access than oem. Frees up the inlet, I have better accelleration and slightly better mpg. Used with the Injen Heat Shield since my old filter got damaged and would heat soak from exposure from the engine/exhaust manifold radiant heat. New filter came with thinner clamp that will fit the bracket nibs on the Injen Heat Shield BTW. Older AEM filter clamp was slightly too wide."
1,how does it end?,"I have attempted to watch this twice. In each case the disc gets ""hung up/caught"" somewhere in the middle of the viewing and won't move on. I don't know quite how to describe it. I have watched other movies just to be sure it wasn't my DVD player.Sorry"
2,Thanks,"Wow, what a great read. It is helping me on my way to publish the world's most successful magazine. Ever."
1,DRM + SecuRom,"The game is an amazingly fun and innovative scheme. What I can not-> and will not do -> is support EA's draconian idiocy. By increasing DRM and faulty coding related to piracy the game will not run on my PC. I went too the pirates looking for a way to get it to work.So I bought the game, but I am likely returning it and will not go forward with this until it is put in a state ready for consumption and for our rights."
1,skip this one,"This has a nicely varied assortment of projects, not just wearables, but it is nothing too fantastic-- car lot pennants? Placemats? They may be celebrities, but they arent doing any mind-blowing design. Another problem with this book is that some of the projects require a wide-spread crafting knowledge (screenprinting and crochet) and the supplies for those things (screen and ink, squeegee, etc) which could get a little spendy. the wearables are not that cute or inspired (applying rows of snaps, embroidering on the shoulder? children could have come up with this stuff. check it out at the library first. This wasnt at all what I was looking for, but it might inspire you. It did have great photos."
1,Bad quality,"Although the six paintings are all famous ones, the quality is really bad. You can make better one by print yourself.."
2,Dumonde steals the show.........again,"Just Like Marc Aurel's previous release, ""The Sun"", Running proves to be a smash hit when remixed by the superstar group Dumonde. The big line in this remix will send chills down your spine and force your hands into the air. The Dominator mix is of fine quality as well. Yet unlike the Dominator mix of The Sun, this mix tends to stay in the general boundaries of the original mix. The Dominator mix of The Sun ventured off into amazing territory and gave the original mix a fine makeover. Here, I expected the same, but was a bit disappointed when I found out that it is pretty much just like the original mix. But still, a fine mix indeed. But again, The Dumonde remix is the winner here. But with fine material to start off with, i.e. original mix, it's no wonder Dumonde was able to create another masterpiece. Buy this either on CD or vinyl, not only for a superior Dumonde mix, but also because Marc Aurel has put out another fine single. Running is already a club hit!"
1,Poor customer service!,"I have had my keyboard 2 years. Within 2 months the lettering on the keys was wearing off which since I type by touch is not a big deal. Now the left riser foot broke. I called Microsoft to buy a replacement and lo and behold they do not sell them and wanted me to buy another keyboard. Seriously? I should spend another $40 for a keyboard because of a 20 cent part even though it is in the warranty period? What a joke. We are such a disposable society today that they would only sell me a new keyboard rather than let me fix it. Sure it puts more money in their pocket while taking it out of mine. Not a chance. It will be a cold day in, well you know, before I buy another Microsoft hardware product. Why should I as they would never allow me to fix it."
1,"Good guide for sightseeing, but NOT for hotels, restaurants","While this book provides fairly accurate guidance regarding natural features and campgrounds, don't use it a reliable guide to travel necessities that are market driven like hotels, restaurants, admission costs, etc. Each time we used the book to choose a hotel, we were surprised and sadly disappointed in either the quality, the cost, or both. The same for recommended restaurants. Admission costs were generally 20% higher than listed. No big deal, but again, for a current publication it fell short in accuracy. It's as if an earlier printing was simply published as current without checking on the accuracy of the contents.Use it as a guide, but not as a reference. I'm sure there are other sources of more accurate information for travelers."
1,Cheap!,I have had this DVD player just 6 weeks and it has already quit working. It will read the disc but the screen has went out! I have only used it 5 or 6 times.
2,"Great instruction,but...","Krav Maga/KAPOP is such a versatile method of defense/offense,that I'd have been surprised if it hadn't been adopted (w/slight modifications) by the Israelis. Having said that,however,I personally find ground scrambling far too vulnerable for my tastes-realistic down & dirty street defense. Good to know,naturally,but not something I'd want to pursue further. Great instructional DVD,however."
2,Erica's review,When I read the book Farwell to Manzanar I thought it was a sad book because the government forced Japanese people to live in internment camps for two years. I think the government did this because they were scared that if Japanese people had contact with Japan then they could give signal to war. I give this book 4 stars because it was a good book but kind of dull.
1,Style over substance...,"Frank Miller continues his ""one trick pony ""act by giving us more style over substance nonsense. If you go to every film that Hollywood releases cause its new, then this is for you. Enjoy!"
2,Best Mouse made,"I have tried many mice over the years. This is by far the best and most functional mouse ever. The scroll wheel is tremendous for web viewing, creating documents and cutting and pasting large documents for business. This works seamlessly with the document switch. If you work with multiple documents and need to cut and paste text between documents for business, this is the mouse for you. I can use this mouse all day with no fatigue. The only drawback I would say is the battery charging and the length of each charge. This isn't an issue if you just think about it every once in a while."
2,Comfortable even in the longest runs,"I bought these shoes for running a full marathon (my other shoes were getting old), and they are very comfortable even after 25 miles."
2,Surprisingly entertaining,It would not have occurred to me to purchase this item. Our 2 year old son received it as a gift and is very happy to spend his time cutting up the fruit.
1,A Feast for Crows,"I found it extremely hard to continue reading, the characters that once held my interest have since been eliminated, the only reason I read it throughout was simply to complete the series."
2,The Best Expansion Pack.....,"I recieved ""The Sims Vacation"" expansion pack today and have had a ball playing it! It is the best expansion pack yet and it is filled with a lot of fun and entertaining activities for your Sims to do. You can either go alone or take your entire family on vacation to either a sun-filled beach, a winter wonderland, or you can just rough it out in the woods. I even think the game runs better now. I recommend buying this expansion and adding more excitment to your already busy Sims life!"
1,Unsafe item!!!,"This is a very unsafe item. The legs do not fit properly into the base, causing the exersaucer to fall apart at any given moment. If I had not been standing within arm's reach of my daughter, she would have gotten hurt when the exersaucer collapsed with her in it. She is only 5 months old and definitely not over the weight limit! This item should be pulled from the market!"
1,Broke,I bought this less than 1 year ago and it just shut down and does not work. It never really picked up that well but I was living with it. Time to find a new vacuum.
2,ok but crapo bands,"I would have agree with Jeda. warped is full of crapo emo screamo bands. Its not about punk anymore its about crap music. This cd is ok, they could of done better maybe some whole wheat bread, and tusnami bomb, but oh well. the one song i hate on this cd the most is track 7 Gogol Bordello - Start Wearing Purple. I sweare its the most annoying song ever ::erases song from cd:: omg i hate it.. but in a nut shell warped tour gets worse and the cd gets craper.. but its still worth the 8 or 9 bucks."
1,Lacked direction,"This book jumped around. There were interesting parts, but it was a hard to stay interested to the end."
2,David is not the Star,"The movie is good, but they could have picked a better lead then David Hasselhoff. His singing is annoying and his acting is dull and boring. HIs co-stars outshine him by far. Coleen Sexton is my favorite performer in this show. True her voice isn't as good as Linda Eders but it is still strong and powerful and her acting is amazing. The rest of the cast is great but she really stood out to me. So get this if you want a good movie, but don't expect much from David because in my opinion he stinks."
2,Kennedy is a master.,"I have read all of William Kennedy's books. I admit to being from Albany, the subject of his books. Kennedy unravels the tales of one of the nation's great ""open"" towns in the U.S.They are history on a more personal level. It will not ast long on the night table."
2,Very readable,"I used this textbook as the basis for my Microbiology course this year as it presents core concepts in very readable language. I supplemented it with more specific, in depth reading and lectures on specific topics associated with each chapter. My students loved the book (though they hated the price!). This is not the typical encyclopedic microbiology text we are used to seeing and thank goodness!"
1,good / bad,"Great song/ bad can't add this to my jukebox list, cd is copy locked. I wanted to add it two my mp3 player, but no I can'tother then take great cd, don't buy is you want to make mp3 and play it from the computer."
2,"Enjoyable, enthralling, and perfect for long drives. (Audio)","This was my first experience with Stephen White and it was an enjoyable one. There are many plot twists and this mystery thriller was a fun adventure. It made me enjoy the drive and rant and rave aloud about some of the characters' choices.The story weaves around an FBI agent female who is responsible for getting a death row inmate out, a shrink who is professionally involved with both the agent and ex-inmate, and a cast of characters that add confusion, passion, and bizarre motivations and twists into the plot.You'll be surprized at the end, but the story will definately keep you interested. I have not read this author before and give it a four star only because I think the motivation for the murder was a weak one and that the ending could have come earlier...but it still was/is a fun and interesting story."
1,Bad.,"Bought this for on the go and emergencies. The strap is too short, and I'm only 5'4"". It barely reaches my waist, so I can't put this on and have it slung on the opposite side of my shoulder. There is no padding on straps, so it is painful to have it for long periods of time. The compartments are helpful, but since it is not sewn to the bottom, some of your stuff could get into other compartments.A bit crude for the price and a huge rip off."
1,Stopped working after 19 months,"Pros:Love the flat profile, does not stick out from wall/outletGives a soft, blue glow, enough to give a little light; use in kitchen and bathroom and overhead lights are not necessary at night;Cons:One reviewer says ""13 years and still working""; I purchased this item 19 months ago and it has stopped working.Amazon return policy does not allow returns after this much time."
1,Gabaldon-A Driving Force,"Diana Gabaldon is a driving force in the romance novel business and has so many levels of intellect-YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!!!!I would rather have really bad indigestion than go and buy another one of these boring books.I think people contemplating buying one of these books should go buy a red hot chilli peppers cd,nirvana's nevermind,Pearl Jam's ten,or go buy the movie Looking For Ali Brandy,or if you are still interested in reading pick up a copy of Anthony Kiedis's Bio Scar tissue out next fall,and if it's fiction you are into well go to the Library and pick out a book instead of spending your money on this waste of time."
1,Smells like old lady,Thought it would smell musky vanillaish but I was wrong it smells like old lady perfume and is to strong
1,"Too much propaganda, too little truth.","Some facts are taken from the real history, then exaggerated, distorted or falsified. Russians would have never won this one of the greatest battles in the world history if they were such idiots as they are shown in this movie. The only worthy episode in the film is the strange sexy scene between main characters. The principal actors play OK. Especially I liked Ed Harris."
2,Insights into Paul's Christology from Epistolary Structure,"Sinclair has provided good insights into Paul's Christology as derived from structural analysis of Paul's undisputed epistles. By unveiling the pastoral intent of those epistles, the author also provides fodder for present day application with textual authority."
1,We should have got Sim City 5 instead,"Life is tough for Will Wright. After coming out with The Sims he seems to have painted himself into a corner with his new release, ""Spore"". The game is novel at first and most of the fun to be had is found in the editor portions of the game. However, beyond that the game is too simplified and I feel that it doesn't have enough replay value. The final space stage is tedious. You never get more than 1 ship and there are constant disasters at your home world. Combat is really hard as well. The real problem with Spore is they had to put 5 scaled-down games in there, so no one part of the game really shines. I've been a fan of Maxis since the original Sim City, so I wanted to like this game. Sadly, I can't give a good recommendation. The whole DRM situation and vice-like grip that EA now has on the title is another downside. I would say, stay away from this one. Sim City 4 is much better. It's years after release and I'm still playing it."
1,extremely disappointed,"The Steamboy T1 is useless. First, it will not slide across the floor until the pads become really wet, and then the pads keep slipping off no matter how much I try to tighten them. It also does not clean as the ads say it will. I would have returned it for refund, but my husband threw the receipt away, so it sits in a corner of a closet. Big mistake!"
1,Buy a disc based mp3 player instead,"This product does not play mp3s. It has to convert them to ATRAC, which takes for ever, and eats of disk massive amounts of disk, since you now have copies of your songs in at least 2 different formats. The tranfer to device is reasonably fast over USB, but the conversion from mp3 to ATRAC is no where near as fast as ripping a CD.The disk format does not allow folders within folders, so you cannot group by artist and album.Also, the software has the concept of ""checking out"" music, so you cannot delete a song on the player without connecting to the original computer you used to download.I'm planning on returning this item ASAP, and getting a good Samsung mp3 player instead."
2,Excellent refutation of the new creationism,"In response to court rulings that the teaching of creationism in public school science classes is unconstitutional, creationists have tried to tone down the religious aspects of creationism. They have even given creationism a new name: the so-called 'intelligent design' (ID) hypothesis. In TOWER OF BABEL, Robert T. Pennock refutes ID'ers and shows that creationism still has no business in a science classroom. In particular, Pennock provides a devastating refutation of the misguided arguments of Phillip Johnson, one of the leaders of the ID movement. Highly recommended."
2,Great variety of styles. Thoroughly enjoy the CD.,Great combination of differenty styles and artists. Picked this CD up on a whim in a Japanese guitar store and have not been dissapointed at all. Almost completely acoustic guitar...no overwhelming orchetra.
1,"Fettuccini shape, inedible texture and taste.","I can't believe this was made and packaged for human consumption. I am still reeling from my attempt at eating it- spare yourself.Open the package and breath in the heady scent of... ammonia. But wait, they warn you of the authentic scent of Shirataki, and recommend that you parbroil the noodles to reduce the stench, excuse me, aroma.Once cooked you can enjoy pseudonoodles with the scent and consistancy of overcooked squid. Mmmm, so difficult to chew.Described as the perfect diet food for good reason. You won't be able to finish more than two forkfulls."
2,Colourful,"Juju Vail has great artistic flair & there are many innovative designs here, all in full colour with templates for some (which happened to be my least favourite designs!). Biggest bugbear - every design is followed by the same, identical instructions on how to back & finish your rug. Once would have been enough, & left more room for the designs & photos. But the ""how to's"" of rag rugs are all here - easy to follow instructions for cutting the rags, hooking, braiding, prodding, even felting. A great springboard for creativity - pity about all the duplication!"
2,Carter Family Album,It is an outstanding collection. You have this one you have it all records and photos of the Carter Family.
2,Great Product,This thing works great and is a reasonable value for those wanting to do more than just grinding or cutting metal.
2,Excellent Option,This is a superior backup battery unit. and the seller was quick in shipping and processing... excellent experience.
2,The Return of Art Rock,"These Scottish lads sound like the descendents of David Byrne and the Talking Heads to me - and I like it! It is nice to have something to combat the doldrums of the ""Nickelback Era"" where many of the current crop of largely interchangeable modern rock bands seem to struggle to find some personality. This is a great album, and highly suggested summer listening!"
2,Pilare The Vampire is an astonishing read!!!!!,"I read this book on the request on my friend. I have to say I was very impressed. It is uniquely written and does not fall in the norm of old vampire novel's I have read in the past. The combat and battles in the book are magnificent. When I heard first about the wolf scene, which was friend could not stop talking about it seemed that it would not be so real and kind of too supernatural for this young girl to do what she did. But I was greatly surprised. That scene deserves a 10 alone. I was caught from the scene with her sister. Did not expect that in a vampire novel. This book is full of surprises and twists and seductive, and impressive characters. I highly recommend anyone that loves a great story backed up with intersting characters, especially Pilare. you will love you,and at moments hate her. It caught my attention from start to finish. I look forward to reading more from this author."
2,great product,I love that it has measurement guides along the side and in the middle. This cutting board is also great for cutting meat.
2,Excellent memories of a fine ladys' final days.,"This is a very telling story of a fine ship and a magnificent crew. Mr. Winslow gives a very personal account of his tour on the USS Houston, the events leading up to his posting and the battles that led to her ultimate demise. His honest gut feelings toward his shipmates and superiors give a very accurate account of what the officers and men of the Asiatic Fleet went through during the early days of WWII when the Asiatic Fleet was the only hedge against the Japanese expansion. I am pleased to recommend this book highly to anyone who has an interest in this period of history."
2,totally addictive,Ever since stumbling across this series I have been totally immersed in the Malazan world. The characters are beautifully crafted and the story line well constructed. I find myself reading the next in the series to the detriment of other novels
2,Maori Magnifico,Absolutely a great find. I'm glad I grabbed this one. It has a lot of relevance to todays tatooes.
2,ESSENTIAL NIKON ITEM FOR YOUR67 MM LENS,"THIS IS A ITEM WHICH IN MY OPINION, IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE AND TO PROTECT YOUR EXPENSIVE NIKON GLASS"
1,No mention of Saddam's deadly Anfal Campaign,"The one he committed against the Iraqi Kurds (killing 182,000 Kurds in just one year). The author talks of hundreds of Kurds getting killed by insurection forces in Iraq more recently with no mention of the much larger deadly campaign.On other matters the author refers to 1951 as the year of The Ten Commandments film starring Charlton Heston. Actually the Ten Commandments was released in 1956 and was made only after 1951.Back to Saddam she does mention him going to big war with Iran but tries to possibly blame the USA for the war. Ms. Rossi, Carter, the weakest president the uSA ever had (and one of the most pacifistic) was in office when Saddam started his war with Iran. Doubtful Carter could've stopped any war between the Middle East countries. Even more doubtful Carter's government caused it either. Saddam creepily mostly started that war on his own business (the rest of the blame fell to Khomeini of iran)."
1,This Man Needs To learn To Write,"This book was by far the most terrible book that is based on the Phantom of the Opera. This story is more based on Andrew Lloyd Webbeer's play than the original masterpiece. The story is terrible, it's a very slow moving book, and it's not worth buying!"
2,A Modern Day Storyville,"This is a great read, sensitively and accurately undertaken. There are few parallels to New Orleans' red light district but this one encompasses the heart and soul, a sort of experience in spirituality not undertaken for far too long."
2,Not so complete,"This ""kit"" is just a little book with some picture cards. There are other books out there that have much more information, along with the pictures.This is good to keep in a pocket or purse for general information."
2,Super horror from Hell!,Another Great in horror history! It is a new for horror genres. A must see as is its sequels none of which were let downs! A++++!!!!!
2,Tucano laptop briefcase,Macbook fits perfectly in the case. Easy to carry. Good for travelers. I love the color.
2,Great product,"This is the second type of oral irrigator I have purchased. The first one was an Oral B, had to be plugged in, and was inoperable after five months. I had a design flaw with the plug-in charge system which allowed the electrical connection to get wet and it became inoperable. The Panasonic is much more user friendly, and since it operates on batteries, is not a pain to have on the sink top. Most importantly, it works very well, has lots of energy to pulsate the water, and I love it!"
1,overpriced,just bought this product- 1 box of 200 count at local HEB store for $1.49. The price this company wants is a ripoff.
1,Awful waste of money!,"Actually, I wanted to give this 0 stars!I expected more from CNN - but as I listened to Larry King read off a bunch of credits for the first five minutes I knew that this video was going to be just a rehash of the original broadcast. I was expecting pictures without the CNN ""bug"" in the corner and dull commentary. We got poorly edited segments of festivities that should have been shown in full and long drawn out segments of stuff that should have been edited down. For example: With all the pyro that was going off around the globe, why did we have to suffer 3 whole minutes of various shots of the Hollywood sign all lit up with blue flashing lights? Overall, this DVD sucks. Let's hope that ABC has done a better job with their video."
1,Dead on arrival,"Orcon LB-C1500 Live Ladybugs, 1,500 Countall doa except for 3. Should be no stars unless you're looking for bird food."
2,Always a good read. Nice to have it on Kindle.,Good insights into Dickson's Dorsai series. A good read. I'm having fun rebuilding my old paper back Dorsai collection for my Kindle. Stories read well.
2,My review and thanks to the company...better late than never :),Within a day of receiving this item I determined that it would not work the way I needed it to. I contacted the company to begin the return process and they immediately sent out a full refund and told me to keep the item! WOW! Now that's customer service and then some!!! I will definitely buy from them again :)
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this book thinking that I might learn something after I read the glowing reviews by others. Believe me, don't waste your money. There is nothing here.I have purchased and own several properties so I am not exactly a novice investor, but am always looking for new ideas and techniques. There are no techniques, advice or even a motivational factor in this book that would make it worth the sales price. Two thumbs down!"
1,I was disappointed,"I absolutely love the K+D SESSIONS, so I bought this album hoping to have the same urban, ultra-cool listening experience. I was really disappointed. The K+D SESSIONS music is hip and smooth, and the transitions are terrific. Unfortunately, CONVERSIONS is too frenetic, too busy and fast for my enjoyment. Instead of chilling out I feel rattled and annoyed. I was not happy with this purchase."
2,The best of the best in children's books,"Of all of Iza's books that we've read, this is still our favorite. My 2 yr. old can sing the whole book. The illustrations are so eye-catching and the storyline so fun! This is a very, very talented woman!"
1,Blather,Nothing but a cheap attempt at capitalizing on successful books with opposite opinions.He must have spent a weekend doing the research.Very shallow.
2,Dancer's Illusion,"This series is intense, wonderful, and thrilling, but I NEED CLOSURE...PLEASE!!!! If I died tomorrow I wouldn't be at peace, not until this story-line is wrapped up."
1,Waiting for my refund...,"Purchased item on 6/30/08, received on July 4, 2008. Item was sharply bent in three large areas. I called Holsteins Home & Beyond as instructed to request return label, took me @ three business days to talk with a live person. Item was returned July 11, 2008. I called company on July 28, 2008 to verify receipt, the rep said they don't have a record of the item being returned...As of July 30, 2008 I have not received my credit for $31.12. The product itself was good quality but I will not order from this company again!!!"
2,Great effective medicine,"Ever since a bout with Cipro (a powerful antibiotic that probably killed off all my good bacteria along with the bad) 8 months ago, I have had problems with bloating, terrible gas, cramps, frequent bowel movements. I had tried other remedies and probiotics with little succcess. I decide to try this. The label said expect an effect in 7 days. After 2 days the gas, bloating and cramps were gone. I ate a tomato without feeling like I was going to blow up the next day. I can't say enough good things about this stuff."
2,A must see for anyone that uses computers,"Objective, authoriative and enlightening. What a story. A history of the personal computer industry that explains the humble beginings of such computing greats as Microsoft, Oracle, Apple, Gates, Ellison, Jobs and Wozniac. A great show to watch with the children. Educational, entertaining and just plain fun."
2,I love this movie!,"I was so excited to go pick this up at the post office today! I am a huge Kate Beckinsale fan, and this movie is so good! :) I wasn't able to find it in Walmart or Hastings, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon, I'd been wanting it for a while! Super excited!"
1,Not exactly,"There are lots of ideas in this book BUT1. They need to be updated. I've written my own version for this millenium.2. Do not take her chapter on law literally. With caller ID, you will be caught if you make abusive phone calls and she is hypocritical to say ""be sure you are right"" and then advocate property damage as a way of getting people's attention.YMMV"
2,The Village Poet and Collections of Writing,"I believe one of the most important element that the wise villager wanted us to understand was God,seek him first. The Village Poet wanted to let us know just how important life is with God. I believe that he is saying that you can have all the status, prestige, wealth, and power in the world but without God it is nothing. When it is all over there is only God and the judgement of whether you will have eternal life or not. He is telling us that no man or woman can make it without God thay may choose to but at the end they will fail. The Village Poet is wise about the knowledge of God and only wants you to be as well."
2,Sgt. Peppers Looney Cooks Club Band,"Phenomenal stuff! This album is like a dark and sarcastic Sgt. Peppers. The opening of the CD is especially like that. Les narrates the tales of classic characters that inspire fear, hate, pity, and love(sometimes all at once) such as the children of ""Mrs. Blaileen"", the seemingly perverted? Proffessor Nutbutter, good old Del Davis(who insures that 'There will be a bit more joy this holiday'with his tree farm), the characters of ""De Anza Jig"", Barrest Jefferies the tweeker and many others. I can relate to the characters in many ways good and bad and chances are you will too. The music is very dark, but it is still fun. The lyrics are dark too and there is that subtle effortless poetic simplicity that Claypool is the master of. Get it!"
2,Great Fun!,"Anything written by John Lennon is worth having - he was a gem. This is funny and caustic and enlightening, and will adorn any book shelf. I can also highly recommend ""A Spaniard In the Works"", which is my personal favourite, but hey, why not have both?"
2,Common sense chelation,AMALGAM ILLNESS is a book which which is useful to both the practioner and layperson alike. Dr. Cutler uses his background in chemistry to explain the rationale for chelating with small frequent doses and demonstrates why this is the safest approach to chelation therapy. I am a physician and am personally using his protocol on myself after my profession foolishly declared thimerosal-containing vaccines to be safe. It may be used for mercury poisoning from vaccines or from amalgams.
2,Last Waltz -- An Absolute Classic!,"By far, this is one of the best rock'n'roll movies ever made. Come on it's The Band! This film reminds me of every reason I love rock'n'roll so much! My best friend even modeled his hair after Rick Danko! There are tons of guest apperances, and memorable moments. There are also many hysterical quotes and one liners, that will leave you on the floor laughing. This is the type of film you watch with a few buddies and a few 12 packs of Strohs. Always a great time watching this amazing film. You'll never forget the first time you see this film, so why not make it soon? Absolutely of its time and timeless. (...)"
2,Genevieve Stamper Rocks This Boat!,"Genevieve Stamper is by far the funniest and most entertaining person I have had the pleasure to read. AT first, I bought this book for my little brother, but I started reading it and I couldn't stop! I COULD NOT STOP! I was reading until late late at night, like until 3:00 am in the morning. It was so easy to deliver these jokes to my little brother that I had him up all night too. Sometimes, now when I'm sitting at my desk at work, I think of these jokes and just start cracking up. When I'm sad, all I have to do is pull it off my shelf. Thank you Genevieve Stamper for your wonderful book, it has certainly lightened my life considerably and I recommend it with my whole heart to all those out there who love to laugh, need to laugh, or are just fascinted by today's technology. Wit, intellegence, and goofiness all in one!"
1,BOO,This game was a BIG dissapointment! My sister got this game for Christmas and she hasnt played it since the day after Christmas. Its very boring all you do is watch your cat and feed it. Sometimes you get jobs but not that often. While youre waiting to get a job all you do is watch your cat walk around. You can dress your cat but thats not fun because 10 seconds later it goes off. I dont like this game and i DONT recommend it to any one!
2,Akro-Mils 24 Drawer,"I like the Akro-Mils storage cabinet very much. I think it is well built and compares to other cabinets which I have from other brands. The only complaint I have is you are lead to believe that there is a drawer divider for every drawer and that is not true. Had I known that, I would have ordered dividers when ordering the cabinet. I ended up making my own out of aluminum.It would be nice if they told you exactly how many dividers you get in the description of the product."
1,Cliche Hollywood Tripe of almost the lowest order,"The acting was fine, the costumes were very good, as were many of the special effects, esp. the Cthuloid Long John Silver. The reason for the one star is that it seems the film makers were afraid to do anything unexpected (the great fight on the mill wheel was the only original thing besides the undead pirate make-up) I never once felt surprised or not know what would happen next.One of the biggest budget films in history based on solid marketing products, that came out before the movie. Sell out! What a stinker. Hollywood greed at its worst. They created the audience for the movie. At least the first movie, over rated as it was, had the innocence of no pre-marketing connections. And that one did have a few surprises.Booooo, I felt cheated out of the time I spent watching it."
1,MyoTape Body Tape Measure,Product was nice while it lasted problem was it didn't last maybe 2 months if that long before it broke. Wasn't happy at all with the quality of this product. It should have lasted longer.
1,Cute.... PAINFUL,I've never bled like I did with these shoes. I commute to work which consists of taking 2 trains to the city everyday. After about 15 minutes of walking I limped into the closest drug store to buy a box of band-aids to cover the cuts on both my feet. Never in my life have I ever experienced pain like that before with FLATS of all shoes. I immediately returned them that evening when I got home. Luckily I had an extra pair of shoes at work but the damage to my feet was done already. NEVER AGAIN will I buy her shoes.
1,Reading this book is cruel & unusual punishment,"I have been increasingly disappointed in Cornwell's more recent books (loved the earlier ones); Kay Scarpetta comes off as cold and humorless (What did Benton see in her anyway?), but this time Cornwell went way too far. Killing Benton off, and doing it in the gruesome way she did, was sadistic, cruel and unnecessary. Ditto, burning the stables and all those horses. The interesting thing about Scarpetta's work has been the investigation process itself. But why do the crimes themselves have to be so horrific? This is my last Cornwell book."
1,Wanted is no longer wanted here,Wanted is a collection of special effects in search of a plot. When it was over I wondered why I had bothered to sit through the whole thing.
2,Caillou,My godson really enjoys Caillou and the prompt delivery was a great lifesaver with these Caillou products.
2,"awesome, very handy tool","I recently lost one of these given to me on my birthday. I ordered another one almost immediately. It comes so handy on so many occasions: camping, opening boxes and letters, cutting, etc. I would always keep it as my key chain. Just remember to put it in your check-in luggage when you fly -- that is how I lost my previous one! Also, the knife is very sharp which is great, just have to be careful cutting stuff with it :)"
1,Original Ipod Headphones Earphones Nano / Photo / Mini,"I thought I was buying original ipod headphones by apple, but I didn't examine the details thoroughly enough. Even if they're not by Apple, they're surprisingly bad for its price. I think the $2.50 ones would be of similar quality to these that are $12.95.Once you plug the headphones into your ipod you have to tamper with the connection (the end that's plugged into the ipod) to get optimal sound. And the optimal sound isn't when it's plugged in all the way like it should be. You have to put it about 2mm from all the way to get the optimal sound. But the thing is, if you move at all, the sound gets distorted because the connection is bad, resulting in either a scratchy sound, sound from only one side, or fluctuating volume. It's definitely not something I'll use unless I'm sitting down. Even then, the quality is nothing like the real apple headphones."
1,Does not work on small pills,"I bought this to help my daughter swallow her daily medication: a small pill and a capsule. I put the pill on the shelf and as she lifted the cup to her lips the pill shifted and slipped through the slats and into the water. It started to dissolve immediately.She did not get the capsule down, either. Perhaps with more practice it will work but it's already been a frustrating journey."
2,Great foundational book for homeschoolers,"I am happy with the structure and content of this workbook and many of the other grade level books by this publisher; I used them in first and second grade with my son and plan to do the same with my daughter.I piece together my curriculum from lots of different sources, using this publisher as my primary source for geography, math, spelling and language. I will agree that there is some ""busy work"" that does not really help develop spelling skills, so we often skip those sections. I would also like a quarterly review/quiz activity to help reinforce things."
1,What a waste of money,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! Sorry, Mary, but unless you are a REAL die-hard fan of Mary Wilson, or of the Supremes, this DVD is a waste of money. I didn't even want to give it one star, but I was forced to give it a rating just to get this info to you. 22 minutes of Mary Wilson talking about stuff we've already heard or read about her and the Supremes. There are a couple of PARTIAL clips of the Supremes singing old tunes, but if you have other videos or DVDs of their performances, then this is no exceptional addition to your collection. Mary talks about herself being 63 years old and ""looking good"" for her age; the interviewer isn't that well-versed in the Supremes' history, so he is constantly referring to his notes; and each of them interrupt each other continuosly."
1,"Repetitious, Boring, Uber-Liberal Trash","I have a 45 minute commute to work every day, so I have been listening to these on audiobook. I quit the Anita Blake series after ""Micah"" because it seems Laurell K Hamilton gets distracted by whatever is going on in her own life and focuses the entire plot on her own corner of personal fantasy. These books are soaked in sex, but somehow she manages to make it completely BORING. Also, her vocabulary is incrediby limited. In 15 minutes of listening, the phrase ""my body"" or ""his body"" was used 53 times!!! Very distracting... Get back to the story, we want to actually hear a STORY, not about how a Fae are equal and wearing fur is bad.Also-WTF? Why does she create all of these strong male characters and have them all start CRYING??? Doyle CRYING??? SERIOUSLY??? I believe Ms. Hamilton has absolutely no knowledge of real men and is writing from a very ill-informed standpoint, besides having a fetish for giving oral sex."
2,Straight Talk to Men and Their Wives,"The title says this book contain ""straight talk,"" and it does. Dobson is right on the money in his description of our relationships in our marriage and our family of origin. This book helped to save my marriage. There are many aspects of this book that I believe are timeless. In every age we each must struggle to discover a path of selflessness rather than selfishness in order to develop the positive relationships we crave."
2,Very convenient and handy.,"this is a replacement for the one I bought about 5 years ago. this is a ""must"" if you use your Dremel tool - it makes the tool itself much more versatile and handy."
1,Short entertainment. Not worth the money,"This game is all packaging. The box itself is 3/4 full of air provided by a cardboard standoff inside. The clues are funny, but are severly limiting. This is definitely a game you can only play once maybe twice, because by that point, you'll have gone through and heard all the clue answers. And what's the point of playing a trivia game where you know all the answers? I'd say there's about $5 worth of clues in the game."
2,Great Therapy Game,I am a school psychologist and the children i see actually ask to play this therapy game. It's a good ice breaker to use with kids who have a hard time opening up or discussing feelings.
1,Broke after warrenty ran out cost to fix $150 same as new one!!!!,This camera was good until the warrenty ran out. It broke with a lens error and I shipped it to Casio (Time Machine) to repair...They sent a card back saying the repair would be $150.00 with shipping. The same as a new camera not to mention it cost me to ship it insured to them. I can have it back if I pay 15$ more for them to return the broken camera to me. So they get to keep it and they will repair it at cost so they can resell it to some poor unknowing person. I will not buy from Casio again.
2,A wonderful story,"I began reading Katherine V Forrest's mystery novels and I hate to admit... but I wasn't terribly impressed. Yet so many of my friends said she was one of their favorite authors. So I finally picked up ""An Emergence of Green"" and now she is also one of my favorite authors.This is a wonderfully touching story of how the friendship between two women blossom into something more. I highly recommend this book to anyone, gay or straight.It reads very fast, and I was on the edge of my seat through many chapters not wanting to wait to find out what happens next. The setting is a bit dated, but the story refreshing. You won't be disappointed"
2,Trimmer performance,"The trimmer seems to be well made and performs fairly well. Low noise level. Batteries do not last through half of the yard so time to allow recharge must be considered. The weight is easily handled, but the balance could be better. Positioning the trimmer for various cutting needs is difficult while holding the fail-safe button in the on position. The cutting line is supposed to auto feed, but is only so-so in that aspect. Overall rating would be six out of ten."
2,The Best of the Best,"Incredible!!! This book is the greatest book of Jude Deveraux I have read so far. I love the entire story very very much. Right from the very beginning, it captured my interest fully and not for even a moment I found it boring. The relationship of Gavin and Judith is so dramatic that it brings much joy to the reader at the end. I would recommend this book to everybody who loves romance and trust me, Jude Deveraux is the best romance writer!!! Thanks alot Jude :)"
1,dont waste your time with this guitar,ok if you honestly thought you would be able to buy a real fender strat for $200 bucks the you were completely wrong..This guitar is a Squire which is like a cheap brand that Fender own. You can pick up a squire at wallmart or target. A real American made Fender Stratocaster will cost you over a thousand dollars and you will have trouble finding them in most guitar stores. please dont even bother with this thing it is a worthless piece of junk. save up some money if your a beginner buy a samick guitar which is around the same price but is much better. Samick sells guitar parts to companys like gibson and fender and they are great if your a beginner. Anyway the point is this guiat sucks dont get it!
2,looking back,"Publish on Amazon Kindle with Kindle Direct PublishingI have not finished Orwell's book ""Animal Farm"". The reason being that when I got into the book I realized that I needed to review some history in order to appreciate the authors perspective. I knew that it was a satire of communism and socialism. However , which animal in the story represented which person I did not know for sure. I wont go into detail but to say that it must be a great book. I have heard about it all my life. I am anxious to get back to it. Theresa Jacobs"
1,Caution This Book May Not Be For You!,"This book only has limited value. Chapter 1 ""Know Your Flours and Their Alter Egos"" page 1 ""If you are dealing with a gluten allergy, a yeast allergy, or celiac disease ( an allergy to proteins in many grains), most of the flours and receipes in this book will not work for you. Nongluten baked goods are extremely difficult to produce. Consequently, most of our recipes call for gluten flours.""If you have an allergy to any of the above items, this book is not for you."
2,Should be read by everyone,"I do not have more info to add over the many good previous reviews except that this book should be read by every one who wants to figure out what is happening in the world.This is a small book that provides a brief view of Islamic history and ideas. For peple who are interested in a good understanding Islamic history and ideas you will have to look elsewhere. But if you want to find out why America is being attacked, you will find some answers here.The message I got from this book was Americans are hated by many Muslim because of what it is and what it represents. I am not sure it would apeace the American haters even if every Americans convert to Islam."
1,Just OK,"This was not what I expected, given the reviews. Haute Literature it's not, for sure, and I found the pace a bit tedious. Because I have so little time, and every chance I get to read is precious, I was annoyed at the conclusion of this book, as I realized that my time would have been better spent. I was never dying to read it, and I was insulted at the juvenile nature of some of the plot developments, particularly at the end."
2,"Nice, warm, and soft","These slippers are wonderful. Not only are they fun and funny, but they are very soft, warm and plush. I sleep in them, they are so comfortable."
2,With the Old Breed,"Great book if you are into historical war subject matter. This book is written from a soldier's point of view and is quite graphic in the battle coverage, and not for the faint of heart."
2,half the price of drug stores,"After being shocked at the price of these refills in the local drugstore I was glad to find them on Amazon for basically half the price. I bought two packages to take advantage of free shipping so it was like getting 6 heads for the price of 3. They were exactly what I needed for my Oral B Vitality Sonic toothbrush, Type 3709. They even arrived faster than expected."
1,Not up to George Winston's Standard of Excellence,"I was disappointed in this CD and have only played it once. There was nothing about the music that ""grabbed"" me or even made me identify with New Orleans jazz or blues. Not what I expected, but I was still happy to contribute to the hurricane relief effort."
2,knife,"this is a good knie set for anyone to have i gave it as a gift for my mother, i can guaranteed that anyone would like this set"
1,You get what you pay for.,"The car charger and wall charger work fine, but look cheap....which they are. The USB cord comes with a CD, but as many others have written....i can't get my computer to even read the CD. I wonder if it's just blank. Overall.... you get what you pay for."
1,A real disappointment.,"The CD that came with the book started with pronouncing the ABCs then went right into conversations as if the reader knew how to speak Spanish. I had to LOL. The sentences that the reader is to repeat are long and difficult to comprehend, especially since there was not a visual to follow, to try and pronounce the words correctly.It seems there should of been a chapter or chapters that worked collectively with the CD."
2,Beautiful Creation,"Shakespeare in Love is a wonderful story line of what may have happened in the genius playwright William Shakespeare's life as he penned many of his plays and sonnets. The movie is historically accurate as far as the time frame goes and even parallels what was happening with Shakespeare's contemporaries during this era. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I would highly recommend it, especially to Shakespeare fans."
1,Slow as mud. Don't buy for multimedia use.,"I purchased one of these about a year ago. The price for an 8MB Flash Drive looked like a fantastic deal at that time. The cliche ""You get what you pay for"" now comes to mind. I have owned at least six different USB drives over the last three years and this is by FAR the slowest of any of these many times over. 8MB is a lot of storage, but it takes FOREVER to write large files to this drive. I would strongly urge anyone considering this drive to spend the extra money for a faster high capacity drive if you will be copying large files to the drive on a regular basis. I regret trying to save money with this drive. It's really that slow."
2,That Baby Woke Me Up Again,This charming and delightful story tells of a common occurance in multi-children households. The whole family is involved with new siblings' night-time needs. The rhyming and happy text and matching illustrations tell the story in a way that will keep children reading over and over.
1,NOT HIS BEST WORK,"This cd was a big letdown for me b/c im a HUGE dre dog fan and i was kind of disappointed that the 2 best songs on the cd are from previous albums. I found that to be a sign of a lack of creativity and originality on Andre's part. Has a few decent tracks but nuthing thats gonna make u wanna throw this cd in more often then not. Could have been much better, and overall it was a big let down compared to previous albums."
2,Great simple uprade,"For those of us who have a fast reliable older computer, this is a great upgrade for geting video from your digital camera to your PC. I highly recommend it and it was so inexpensive. GET IT!"
2,The most amazing developmental toy,"This is the most amazing, wonderful developmental toy by Fisher Price. My 6-month old couldn't wait to play with it while I was assembeling it. It certainly keeps him busy for a while."
2,Good basic entry level study on prayer.,"This is a good entry level study into prayer. Easy to follow and prepare the lessons, leader guide provides additional insight. Opens the door to a better understanding of prayer in the Christian life."
1,Stupid....how did it even get produced?,"when this film came out back in 2000, i wisely read the reviews---not from just one critic, mind you; i like to get a wide view of opinions--and learned that this film was horribly created. having read those reviews, i stayed away from the film at the theatres. last night, while flipping through the channels, i noticed it on Showtime and was curious to see how terrible it really was. right from the beginning, i realized this was worse than the campy sci-fi films of the 50s. those you could at least laugh at. but this was just utterly horrendous. while i admire John Travolta's attempt to bring to the film a great book, one dear to his heart, why did he chose that director and cinematographer? what was up with those camera angles? why did we need to see Johnnie and co. from a 37 degree angle? what was wrong with just a straight angle? what was up with the terrible editing? in other words, HOW COULD IT EVEN BE PRODUCED?"
1,"Yawn... sorry , I fell asleep. very weak.","Music almost O.K., the band was boring to watch do the music. They did not perform the songs they just played them with the house lights all on.Band had big smiley faces. I have a suspision that they might be a ""christian"" band, and we all know what thats like. Skip this band and just get you some Moody Blues, or some Yes and you'll be alot better off."
2,Too soon to give 5 Stars,"The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is that I haven't owned them long enough to see spotting or cracking due to washing in a dish washer. I don't plan to machine wash, but accidents can happen. That aside, they look great, they have a great weight and feel when using, they are extremely sharp and I'm proud to have them on my counter top."
2,Nice Hat,"Excellent seller, recieved the hat quickly, and the hat is very nice. Only problem is that the dead symbol is slightly screwed up, in that it doesn't match up at the middle seam. basically, I have 1 and one quarter skulls and 3 eyes on it instead of 1 skull with 2 eyes. Furthermore, the price is a little steep. Otherwise, nice though."
2,Great game,I purchased this back in 1998 and of all the deer hunter games I liked this one the best. You don't need to have the disc in the computer to play it.I hunt deer in the real life and find this to be a easy way to capture that hunter realisiam. This disc came fast and worked flawlessly. I highly recomend this game to anyone who likes deer hunting
1,"Inability to fulfill orders, would not recommend","I ordered a tree to before Christmas, after patiently waiting, was finally told on 1/30 that there would be a delay until late March. Given other options I would recommend looking elsewhere, this company does not seem to have the ability to fulfill orders."
2,A good bottle to run with,"I've been using this bottle on every run I go on for the last 5 months. Anywhere from 5-15 mile runs. It is comfortable to carry, doesn't leak, and is easy to open and close. I am able to stuff 3 gels in the pocket with some cash. Alternately, I carry cash and my car key in the pocket. Sometimes it gets a little smelly, but you can easily remove the bottle holder and throw it in the washing machine. Only thing I can see that would make it better is that if it were insulated in some way. Since the bottle is in contact with your hand, cold water only stays cold about 20 minutes."
1,Get real - Really,"It's called bad poetry with an attitude. Put a constant, droning, hypnotic beat behind it and it will sell a million copies. And while 50 cent and Eminem and every other identical practitioner of the fine art of the mundane cliche, aka 'keeping it real,' continue with this drivel; fans of actual music understand the phenomenon for what it is. Namely, that rappers and their fans are terrified of standing out from the crowd, making originality of thought or expression a virtual impossibility."
2,Great product for a great price,"Great dishes, they have not gotten stained even though tomato and cheese have both been over cooked in them. Great having the lids for easy storage and helps when taking something over to a friends or families for a shared dish."
2,move over frank sinatra,Harry Connick Jr. was probably the most soothing music ive heard listened to. it would make a nice present or little party music.
2,big band classics are back!,"jaci, as stated in a personal interview, was trying to capture the 'big band' sound of classical christmas greats like bing crosby and andy williams. in my estimation, she succeeded, and then some.her vocals are full of richness and depth, her musical backgrounds ring with christmas cheer, and her involvement of the chipmunks inspired.i highly recommend this christmas album to anyone who loves good christmas music."
1,Not Celtic Bagpipes,"When I saw this title, I thought of Uilleann Pipes and the music of Davy Spillane, or perhaps a collection of something even more esoteric. Thinking that this would add a new dimension to my collection, I bought it without looking more closely. I should have read Don Robertson's review, as he nailed it. This is nothing more than another standard Scottish Highland Bagpipes recording, with a lie for a title. Caveat emptor!"
2,Great book,this is a wonderful book on the little know occurrence of the British shipping the Irish people as slaves to the west indies.
2,It's ok...,"The game's all right and everything. A bad thing about it is you can't save it and every time you die you have to start at the very beginning again and everything's exactly the same every time. And I don't know if it's my tv or what, but you can't shoot things at the end of the tv. If a guy pops up I have to hold the gun like an inch from the screen to shoot it."
2,A very good book.,My children have a really good tool to conceptualize space and the solar system. My son knew the names and order of the planets at 4 yrs old. My kids like to read and look at the transparencies on their own when I'm not reading them these books. We have several others of this series. This is a good way to introduce physical and natural science in a fun format.
1,Save yourself,"Don't buy this. Please, just don't do it. You may as well set fire to a 20 dollar bill or gouge your eyeballs out. Buy something worthy!"
2,Great Shadows performances,"Most (if not all) of the Shadows greatest hits and popular tunes are included in this concert. Some tunes are performed with Acoustic guitars (more jazzie). The Shadows are not really a singing group. The songs they sang were not too good (especially the Cliff Richard tunes). Overall, this is a must have DVD for Shadows Fans. I love this concert DVD."
1,Don't buy this if you're new to Pilates,"The only good part about this video was the short little workout in the middle. The beginning part was okay and necessary, but the ending stretching thing was stupid. I'd prefer it if there was more mat work in the video, actually now that I'm familiar with it I don't even watch the beginning or end of it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, it's dull."
2,There's that penguin again,"Adam Sandler is a comic genius. From lighting poo on his neighbors porch, to chasing an invisible penguin, this movie is hilarious. It is the story of a spoiled rich kid who goes back to school to win a bet and take over his father's hotel chain. Comedic mayhem ensues, and Adam gets by with a little help from his friends: Chris Farley, Steve Buscemi, and Norm MacDonald to name a few. This movie has a couple of jokes that kind of cross the line (minus a star), but is funny from beginning to end."
2,Won't drive you to the brink of psychosis,"Unlike most other children's music, Raffi is actually fairly tolerable for adults who have to hear each album over 40,000 times. It will not drive you to a psychotic state as will other kiddie favorites like a large purple thing which will remain nameless. Raffi's singing and playing are quite good--from an adult standpoint, he's a pleasant folksinger who sings children's material. He has a charm about him which really appeals to the children, which is lacking in something like the Jerry Garcia/David Grisman album for children. Raffi's sort of charm is not corny or overbearing, so adults will not want to run into the street screaming. All in all, he's the ideal artist if you have children under five and hope to keep a shred of your sanity, music--wise. For that I say, Thank God for Raffi!"
1,Worst movie I've seen in a long time!,Horrible writing. Don't waste your time. I had to turn it off half way through.
2,Quality issues with this Ravensburger,"Normally Ravensburger's puzzles are great in quality. We have a 35 piece Thomas one that's excellent. For some reason this 60 piece one wasn't as great. The pieces didn't stay together the way the 35 piece one did. The surface texture wasn't like the 35 piece one either, so maybe it was made in a different factory. The puzzle itself is of course great and the ""Thomas"" & """"theme are great, since my son loves both!"
1,more psycho-bable than anything else!,"This book loves to bash those suffering from MVP. After reading this book i am convinced that the author believes people with MVP are neurotic, immature and in need of therapy for the cardiac condition! Don't waste your money unless you want a laugh as this book is a joke."
2,Great Book..... BUT,"Hey, this book is one of the best, but I must say that to bring Kirk back to life again (kind of) is pretty stupid. I don't think Shatner should have included the borg in his reincarnation. He could have had them come into the picture later. I think the brainwash or something like that was a great idea. Even the going after Picard was a good idea. I love Kirk, I mean my e-mail address even has his middle name in it. It was a awesome book."
1,synoptic sadness,"This book is hard to understand, the author goes all over the place. A lot of it is the subject matter but wow what a confusing explanation of how to study the life of Jesus. If it wasn't required by my professor I wouldn't be reading it."
1,A big flop,"This DVD is awful. I had been waiting for this DVD for weeks and was really excited too see it. I was really disppointed when I found out that nothing new was on the DVD, just still pictures of Beyonce (all of which I already had). It's really unprofessionally done and just wrongfully stated at times. I will keep it only because I am such a fan of Beyonce's and I just hope that soon somebody will produce a DVD about her that's worth seeing. I cannot believe I spent 10 $ on this DVD. I recommend this only to the biggest fans who feel they have to own everything about Beyonce. But I will probably never watch it again. Not even worth 1 $."
1,Very little filter on reflection.,"the Circular Polarizer filter has very little filtering on reflections on glass, water or the sky, the UV filter I use as a lens protector and the other tinted filter has very little value on enhancement on light. I would not recomment this kit."
2,go!,"this is a great english debut and the included russian songs are even more fantastic. definitely check out, i predict they'll be huge within a few months!"
2,Classic Adventure Film,"In spite of an all start cast giving excellent performances, this fanciful, classic WW2 adventure pales in comparison with the book upon which it is based. Having read the novel first, I admit I was sorely disappointed by the film version. However, if you've only seen (and enjoyed) the movie, you will be in for a treat when you read the book!"
1,Low power,I live in NYC and there are a lot of radio stations and general RF interference.This FM transmitter seems to lack power and can't punchthrough on a channel where an existing radio station is present.
1,Old school,"Well I had heard about this book many times, and while I enjoyed it, it is a very old style of writing, and by the halfway point i had lost interest.If you like books like ""the razors edge"" then you will probably enjoy this otherwise move to a style more modern."
1,Poor Sound quality,"Don't be fooled! Just because it is a sony, does not mean it is the best! I found the quality of the padding to be poor, it was hard and uncomfortable on my ears. The inside of the headphones were made of felt and cardboard, hardly quality materials used for electronics. Sound quality was muffled. In my opinion the ones by Koss are better for a better price. I returned this one and got a KOSS UR-15C for the same price."
2,Great Resource!!,I am only a 1L but this book was recommended to me by a practicing attorney. This book is great for a more in depth analysis of topics and concepts discussed in class.
2,Life changing,"I met this book at a time when my life was at a cross-roads. My marriage was falling apart while my career was soaring. I realized that there was a huge disconnect between my apparent happiness at work and the malnourished soul within. I read this book in a period of 2-3 days, underlined key phrases, and went back to it during times of self-doubt, like many put their faith in religious texts.The first aggreement, Be impeccable with your word, is the most powerful one of them all. It has changed the way I conduct internal dialogue with myself and my relationships with friends, family, and even strangers. I have abandoned gossiping about others and taking pleasure in hearing scandolous stories. Now, I am more honest with myself and the world I live in. I am happy and fulfilled and this little book continues to inspire and guide me. A MUST READ! The only pre-requisite is that you have to be willing to change."
2,Hoping for a re-release!,"I watched this movie many, many times with my sons over the years. They are now 20 and 18, and STILL love this movie! I had a video which I taped from a tv showing several years ago, but it has been viewed so many times it is completely worn out. Please bring this lovely movie back - I'll purchase 2 copies on the spot - one for each of my sons to watch with their future children."
2,No 40something's record collection is complete w/out it.,"There is no denying that the man can't sing, but once you get past that, this album is the quintescential proof that he is a musical genius. It stands the test of time, I love it more now than I did in High School. (and how about that comic relief between tracks) I'm buying the CD so I can pitch the cassette and frame the vinyl."
2,My1Review,This item was perfect for my work cubicle. I had everyone asking me where did I purchase it..I said Amazon of course..
1,Too expensive for a single weight,"Though this item was exactly what I was looking for (the same that I used in Physical Therapy), the high price of $7.99 + $7.90 shipping was too much for just a single weight. I wrongly assumed I was purchasing a pair."
1,pretty but delicate,"this is a really pretty ring, but, since it is ""rolling"" type ring, the gems fall out quite easily. Also, there are two gold bands, and one silver band, instead of three different colored bands (gold, rose and silver, etc), which would have made more sense. The two gold, one silver just looks odd. I got a lot of compliments the first few days I had the ring, but after that the gems fell out, so, I don't wear it at all."
2,"Great sound, cool riffs, These guys rock.","Grinspoon is a great upcoming band. Their sound is awesome and the riffs are cool. Thier punk/thrash style is very contagious. These guys will definately make it. The CD is a bit too short, however Grinspoon is pretty impressive. I love thier style."
2,Awesome rumble.,"I have this installed on a 2005 Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. It has a 4.6L V-8 engine and these mufflers make it sound absolutely astonishing. I was worried that being their ""most aggressive muffler"" they would be too loud, but with the cats on it sounds wonderful. It is in no way annoying and when at idle, the sound is a wonderful deep rumble that you can only hear when behind the car. At wide open throttle, however, other know that you mean business. I would recommend these any day. I had plenty of aftermarket exhaust systems in the past, including much more expensive Borla stingers on my 03 Cobra and Corsa pace exhaust on my Z-06. These rank right up there sound wise and for the money they're a no-brainer."
1,Disappointing,"Has a very ugly face. Bought it as a gift for my Marine, and was too ashamed of it to give it.Will probably send it to school for a gift exchange."
1,Give me a break really!,"I'm listening to his ""I believe I can fly"" at the same time when I'm tpying this review, his voice drives everything out of my brain & I'm shivering at this moment. This song had become our company's theme song last year & now I want to resign already..... try listening to this song yourself..."
1,Beware when every five-star reviewer has only reviewed one book...,"...it's a virtual guarantee that the authors enlisted their friends and family to pump up their ratings.If you like self-conscious cuteness and obvious jokes that get old after the first few pages, this would be a great addition to your coffee table. Otherwise it's a great addition to your re-gifting box.Bonnie and Clyde full of bullet holes... oh, the originality! Oh, the hilarity! WhatEVER will they do with Dolly Parton?"
2,Best NAS product in the price range.,"This is the best NAS product I fund on the market in the $100-200 range.Great security design. Really similar with MS Windows sharing design. It supports everything at the user/share level, but not at the directory level. - I believe Linksys intended to do this. If you go to their higher-level NAS product, they support lot of more security functions. It supports long passwords with special characters.This device supports Chinese characters.The only issue I fund is the throughput. The highest I got is 25-28mbps for very large files. For regular size files, I only got 2-4mbps.The backup software user interface looks good but I did not test the functions - I don't use the function."
1,Broke fast,"Stopped working after less than a month.Prior version for smaller dog worked fine after 2 years, then again after battery replacement.This one died early. Battery replacement had no effect. Suspect Quality Control issues."
1,Take a tip from Morrie,"Take a tip from Morrie and go live your life rather than waste it on this horribly written book. To sum up the book...""I'm dying...this is what its like to die..dying...the end"". There is no substance to this book and nothing to learn. Nothing is learned from the dialogue and it makes me wonder if the author even learned anything from these Tuesdays sessions with Morrie. I grew tired very quickly of reading about Morrie talking about not talking about death. Save your time and your money by not reading this, and you will be living a better life."
1,Completely Pathetic and Not Funny At All,"This movie is a waste of time. While browsing for selections for my weekly video night, I came across this early 70's ""classic"". I got it and thought might be ok, because it was supposed to be more comedic than western. It wasn't.It was horrible. Terence Hill gives a mild performance as Trinity, but otherwise all this movie is a bunch of faux violence between Trinity, his brother and the marauding Mexicans."
1,"Heavy, too tight, and loses the connection..","I could not keep this on for very long. It was very tight and hurt my ear from the front and over the ear. It was also quite heavier than one I had like this before. You can't get more than 15 ft away from the phone, or you will lose the connection. I wouldn't recommend."
2,"Fun and Functional, but...","I really like the features and interface. I wasn't happy about the number of new software programs put on my computer and I didn't know what they were until it was finished.However, I had it less than 24 hours when the joystick broke. Honestly, it seems almost too light and flimsy to last very long. My camera has a joystick about the same size that is much more robust and has worked for almost 2 years. I'm getting the MP3 player replaced, but... that doesn't help when the joystick is still apparently quite flimsy."
1,"Lovely, but not Sutherland's best","Sorry, Sutherland is way off here. I'm sure I'll get a lot of insults for telling it as it is, but she is just awful here. For a great Prima Donna to admit that she's lost it, I know it's hard, but she has definitely lost it here. Check out her 1964 recording of Norma with the great Marilyn Horne, and you'll be greatly satisfied...buy this and you're heart will sinked. Sorry, I mean 2 stars only!"
1,Terrible film- and I am a Hrithik Roshan fan!,"Although Hrithik Roshan heads the cast and the film is in Hindi, I would say this film attempts to be an American story,and I don't respect many films coming out of Hollywood these days. Kites was terrible. I love Bollywood and other Indian film Industries, have watched hundreds of Indian films, and this is the worst I have ever taken the time to see. Violent, disheartening, and without value!"
1,Pern Gone Bad,"This book was a disaster. Todd McCaffrey should not be allowed to play in his mother's world, because it's really quite sad what he's doing to it. Even putting aside the various canon violations that he gleefully writes into existence (Don't even get me started on the whers...I almost cried), he's just not a very good writer. His characters aren't very empathetic or realistic, and it's difficult to get immersed into the world. He jumps around like crazy between characters and the plot (such as it is) is very stale and stolen from various incarnations of previous books in the series.I am 100% sure that if his mother wasn't the writer who created this wonderful world, he would have never been published. This book and all the other Pern books by Todd are nepotism at its worst. I thoroughly enjoyed all of Anne McCaffrey's Pern books, but as far as I am concerned the series died as soon the moment her son attempted to take it over."
1,dave matthews band is lame!,i hate this band! they wish they were as good as the spice girls.and who names a band dave matthews band. i dont make a band and name it andy lofaros band
1,wrong address,"sorry for this, but by a mistake i didn't change my address and it went to my old apt. what should i to?"
1,A very bad book!,"The concepts are presented in a chaotic manner, without small and clear samples. The book could have some value only for html programmers that just want to broaden their knowledge a little bit. ..."
1,OK sort of,This book had very few clip art designs that were of any use. The concentrated on some masks but no real designs. The other book had a CD in it and had all the same pictures too. This was a better investment. Wish I had known that before I wasted my money on both books. Neither were very good. Have several Dover clip art books and this was one of the most disappointing.
2,exactly as it should be,"This Norton waterstone is very good.If you have straight razors or good knives,this a must have.Came quick and was as described.Now i just need to get the 220/1000 combo & ill be set.Took away a star for price,kinda expensive but this is the best price i could find.Very good stone."
1,Christmas gift that came alive,"This was a christmas gift for a dear friend. It arrived well packed and as described...but then small flying bugs (gnats?) started to emerge, they have been coming alive for days now and nothing seems to stop them! Friend asked Amazon for an exchange...sorry no exchanges, if you return it we will refund the money!!! It was a gift!"
2,excellent refrence source,I had the pleasure (and panic) of being trained under Mrs. O'Connor herself at Yale before she retired. This lady knows her stuff and has a slide collection that's incredible. We use this book in my lab all the time. Great photos. Highly reccomend!
2,Great Fan if you want to move a lot of air,"This is a great fan for moving a lot of air. It is loud.I would have rated it a 5 but the plastic molded switch whichallows you to select off, 1, 2, or 3 broke apart on me. It stillworks. Just half of the plastic knob is gone.This knob falling apart did not stop me from buying another one."
1,Broken,"The shipment arrived within the number of days specified, but the packaging was insufficient. The candy arrived broken, some in quite small pieces."
2,Lodge Pro-Logic Pre-Seasoned 7-Quart Dutch Oven,"I like this Lodge Pro-Logic Pre-Seasoned 7-Quart Dutch Oven, and it complements my other Lodge Cast iron cookware . My oven arrived just days ago, via two day Amazon Prime, in excellent condition, and fortunately, I have not had any of the problems others say they have with this product."
2,Great series - everyone should read these!!,"This is a wonderful series of novels that any reader will enjoy and I'm thrilled about this latest edition. Even for those who don't normally read fantasy novels, give these a try, you won't regret it!!"
1,im very disapionted,ok i bought this violin thinking it was only about 60 or 70 dollars but i ended up paying almost 100 dollars including shipping wich was more than 30 dollars and the violin didnt come tell a week later and the worst of it is it was damaged i had to take it to the violin shop and cant play it for another week do not buy this violin even though it is a buetiful violin it isnt worth it unless you are willing to pay alot of money for a crappy violin
1,Much too fragile,Beautiful china but this(and many other pieces of Tracy Porter china)arrived at my home broken.Seems to be much too fragile for shipping and therefore probably too fragile to use.
1,"Terrible writing, silly story","Except for the first 5 or 10 pages, the book is a terrible read. Bradbury starts well but turns increasingly pretentious and obscure. From the third chapter on, there is at least two metaphors per paragraph, and quite a few of them are undecipherable."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"Promethea bad girl, ends world. Or does she? Her, and a backup, anyway, while she goes off on a mystical symbol-quest. This is pretty trippy stuff, and again, is not anywhere near the Hulk smash, Batman scare dodgy street crim school of superhero storytelling. So if you want straight action, rather than magic and mysticism loopiness, stay away."
1,Too much millet,"I purchased these suet cakes thinking they did not contain a large amount of millet seed as do the inexpensive cakes you can purchase at the big box stores. I didn't see millet listed in the description. On the cake wrapper it is listed as the second ingredient and once opened, you can see why. The label doesn't seem to say what kind of millet it is. White millet, in my experience, attracts pigeons and house sparrows. So far it has not been a hit with the woodpeckers in my backyard. I'm sorry to leave a negative review, but I do want to let others know what I found."
2,long .long,very long and would ot go up on son.i amvery short and go all t he way up onm e and feel good.
1,Ripped on first use,I purchased this for a standard sized hospital bed. It was barely long enough to fit over the mattress although the dimensions stated matched my mattress. I zipped it up and the pad immediately ripped along the zipper. Was expecting something that I could use more than once and be able to launder.
1,off the deep end,"I must admit, I bought this book because of the cover. Too bad I actually read it, too. It goes nowhere and not very fast. Why did Ham's wife hate Shoogey from the get-go? Who knows. Diane, why did you edit out Angie's pertinent character development? Diane?"
1,Defective Product,I have bought this product twice before with no issues. Received most recent package and when filters were installed one of the filters was defective and did not hold a seal and water leaked out. I returned the product back to amazon for a replacement and the same thing accord a second time. I finally decided to buy the product at sears (at twice the price) and both filters work perfectly.
1,Yet another ideological anti-family right wing work,"Hmmmmmm.....the Republican House Leader here says that the Minimum Wage is against the American family and should not be raised or even exist? Is he insane or what? He states that such basic labor laws as publicly funded Social Security are 'anti-family.' He says that we need a flat tax of 17% which would see the top rate on the wealthiest 2% fall by more than 50%. He favors privatization of Medicare, Social Security and various labor laws. He favors regressionin civil rights and the environment. He favors dismanteling all current gun laws, even those who ban AK-47's. This guy's crazy! This book is a pure looser by a pure looser and for a pure looser."
1,Horibble,"I got the phone and set it up with ease. To find that it needed a usb cable and software was unexpected and only complicates things. When you want to make a call you need your computer on and skype running. I had to set my skype settings and use the skype program in my computer to select who i wanted to call, And was unable to find my skype contacts in the phone to call someone. It made my computer and internet very slow and having a Quad Core, 4 Gig's of ram, etc this isn't normal. When i unplugged the device from my computer, everything sped back up again."
1,eyelits are bad,"These shoes are fantastic, I work on concrete and the shoe stands up very well, however, the eyelits on this particular pair are not allowing the strings to be pulled without damage to the lace itself. In the years that I plan on wearing these I will probably go through 10 or more pairs of strings! This particular lace pulls apart when it becomes blemished!!!Amazon needs to send out extra shoe laces if this is the type of product it is selling(seconds???)."
1,Was a fake perfume,This product was a fake perfume. I still have an original bottle with few drops... different fragrance and bottle.Didn't expect that Amazon LLC to sell such kind of products.
2,What's the Point of Not Having a Memory Card,"- A memory card is a 'MUST HAVE' for the PS2. I mean what's the point of playing a game without able to save where you left off. Without the memory card, you'll have to restart the game every time you restart the system, which will be really frustrating after a while. So my advice is to buy a memory card once you have the PS2."
1,Surveying Principles for Civil Engineers,"Do NOT waste your money. It is a good resource for school, but NOT for the PE Exam. There were plenty of mistakes and bad assumptions and it does not cover what is actually on the test."
1,couldn't even finish it,"I'm a big fan of John Grisham early works... Runaway Jury, Time to Kill etc. But this story and The Summons sucked. I read the The Summons all the way through and I never felt the suspense and after I got to the ending I felt stupid for forcing myself through the book. This story I decided not to even finish. The stories susposed to be about a man coming back and killing the jurors after he gets out of the jail. So I'm thinking that theres going to be about a 100 or so pages leading up to the man getting out of jail then there would be the killings. I got over halfway through the book which was very boring and I was still reading about the time surrounding the trial. I couldn't figure out the point of all this extra info. So I gave up. Don't waste your time if you're a fan of the early John Grisham."
2,The LAST calculator you will ever need!,"I am an old (electrical engineer, graduation 1993) and new engineering student (just started a bioengineering program). The new v2.0 software that came out today (3/5/2010) makes this already awesome calculator even better! They have made the graphical user interface (GUI) more intuitive and have finally made the connectivity software 64-bit compatible with Windows 7 (64-bit)... I own both the TI-nspires (non-CAS and CAS) in order to be able to use the calculator on tests (some tests will not allow the CAS) and have to say that handheld tools have come a long way since using my HP-48GX for many years!"
2,Fun Aussie Cartoon,"I recieved a tape of Blinky Bill many years ago and decided to buy the set after visiting Australia this past year. This cartoon is very fun and light-hearted. However, my father thinks Blinky's voice cuts through walls. I guess it might be possible to find it irritating. My only problem with this set is that it plays the theme song only once at the beginning of the first episode, not even the beginning of each disc just disc one, and the closing song at the end of disc three. This can make it difficult to tell when an episode ends, but MOST episodes end with someone, usually Blinky Bill, saying 'extraordinary'. Some end with an iris out but most with extraordinary."
2,Yikes!,"Who writes the product descriptions? Jaco's last, never-released, often-bootlegged album is called Holiday for Pans, not Holiday for Paris! Pans meaning the steel pan drums which he liked to arrange for (his pal Othello Molineaux is a worldclass pans player). Jaco composed and arranged for Holiday on Pans, but didn't play a note (the bass parts are abortion-faux Jaco later tracked in by someone else), so the suits wouldn't put it out. Only one song, Good Morning Anya, was ever released officially (here). But based on that evidence, who wouldn't want to hear the rest of the record? This is the great lost album of jazz. Holiday for Pans."
1,Very complicated solution for a simple problem,It takes a fair amount of dexterity and practice to use this tool. It tends to roll over the edges of the stamps and may cause problems with the postal sorting machines. I spent a lot of time pressing the stamp edges down with my fingernail. I would not buy again. Look for one of the simple dispensers that holds the roll and the stamp peels into your fingers as you pull the backing strip. This device is too complex. It requires that the roller be positioned perfectly and the pressure on the handle is perfect.
2,Pleased with shirt,"I've never purchased a non-media item on Amazon before, but rushed there when I knew I had to get a shirt for my dad's Christmas gift. I couldn't stomach the mall in December and found what I wanted at Amazon for a great price. It arrived on time and I was pleased with the quality. I fine oxford pinpoint which fit him well. I think he was happy too."

1,It ruins my hair!!!!,"Oh my goodness, i dont know what's the buzz with Carol's Daughter products but I've tried their body scrub and body shouffle. They didn't smell good and didn't moisturize good. But I thought I'd try their leave in conditioner, seeing all the good reviews on their website.And now it's drying my hair so bad!!! My hair looks like a witch's hair now thanks a lot Carol and Lisa! What a complete waste of money!"
2,Best automotive book I've ever read,"This is the first book I've ever read that tells you ""WHY"" you are doing something and how each component is constructed in ""plain english"". Once you understand what each part is and more importantly, how each part connects to each other and how they work as a team. Better than any ASE test book, better than a Mitchell manual, this book starts from the basics and you learn how everything works from the inside out. Full of diagnostic tips you don't find in most books, telling you how to use the most simple of tools to test the electronic systems with ease and accuracy. THIS IS ONE SUPER BOOK FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO UNDERSTAND THE MODERN ELECTRONIC AUTOMOBILE WITHOUT A HARVARD DEGREE IN ELECTRONICS !"
2,This book was rather exhilirating,"I think that the book ""a Seperate Peace"" is a good book. It takes place in a setting similar to those of any school out in the country, which happen to have the priviledge of attending. The whole story is based around a relationship between the two main characters, Gene anf Finny, and there athletic and mental pursuits to out do each other. It is a good book, with lots of symbolism; a good book for anyone looking for a book about a relationship."
1,What is this?,I must admit I was left scratching my head. On every Ripps cd (even Wildcard and Let it Ripp) there are at least a few tracks I like. This is one of the few cds I dislike from start to finish. I listened to it twice. Once after I purchased it in 2003 and once earlier this year. I've yet to put it back in the cd player.
1,Absolutely Awful,"Looking back on the days when me and me chums watched pokemon, I realise how mentally sick we all were. The show is pathetic. Its about a series of random 'adventures' in a 'pokemon' 'world'. ahem. These episodes hardly tie in together at all, with the same scenario repeated in a thousand different ways. I would have thought that by episode ten million in series eight thousand that they would have given up, but oh no! There are still lots of weirdos out there. And to mister ""a veiwer"", what you wrote isnt a review, it's a monstrously overworded synopsis."
1,Very disappointing!,"I certainly hope Nelson Demille is not turning into another novel machine, although it would appear otherwise. His last two efforts have left me wondering why I bothered to read them. Plum Island has its fun moments, but mostly I found it to be a silly, predictable novel. The main character of the story, John Corey, comes across as a chauvinistic smart aleck. Occasionally his humor is well placed and sparks a laugh, but mostly he comes across as a wisecracking, sarcastic know it all. The story is far fetched, and the characters lack depth. I think what makes this novel even more disappointing is knowing Mr. DeMille can and has written far better"
2,Strong Southern Woman,"Louisa Dixon welcomes us to the continuing saga of Laura Owen and her struggles as Commissioner of Public Safety and the Highway Patrol. A fast paced, easy read, Outside Chance, explores southern politics at its worst. Owen,trying to balance, single motherhood, a high stress career, and a life, confronts the crooked and dangerous side of state politics. Very hard to put down."
1,Avoid this one like the plague,"I was very disappointed in this device. I purchased one in Dec. 2001. Dispite claims to the contrary, you cannot change the batteries without wiping the system! This means you must then sync the e book with your PC and download everything again. Battery life is a miserable 7-10 days, even if you don't use the thing. It just sucks the life out of the batteries. The e book is basically unsusable for any serious application. The screen is not especially clear, and the PDA functions are pretty bad. You'd be better off with any palm or Win CE based device."
1,DO NOT BUY THE LELLO GLATO MACHINE,"When it's working it's fine, but it rarely is working.I have owned this machine for approx. two years. In that time I may have used ta half dozen time and had the ""the churn motor"" once last year. This year when I decided to use itit would not churn even though I may have used it only twice since replacing it.Now I am stuck with a huge expensive appliance which is useless for churning ice cream.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY ITALIAN DESIGNED MACHINE ."
2,Outdoor Speakers,"I bought these based on the previous reviews. I am not disappointed. They were easy to mount and sound better than my older more expensive RCA's. They are loud enough and deep enough, they sound great."
1,Movies leaves questions,The movie never does explain the bed in the basement? & it does not explain who is seen by Abby sneaking around outside?Movie was going along fine but lacks in that it never substantiates the above two items & their signifigance to being seen in the 1st place.
2,"Arty, Poppy Punk","_Pink Flag_ is a collection of short, snappy rock songs. Some highlights: the menacing ""Reuters"", the catchy ""Three Girl Rhumba"", ""Surgeon's Girl"" which sounds wonderfully deranged, the very poppy ""Mannequin"", and ""12XU"" a true punk classic. Unfortunately, not every song is up to those standards, and I can't rate this quite as highly as _Chairs Missing_Although _Pink Flag_ is Wire's most straightforward punk rock album, the band's experimental leanings are already on display in some of the album's more interesting tracks - ""Reuters"", ""Strange"", and even ""12XU"" itself come to mind."
1,DO NOT BUY... MONKEYS COULD MAKE A BETTER GUN,"My friend and I both bought this gun. We both charged it for the recommended time and it never worked. I could throw BB's with my toes faster than this if the gun worked on a good day. In ten minutes only 1 BB came out of the barrel and it just rolled out. It doesn't work, 'nuff said. All it's good for now is to be my back scratcher. Buy a pack of bendy straws to shoot BB's, they will work better than this gun. Thank you for your time. Good night"
1,Boring,"I did not like this movie at all. Dont watch it. Also, the sound track isent Neil youngs best either."
1,DAB Nutrition Says...,"I talked with Dan at DAB Nutrition at their customer service #800-775-5713 and he blamed Amazon for a ""technical error"" mismatching the price of these diapers for ""ziplock bags"". He says it is Amazon's fault. He also said that they are ""working on it"". I asked what he meant by that and he said that they working ""on a mass e-mail"" to explain the problem. I told him that there are many angry customers on Amazon. He gave *no apology*.Amazon issue? DAB Nutrition issue? There is a massive blame game going on here, and I am not happy."
1,"Don't bother, unless you're married to Bill Gates","I bought this under the impression that it worked with Linux and the Mac. Though it didn't say so on the box, a friend had one and the drivers for Linux, Mac, and Windows were on the disk. I worked on setting it up in Linux for 4 days to no avail. When I tried to set it up on my roommate's G4 Powerbook I had many of the same problems as before. After 2 calls to IBlitzz, dealing with people who hadn't a clue, I was told that my issue was given Level 2 status and that someone would contact me the next day. Today I got an email saying that the BWU613B is not supported on the Mac."
2,Good Condition,When I received this item it was packaged decently and the condition of the casing was in good condition. When playing the DVD there were no problems with the DVD. I am satisfied with this item.
1,Waste of money,"Ridiculously overpriced, even for a textbook. There are actual mistakes littered throughout the book and the accompanying slides that were provided to the professor. The occasional error is understandable in a first edition, but by the 9th edition it's inexcusable.Yes, I am talking about the 9th edition rather than the 10th. Somehow after all these editions I don't think they've gone through and cleaned it up with the latest one.Maybe you think I'm just bitter because a new edition came out just in time for me to not be able to sell my 9th ed. back to the bookstore. Well, I won't deny that. But I will say that this is the first computer science textbook that I even tried to sell back."
1,The Manic Mind,"The premise of this book is good - the idea that Americans are drifting away from practicing imagination and original thought. However, the rambling, often fragmented arguments that White offers in this book don't effectively support the premise. Reading through the text was much like having a conversation with someone in the midst of the manic phase of a manic/depressive cycle. This topic is deep and complex: It deserves a thoughtfully considered analysis, not simply piles of obscure references, tangential rants and belabored (!!) criticisms.Worst of all, White asserts that those who don't agree with or understand his rambling fragments are proving his argument and therefore (surprise!) are clearly Middle Mind-ed. What a waste of time.I hope to see another author, a competent and thoughtful one, go after this topic, as I find it extremely interesting and relevant."
1,Lugosi Makes the Most of a Bad Situation,"Wally Brown and Alan Carney prove they are no Abbott and Costello in RKO's bizarre horror-comedy. The only saving grace of ""Zombies on Broadway"" (1945) remains Bela Lugosi as a truly mad scientist. When Bela is off-screen, the movie stumbles in the dark. A strange curio directed by the always-reliable Gordon Douglas."
2,The perfect male summer reading escape,"With so many authors aiming for your wife's interests, it's great to finally have a novel written for a male's summer reading enjoyment. The book is an excellent summer escape -- it will take you back to long ago times that still seem so near and will keep you hopeful about the future. If you're a fan of Greene's columns or you just want to feel better about life, then you have to read this book!"
2,A Treasure,"This little book is quietly becoming a major hit. Why?Because don Miguel touches our souls. He shares with us ancestral wisdom and truths. He writes elegantly and beautifully. He speaks of a life he knows of love, joy, and kindness.I have spent a little time with this man. He is a gift. So is this book. Treat yourself or anyone you love to this work."
2,"works well, but difficulty hooking up to computer","Mouse is comfortable to use, and I haven't had any problems with it so far. I did have some difficulty hooking it up to my computer, but once I figured out the problem it was all smooth sailing from there. It is my first wireless mouse, so I have nothing else to compare it to, but i definitely like it a lot better than my old mouse."
1,Mediocre at best...,Regarding the Leatherette edition: overpriced and of mediocre quality. There are many older versions out there that are far superior. Try snatching one of them at an antique bookstore or something. Or just go for the nice Folio edition.This 'leatherette' version is just fat and ugly.
1,screws don't fit anchors,"You do your measurements, drill 4 holes, stick 4 anchors in, only to find that the screws go right through the anchor."
1,"More story suspense, even fewer answers.","As with many of these shows, the first season started out pretty well. Frankly, they are exhausting potential topics for the format. The format, by the way, is about 40 minutes of suspense and less than 10 minutes of no answers. To make things worse, The History Channel/A&E are releasing only one half of a season this time (""Season 3, Volume 1""). They apparently have noted CBS/Paramount's marketing practice of DVD releasing. Half season sets cost the buyer more in the long run and generate more revenues. Watch these shows on TV and save your money. You probably won't watch them repeatedly anyway."
1,A Bit Dissappointed,"Bought the album based on others reviews. Hank Williams songs just aren't the same when sung by someone else. Newer renditions certainly sound better, quality wise, as opposed to an old scratchy vinyl. I guess I am just a purist and appreciate the originals as opposed to Bob Dylan or Keith Richards version."
2,Husgow tells us,"There's a traditional country flavor to this album that the title suggests, but Jubilee is about as far from the band's Nashville home as the Mississippi River is (half a state away). With Jubilee, Bonepony choose to leave the twang in and borrow pieces from points west.... roots-based music with a rock flair and a river's flow."
2,Love Jennifer Cruisie? Meet Viginia Swift!,"Swift has a witty, intelligent book here full of good laughs and very nice writing. The mystery is intriguing, the relationships real and the characters absorbing. Mustang Sally reminds me of myself, and friends, who have finally grown older but not totally ""up"" (to paraphrase Jimmy Buffett); wiser and more experienced but not dead to adventure and passion yet! If you like Jennifer Cruisie and Suzann Ledbetter, this book will appeal to you."
1,costume jewelry without style,"Zellweiger, like a dozen other 2nd-tier actresses feels compelled to act out the fantasy of a woman forced to live the life of extreme Orthodoxy. The characters in this movie are nothing but cookie-cutter charicatures of good and evil. The ending strains even the most fertile imagination as our creative, free-spirited heroine loses custody of her baby because she forgets to light Sabbath candles -- come on now!!"
1,not a good purchase,The Coby CD/Cassette Player that we bought worked for CDs but the cassette player made a loud humming noise that we were not happy with. We returned the unit.
2,Awesome Book,"Dear readers, This book is awesome!I liked this book because it teaches you a lesson to be kind to one another.The charactor Mr. Rawlin is as mean as he can be! He wasn`t ever really kind to his wife or anyone he met. That is why no one likes him!Buck and Tunes were the best charactors in the whole book! They lived in a tree for one or even two days including one night!!!"
1,HUGE strap and numbers fell off,"The strap that comes on this watch is HUGE. I bought it for my husband, and took all of the adjustment links out and it was still too big. And the metal piece which joins the strap was sitting on his bone. Not comfortable. After a month or so, number 9 fell off and got stuck under the second hand. The watch was completely useless after that as it jammed up the whole mechanism. So unfortunate as this watch is sooooo beautiful. Amazon handled a very prompt refund, so 5 stars for Amazon customer service!"
2,This is the best one yet!!!!,"This book is so wonderful. I am starting graduate school and a teacher, but I disregarded my homework and bedtime to finish it. Once you start reading, you just can't stop. Ms. Rowling is absolutely amazing. I can't wait to see what the future holds for Harry and company. I just wish I could be there too. Everyone, young and old, should read this book and the others too!"
1,Undersized,I purchased two pair of these sweatpants and tried them on upon receipt. Both pair are woefully undersized. I actually purchased one size larger than usual just in case and I should have bought at least two sizes larger. The pants are nicely done and no problems with the quality but both pair are going into my wife's gym bag and not mine.
2,Colorful and Soulful,"Brazilian percussionist Nana Vasconcelos may be best known to most readers for his work with Pat Metheny or perhaps from his collaboration with Don Cherry and the late Colin Walcott in the group Codona. Storytelling features him as a leader and composer in a remarkable recording that blends together many diverse musical textures and natural sounds that blend together into a bright, colorful, and soulful collection of Brazilian-inflected music with roots in Africa and beyond."
1,Over the Hill Gang,This copy of a vintage movie was so blurry you could not make out the faces of the actors. the sound track was buffled at best mostly unable to make out what they were saying...I've made better tapes! Total waste of money & I bet this was a bootleg tape !
1,Honest songs.,"When I bought ""Proud Words On A Dusty Shelf"" I was very much into Uriah Heep and Mr. Hensley was my man. I simply loved his songwriting in Uriah Heep. so when he made a solo album I was deligheted and surprised at the same time because the songwriting on ""Proud Words On A Dusty Shelf"" was so different form the stuff he was doing with Uriah Heep. I simply fell in love with this album because of it's honesty and simplicity. This album is my all time favorite. I'm actually lost for words here. ""THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. KEN HENSLEY"""
1,Disappointed to see all these comments,"I have many EA games (I am still playing NBA Live 2K4 daily) and i am disappointed to see that they have stooped to this level. Activation was a main hate of people when XP came out and for some unknown reason it looks like EA has followed suit.Dont these company realised that DRM annoys legitimate users?All it does is make people want to rage against the machine and use an illegal copy. I am sure that some trusty hacker out there is already coming up with a solution to fool the program. I do hope so, because i dont know if i would ever buy another EA game if this isnt stopped."
1,Good price but ...,"Spec wise this router does everything one needs it to do. However, actually getting it to work is another story. After spending several hours trying different configurations and an hour on the phone with tech support, I was told I had a bad router and should take it back to the store and get another one. I did just that and after an hour of trying to get this new one working I gave up. Other reviewers seemed to have had good luck getting this particular router up and running, however, I won't be buying another Linksys product anytime soon. The amount of time I spent trying to configure defective products far outweighed the cost of the product. I ended up getting a Netgeat RP114 router and within 15 minutes of opening the box, I had the router working with my cable modem and 3 pcs."
2,"Well made, I highly recommended.","I bought this glove to work and handle wood, tools, and do carpentry. This glove are very quality made, strong seams.Pro: You can feel the texture of your work with your fingers all the time.Cons: your hands can be sweaty in hot days."
1,Disappointing,"The premise of the book was exciting - experiencing the situation through Darcy's point of view, but quickly became disappointing. Although the book shows that people can change, it seems forced and loses its appeal about a third of the way through.It was also frustrating that Darcy never made the connection that her `soul mate' type feelings for Ethan that `she couldn't help' may have been the exact same feelings that Kate and Dex could have had for each other.Wouldn't recommend as a must read, would barely recommend as an `if you have time read'."
2,"A great, modern example of classic fantasy.","The Song of Ice and Fire series (better known as Game of Thrones, thanks to the HBO series) has been a recent highlight for me as a reading teacher. It is a great, mind-bending series that meshes knights in shining armor, lost magics, royal intrigue, and nefarious plots. The third book is no exception, bringing even more depth to an already awe-inspiring level of detail. More character information, more geography details, more political strategy - in short, more of everything there is to love about the series."
2,Intensity Meets The Explicit Lyrics,"There's no ""warm fuzzy"" feeling about this collection. You either love it or you hate it. It's not the Rock your parents grew up listening to. It's the type you might hide from your parents!! This sound is life ""smack in the mouth"" reality. Sully turns up the intensity of the lyrics as well as the volume. Some may find these lyrics offense. My view is they reflect everyday life. Get over it or get away from it!! Godsmack has attitude and it's definately reflected in the sound and lyrics. It's a different breed of Rock for a different breed of people. It's metaphysical Rock..!!"
2,Great Product,"I just purchased the IP Ipaq 5555 Pocket PC. It is an EXCELLENT tool to have. Very easy to learn... the next best thing to having a laptop, only easier to bring along with you. The memory and speed of this is far greater then any other handheld I have experienced. Thanks HP for another great product... now to find more accessories for it! :)"
2,saving private ryan is awesome realistic!,"very good quality, nice blu ray with great actors like Tom Hanks. Specialy the opening scene of 20 minutes!!! must buy!"
2,The first of 8 deluxe boxes,"Shame you can barely find this is in the metal encased box as it was originally released. Glad I snatched it up when it came out in 1997. This is the first RELEASED Columbia boxes that took from 1997 until 2007 to complete. Chronologically , it would be the 2nd box. Fabulous sound on this reissue. The people who put this entire series together did so with extreme care and meticulous detail.The music ? C'mon , it's MILES...put it in your shopping cart !"
2,The Last Mimzy,"The Last Mimzy was very interesting. Not what I expected but good. It kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. I purchased it for my grandchildren and the older ones (8-11) got into it more than the the younger ones (6-7). I felt it was just to deep for them. I needed to watch it several times before I caught everything that was going on in it and understood somethings. So when you watch it make sure you are not distracted or make sure you can watch it again.Over all a good movie if you like Sci-Fi and fantasy which I do. It is family oriented which is great but my husband isn't into movies like this one, so he wouldn't even watch he fell asleep because he was board with it. Oh well his loss!!"
1,Broken!,"Downloaded this to my Tivo (Premiere XL) last night and just went to watch it this morning. Audio and video are 20-30 seconds out of sync. Totally unwatchable. I can't comment on the actual content of the video because of this, and this does not necessarily reflect the other video formats."
2,A good foundation to build a programing powerhouse on.,I have been programming in C++ for two years on the college level and found this book to be good at building a foundation knowledge of the language that can be expanded on with other book. I am on day 15 and alread have a good start on a bussiness program.
2,Look No Further!,"What an amazing set of lights. I was hesitant to see how the chromed plastic stone guards would look, but they look outstanding. Super bright and excellent quality. Great directions, even for beginners, and a durable all-inclusive wiring harness. If you're trying to decide between a few sets of lights, buy these."
2,I Know What I Saw,"I don't buy many UFO related documentaries on DVD for the simple reason that after looking into the subject for over twenty years, I finally know enough to be able to sort most of the nonsense from the truth, and unfortunately many so called documentaries relating to this subject are either very shallow, or contain inordinate amounts of informational garbage, or both.I'm happy to say that ""I know what I saw"" is one of the better and more informative efforts on the market, and for those who are interested in learning more about the subject, I would highly recommend this particular title."
1,"Great at first, then went downhill fast","We purchased a new computer almost two years ago and the Canon S330 was packaged with it. We were very happy with it for the first year, then the print quality gradually diminished. In the last two months the quality went from ""ok"" to unreadable. I am now looking for a new printer - after reading the reviews and finding out that I'm not the only one with this problem, I will be going with a different manufacturer. It's a shame that electronics in this day and age are considered ""disposable"" and are designed to last only a couple of years."
1,Keeps getting darker,"Black Notice is the beginning of the dark period for Patricia Cornwell. Don't get me wrong, I love serial killer books, but her books keep getting darker and darker - depressing to read."
1,One star is one too many,"Ordered March 16th with two-day delivery. Arrived May 1st. Can't open the box if I plan to return it, which I do. However, extensive searches suggest this box has low gain and NO Windows Vista compatibility. Software functionality is limited. By the time one upgrades the software one might as well have gone with the 4x4 using ASIO but that requires third party drivers because M-Audio drivers are the pits."
1,huh,"After finishing this book I have decided to throw it in the trash and find a better reference with which to try to learn if Tesla was a ""genius"". The first book I have ever felt deserved such an honor. The information presented in the book is totally lacking in any technical detail with which one can determine if this guy Tesla was as stupid as it seems. Granted he may have started off strong with his AC motor inventions-as presented in the bok the rest seems like it was hocum-a conclusion that is based on Teslas apparent inability to finish any working models of his subsequent ""inventions"" as well as to get anybody to commit any money to their developement."
1,Do right and wrong matter?,"I found the anecdotes and analyses of the habits that hold people back to be very helpful, and it was fun to read. What troubled me was the low priority given to right and wrong. This came out especially in the description of the meritocrat (but in some others as well). In essence, their suggestion seemed to be that focusing on what's good, right or true can be detrimental in situations, and that this 'bad' habit should be overcome. It seemed a small step from something like: 'Your unwillingness to cheat will hold you back, so whatever it is that hinders your ability to cheat is something you need to get over'.I imagine the authors would say 'We're trying to give you objective advice on advancing your career, not to be your conscience.' But that doesn't sit well with me.The Jungian analysis at the end was not helpful.Again, I found the book entertaining and enlightening in many ways, but that conscience thing bothered me."
1,Stupid songs by a stupid band,"What's this guy on? Why so many a** licking reviews for Nightwish? Is this a member of the family that can't sing, write etc etc???I have heard this album and it is crap. Perhaps I should have been stoned when I first heard it. Then I would be able to harp on about how 'good' they are????!!!! To anybody who is thinking of buying, 3 words - SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,genetic manipulated society,"This is one of the most really SF-like Star Trek books in the series. I say this because in this books, next to the normal first contact episodes, the ever present klingon warriors, the torpedo's, the bantering between the 3 leading characters, in this book two interesting alien societies are sketched. Esspecially the strongly individualistic culture of geneticly manipulated humans, that have adopted themselfs to their tasks, their waterful environnement and their own wishes is fascinating."
1,You're better off standing....Not a good a value,I purchased this product for our shower and to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.For $50 you would expect this item to be of a higher quality than it actually is. The various tube sections do not fit together well and the generic hardware pieces make it difficult to assemble. I didn't feel confident in the construction of the item and the wood seat was poorly pre-assembled and an enormous amount of wood filler was used to fill in the gaps.I still gave it a shot and found that after several uses the tubes fill up with a tremendous amount of water and when it is moved release a nice black color that stains your shower or tub. It also wasn't very stable in our shower.I wound up returning this item to Target and received a refund for the item and not the shipping.If I had paid $10 - $15 for this item I may not have been as disappointed but would have still returned it..Please look elsewhere for a higher quality product.
1,Not a 400 mhz bus speed,"The bus speed is 333 on this board. I was misled and purchased one. I was planning to put a 3200+ processor in it, but now I am limited to a 3000+. I am very disappointed with the way this board was represented. False advertising."
1,"This does not work, do not every buy anything from seagate","The one thing hard drives are supposed to do, is to store files so they won't get lost. my computer has notified me that around half of my music, or 30 gigs, couldn't be rewritten to this stupid hard drive, that was working five days ago. it seems that it is now randomly deleting all my music, and my computer is now fine. but this is around the 10th time there's been a problem with it. I couldn't be more angry with this product. please please never buy anything seagate makes."
2,An Agnostic's Gospel Record,"For years I didn't understand Nick Cave. This is very hard for me to admit considering how much he means to me now, but unfortunately it is the truth. I bought several of his earlier albums over the years, and the howling vocal assault, the crashing pianos and gothic affectations were all lost on me, yet I could never bear to sell them. Thankfully some part of my subconscious kept my rash capitalistic impulses in check, because when this record came out everything fell into place.Some how this beautiful collection of dour love songs enabled me to make sense of the earlier works filled with a gloomy obsession with God, murder, the southern mystique. So this album is a world changer for me, it is filled with passionate songs about love, faith, and uncertainty that often make me cry. It remains one of my favorite records of recent memory, and so I am compelled lend my voice to the choir and give this already well-reviewed record my unassailable praise."
2,great 50's flick!,"like the blob, most 50's movies are corny and sci-fi-ish, this one is different! this actualy gave me the creeps, the demon is creepier than the movie it self!. Dont waste you're time to rent it, buy it!"
1,Defective,"+ Nice fit and finish, accessory cables etc.- Did not work with any of my 3.5 inch ATA hard drivesPerhaps this was a single bad apple? I returned it."
1,Too noisy,"This item has a great list of features packed into a reasonable price, so I decided to give it a try. After running it for about a week, I decided to return it because the noise factor was too irritating for me. On all speed settings the tower rattled and buzzed in an unexpected way. The fan inside seemed quiet and smooth, so all I could attribute it to is poor construction of the chassis, which was affected by vibration during operation."
1,100% Pure Garbage,"As I read, I wondered to myself whether or not the authors that contributed to this anthology were serious. This had to be the worst thing I have ever read. If I knew how to give it less than one star,I would. A friend previewed it for me over the phone and I was turned off then. He couldn't stop laughing and I couldn't stop shaking my head. I was mostly annoyed by Zane trying her hand at this. Her erotica isn't that great and here she is branching into new territory? This book was horrible, not horror. It is an insult to the Kings and Queens of Horror to add this book to their genre. Try again folks, and add some thought this time."
2,"Just Another ""B"" Movie!","This film is really good. I'm telling you its worth having it in your collection. Bob Hope, Gracie Allen, George Burns and Martha Raye is funny as usual. Betty Grable in this film dancing it up. She isn't her usual pin-up girl self but if you want to see the early years of her, this is it. This film is a good film to watch you can kind of see what the 30s and 40s were about, the music and dancing, they way they talked, the slang they used. Out of all the films, I think this if the film that will let you see the culture of the 30s and 40s, and how they were young and wild, not much has changed. Just different music and dancing. The songs in this movie are great, Martha Raye singing How D'Ja Like To Love Me, What A Rumba Does To Romance. Great Fun."
1,Book never arrived. Horrible service.,"I ordered this book in mid-April and received an estimated shipping date of up to May 17th. It never arrived and I was told to ""check my local post office"". I requested a refund and would not recommend this vendor."
2,Wonderful,"Thank god they left off the awful song which appears over the end credits because it would otherwise completely spoil the atmosphere created in this wonderful, almost impossibly poignant score by the great Georges Delerue. The fact that he died within two days of recording it makes it almost unbearably moving. Breathtaking."
2,talk about nostalgic...,"WOW. This book really takes me back. I'm 21 years old, and this is the first book i can remember reading as a very young child. It has stuck with me all these years, so that should speak for itself. I would reccomend this for any child wanting to explore the world outside their own little world."
1,"DON'T BE FOOLED, MADE IN CHINA","December 2012 , Now all Little Giant Ladders are made proudly in CHINA. Quality is down and BBB complaints are up. Company is soon to be out of business and unloading ladders for cheap. Good luck with the warranty."
2,One of her best,I really enjoyed this book. It has many twists and turns that keeps the reader in suspense. Again another good book by one of my favourite authors.
1,NOT MUCH HERE FOR SERIOUS STUDENTS,"LARGELY BIOGRAPHICAL IN NATURE, HOSTY DWELLS IN (TOO MUCH) DEPTH ON HIS PROBLEMS WITH THE HIERARCHY OF THE FBI. IN MY OPINION, THERE ARE POTENTIAL NUGGETS WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BUT WERE SHORT CHANGED IN HOSTY'S SELF DEFENSIVE NARRATIVE."
2,Best 5-cup rotary sifter,This is an excellent sifter. It doesn't have any markings for measuring with the sifter but I never use those anyway.
1,SO-SO CD By JOE the Artists,"I Think Joe could have done a better job as far as the song are concern on the CD AIN't Nothin' LIKE ME because From the last CD to this one I think it took about a year to record this one.What I,m trying to say is I,m a fan of Joe,s an I,m from his home town Columbus,GA I expected something with a lot more energy,drive,carizma.Maybe two or three song that would make ya get up on the dance floor and do the don thing know what I mean!But this CD don,t got it.(Sorry Joe)Maybe next time"
2,"este disco es ""EL DISCO""","simplemente el silencio , es la punta del iceberg del movimiento rockero en mexico, su melancolia, excelentes letras, musica bien ejecutada, plagado de clasicos, es el disco mas grande de CAIFANES, y una obra obligatoria para todo el que quiera adentrarse a la musica de esta banda, no leas esto mas y ve y compralo"
2,Great Stuff!,This stuff takes away stains and leaves a clean smell behind. I like this product far more than any other product I've tried.
2,Excellent graphics and a wide variety of options.,"'Legends of Wrestling' is a creatively designed game that brings back 'The good times' of wrestling.This game has terrific graphics and a strange, yet awesome 'Create a Superstar' screen.Glitches, such as stalling of time or graphic misplacements are rare and very minor. Not many wrestlers are available yet the 'Create a Superstar' menu fixes that.An incredibly wide variety of attacks are present in the game yet some are quite difficult to maneuver.Due to the blood and violence in this game, only children 11 years or older should play.Noting all of the positive features and VERY FEW negative features, I rate this game FOUR stars."
2,Very complete and informative but a bit dry.,"Wow, this is the first review I've written that I'm almost certain will never be read - but just in case, I would like to recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of medicine. The text reads just a bit dated and very positivist, this is still an excellent resource on all aspects of the history of medicine.Guthrie follows the trends and institutions that sustained medicine throughout history rather than following the typical biographical format. The chapters on Islamic medicine, military medicine and tropic diseases were especially interesting since these topics are generally given little space in other works.This book is ideal for someone looking to deepen a knowledge of medical history or for a very dedicated newcomer to the topic. For more general introductions to the history of medicine, I'd recommend Sherwin Nuland'sDoctors: The Biography of Medicineor F. Gonzalez-Crussi'sA Short History of Medicine (Modern Library Chronicles)."
1,National Hypnosis,"Oh please, would you Neoconservatives stop the lies that you and the liberals are political enemies. There will no meltdown of the liberal media because the conservatives DESPARATELY NEED the liberal media to survive to keep third party candidates off the ballot, and dupe the masses into believing that modern Liberalism and Conservatism are different political ideologies (they both came from the same philosophers, Hegel and Machiavelli). Writers such as Bozell, Liberal or Conservative are merely pawns of the Demopublican/Republicrat elitists. My suggestion is to read both Liberal and Conservative books and sort out the lies for yourself, don't just read one side."
2,"Uneven collection, but the high points are exceptional","Trying to bring so many different artists to cover so many different types of material is a tough project. This entry in the Red Hot... series isn't the best, but it has some of the brightest spots. Most of the best moments are near the end of the disc, especially Sinead O'Connor's ""Someone to Watch over Me"" and the atmospheric ""Bess You Is my Woman Now"" and ""A Foggy Day in London Town"". I use 'foggy' to put my kid to sleep."
2,Just plain good!,"I love the cereal on which these bars are based, so I wasn't surprised that these are also great. The only reason it doesn't get a ""5"" is so I don't water-down that rating by making everything I like a ""5."" Make no mistake - these are great, there's just not something to make the bar stand out in a class by itself. Perhaps if there was some way to increase some of the nutritional figures without using artificial vitamins, etc., that might do it, but it's still comparable nutritionally to a very good quality brown rice. You're likely to be very pleased."
1,Brew & Go keep GOIN!!,"I purchased the Brew & Go because I have limited counter space and why use it all up when I am the only one in the house who drinks coffee. Figured this was the perfect choice because of the size and the make, everyone knows Black & Decker is a good name but I was wrong!Yes it's quick, yes it's small but the coffee doesn't taste like coffee, doesn't even smell like coffee while its brewing. Very disappointed and now I am still searching for a good, small coffee maker!"
1,Might be good for outside...from afar,Not worth buying. Not worth storing even if it was free. Returned to Amazon with no hassles though. Shipping was fast as always.
2,All in good fun,"I have to wonder about people who think the Deputy Doo Doo character isn't anything but good, innocent fun. I pity the parent who can't enjoy a little potty humor with their kids. My kids laughed and laughed when Deputy Doo Doo made his transformation and I was delighted that they had the opportunity for such a good belly laugh. Thanks, Dav, for not listening to the humor-challenged among us."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I bought about three sets of these along with the base set to use on three floorboard heaters we have. These things are so cheap that they could not even stand up to the heat of the baseboard heater thereby negating the entire reason behind their intented use. Then you try and return them and just end up getting grief.
2,Anything to improve my knowledge,This has been very helpful in learning how to help my grandson who has Down Syndrome. I have shared this with many...
2,Great Pen,Love this works beautiful. Makes a great gift. Feels great on the hand. Got this pen as a replace for the same one I lost. Highly recommend.
1,A sophomoric attempt to produce great literature.,"It starts off as if it will be a gripping story and then it compltely drops the ball. Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" series was able to tie in philosophical concepts with an engaging plot and captivating characters. Hal Duncan's novel loses all intrigue quickly, leaving the majority of the story stale.Don't get me wrong: I actually enjoyed a lot of Duncan's concepts and imagery, hence I gave him 2 stars instead of just 1. Yet it takes more than just interesting ideas and gratuitous prose to create a novel. I am a fan of cyber-punk, hard science fiction, as well as dark fantasies, but Vellum misses the mark.Bottom line: Hal Duncan is trying too hard."
2,Big Names Salute Zeppelin,"Led Zeppelin really is one of the greatest legendary band in the world. They sold more albums than The Rolling Stones and Michael Jackson combined. They even have two of the biggest selling albums of all time. On this compliation popular names like Duran Duran, Sheryl Crow and Hootie & The Blowfish cover very popular Zep tunes. However nobody has done a cover od Zepplin's most popular tune Stairway to Heaven."
2,Another great installment,Another great set of stories set to music. Lucy's storytelling by song is beautiful and flows.
1,Doesn't work,"Downloaded the drivers, and it still doesn't work. At least it doesn't for windows seven. This thing is older than Windows XP. The back says ""will work with the NEWLY ANNOUNCED Windows XP"""
1,Not that good and doesn't capture the spirit of the PpGs,"This game isn't terrible, but neither is it very good. The levels are too big. Normally, that is not bad, but in this game each level looks so much alike one simply can't tell where one has been in the level. That means you keep Blossom going in circles, while in the real world you are thinking, ""Have I gone through here yet. I have, havn't I?"". The other problem is the spirit of the game itself. In Bad Mojo Jojo you have very limited flying power, limited laser eye beams, and you can be killed simply from landing in a pool of water. In the cartoon the Powerpuffs knock down buildings and kick major villain booty. Oh well, while the backgrounds were extremely repetitive the characters looked good. All in all, this game is only for fans of the show."
1,I bought it USED and it should have been for FREE!,"I bought this book used and it is horrible!! I agree with people who say he is arrogant, sarcastic and just out and out mean!! If he had been my husband oi.. I would have sent him packing at the first month of the first child. What an insensitive jerk! He talks about having kids as if its as bad as having your wisdom teeth removed.. Its not. Its a wonderful experience that can make a couple even closer. I am the mother of a four year old.. I was a single mom at first then met my husband.. we are planning to start trying in January.. This man and I use that term lightly who wrote this book.. was not meant to be a father or husband.. Please.. if you are a first time father.. DONT GET THIS BOOK!!"
2,Excellent Watch For the Money,"I have come to depend on this as the ""watch that won't die"". For very little investment it is accurate, waterproof (for showering, dishwashing, swimming, sailing, canoeing) and indestructable. I wear it without concern for its survival during all sorts of active work outdoors, and it has survived repeated abuse. I strongly recommend it, and will replace it (should I ever lose or destroy it) only with one just like it."
1,Missing booklet,"The price was good and the delivery was nice and fast but the dealer failed to send the watch booklet and warranty. As this watch is a supposedly a new watch it should have an appropriate booklet for the particular model. This will be the last time I use this dealer because they are careless and unprofessional. I would still like the booklet if you can get it for me. Thanks, siyatasha"
2,Typical Cooper,I'm a fan of Cooper and as such have enjoyed all of his works that I have read. The Pioneers is no exception
2,this really works,"I wont pretend that this device is more humane than posions or bug lights [though I suspect that it is, and also safer for humans]. Nonetheless, it really does work. I've installed the repeller in a small 5X6 bathroom. Recently I unplugged it by accident, and it was only the influx of bugs in the bathroom [there is an open window in there] that alerted me that the repeller had become undone. In other words, a silent, effective way to control pests."
1,Not a Keeper...,"The product description and features sound good, but it is not an especially good value.1. There is not sufficient weight in the base to keep the product from falling over from the weight of the handle.2. The wheels are hollow molded so they are easier to break and hence designed to fail.3. The height adjustor/edge guide is in very close proximity to the blade and not especially secure. If this ever loosened more it would be struck by the blade with might damage the motor.4. The motor is a sealed unit and there is no way to lubricated the motor bearings.5. The advertisement of use for relief cutting aroung base of trees is not exactly a genuine feature. Try cutting a circle in a piece of wood with a hand-held circular saw and you will understand what I mean.I would not buy again. Looks like was designed for use for a season or two tops."
1,Confusing information,"There are two publications with the same name, same publisher, same publication year. One is referred to as a paperback, and costs $12, while the other is referred to as hardcover, and costs $45. It is not clear from the description of these two documents how different they are - the paperback is actually a pamphlet, about 12 pages, a summary of the other, a several hundred page book. Choose which you want based on this information."
2,No need to buy the newer model,"This racquet is great for the price. There is no need to pay more than double for the newer version of the same racquet this older one works great. Great control, spin, and power."
1,Needed Frequent Repair,"I was happy with this product for the first 6 months or so (within warranty period). Then the chest strap stopped working. I changed the battery, but that didn't help and had to send to Timex for repair at a cost of $8. About six months later the chest strap stopped working again, but now the unit was out of the warranty period. I e-mailed Timex twice explaining the reoccuring problem, but received a standard reply both times. It would now cost $25 to return for repair. It's a reasonably-priced monitor, but if it doesn't work for more than a year and a half and cost almost as much to repair as the original purchase price, it's not worth it. I'm mostly disappointed in Timex for their stock replies and lack of customer service. I will not purchase another Timex heart monitor and would advise others the same."
1,BORING AND NOT FUN AT ALL,We rented this for Valentines Day= What a disappointment! It went from one depressing scene to another. Don't be fooled by the trailer!
1,to answer your question,The only song I wanted off the soundtrack was This is my world.That is the name of the song playing when they made love for the first time.
1,A one-song CD,"Most of the music on the CD is forgettable (possibly regrettable), and if not for ""Everybody is free"", the album would be a total loss. ""Everybody is free (to wear sunscreen)"" makes me think back to the unexpected popularity of ""Desiderata"" by Les Crane. Maybe the public really wants (and needs) good advice disguised as a catchy song. I know I stopped working on the yard and went in the house to hear it better when I heard it for the first time."
2,Works well,"Terry-cloth surface does a good job of gripping the socks. One ""finger"" of the aid was carelessly stitched so I am hoping it will last for a while instead of coming apart."
1,Very Bad.. Don't Buy It.,"You should only buy it if you want to see the othe three other scouts. Although, I am told there are guy scouts that change into girls. Curious to see what that is about."
1,"If you can get it for free, get it.","I received this shade for free when I bought other products from Babies R US.My windows in the back have a curved edge to them. You have to place the shade high on the window in the straight area. Well you miss the whole lower corner of the window. The sun shines in through this lower corner. When I tried to move the shade lower on the window I could not fully close the window.If you can get it for free, get it. Do not purchase this item.I just recently went out and purchased new shade for my car to cover the corner this shade misses."
2,Best book of its kind.,"Barry Braverman's Video Shooter is a nearly perfect introductory text for aspiring filmmakers. He finds precisely the right balance between hardcore technical information (frame rates, cadences, etc etc) and practical shooting advice. I've read a number of the competing texts, and nothing comes close to being this useful and comprehensive."
2,incredible music,I recall those days renting the(otherwise modest)film so many times just to listen to the soundtrack. Lucky I managed to find the cd years later and now I can see I have a capital in my hands. The titles music is unbeatable.
1,Should have known,This product for starters - once opened LEAKS!. The cleaning is mediocre. Not worth it. Thank god it was only a few bucks.
1,Are you people Crazy! Learn about Jesus from the Bible!,"Check your sources before you read!Contains many astounding revelations that support our faith, yet are not contained in the Bible or in any other sacred literature.This extraordinary work contains a day-by-day and frequently hour-by-hour account of the three years of the Public Life of Christ, actually witnessed in vision by one of the greatest mystics of the 18th century.Learn about Jesus from the Bible! Don't learn about Jesus from an 18th Century mystic!!!"
2,Wireless headset,"This is a great product. Comfortable to wear, clear sounding to both ends even in the car and easy to use. I have had at least 5 different headsets and this is the best one that I have come across.Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology"
2,Great fun!,"I really enjoyed this game. You can follow along with the storyline from the movie, and even play head-to-head or cooperative modes. When you get far enough along in the fight (after you've scored enough hits), you can whip out Bruce's nunchaku and start REALLY doing the damage to the bad guys. The moves are good, and easy to learn. The graphics aren't the best in the world, but we're dealing with the SNES here, so you have to cut them some slack. All in all, a lot of fun."
1,Not For The Beginner,"Normally I enjoy the Mastering X series of books. I've read several in the past. This book, however, is not for someone new to XSLT despite the author's claims. It is full of undefined or poorly defined jargon which confuses the new practitioneer. There is no CD included so prepare to type A LOT when trying the examples. I'd have given this book one star except for the fact that it does have a lot of information in it. Don't expect to ""Master"" XSLT by reading this book without some prior knowledge of the technology and especially the jargon."
2,Excellent game,This is a terrific game and my granddaughter loves it. She has learned quite a bit from it. It came thru in great shape as well.
2,If For NO other Reason......,"Buy is CD for 'Takin Another Man's Place'. The only thing that comes close to hearing Shaun do this song here is hearing her do it Live, Which goes WAY beyond my ability to describe in words. The whole CD, both of them, a just fabulous. Shaun takes this band to another place. Not back to the Lowell George days, no one can do that, but to a NEW high. And Richie's drumming is better than it's ever been. Check it out"
1,This is Crap!!!,"I purchased four boxes of this brand...I will be returning 3!! The one box I am forced to keep, I will need to add another layer plastic of some sorts! This product does not work well! The quality of the tape is a JOKE! The scotch tape my children use for their arts and crafts projects is at least 50% stronger. I am very disappointed in the results I have experienced and would not recommend this brand if it were to only option on the market. Just to make the plastic stick, I have had to use packaging tape! In the process of using the packaging tape, I have ripped the cheap plastic...an all around mess!! Do not waste your money on Frost!"
2,Right Questions are the answers,"This is a game that will help you practice, while you are having fun, to ask the right questions, to zero in on the answer and at the same time keeping tab of the progress. I believe it is the right questions that you ask that help you succeed in a game or in life.This is a game with a educational value that will enhance your creative thinking with a dose of fun.If you liked Pictionary you will love Questionary."
1,Workout DVD,"In my opinion there is not enough time between each workout segment to easily transition into the next move, and I'm afraid the whole DVD is a little too ""over excited"" to be able to watch over and over again, once a week would probably be enough to bear which sort of defeats the whole object."
2,Good little wireless card.,This card worked right out of the box. Just loaded the driver and away I went.
1,Bad Boys Sean Penn,"I only bought this movie because I wanted to see Isai Morales' performance, and he was very, very young, but as always, great. I can't stand Sean Penn, who is VERY overrated. I did not like the story and I wish I had not bought the movie. I don't intend to watch it again, so maybe I can find someone to give it to. DON'T BUY IT!"
2,GREAT GROUP HARMONY,I heard a few songs by the prisonaires on this radio show i listen to.Wanted to hear more of them.bought the C D. They're better thani thought they were.Just Walkin' in the Rain: The True Story of the Prisonaires: the Convict Pioneers of R & B and Rock & RollYou should also get the book.Fasinating story how Johnny Bragg gotwrongly convicted & sent to prison. He wrote songs & formed singinggroup. Wound up at Sun Recording Studio. Performed at the Governor'sMansion.
2,Much easier than the Oster $20 one...,"OK, so I'll keep this short. I can't speak for how long this will last, nor how long the Oster will last.(I borrowed the Cuisinart one and just bought the Oster one.)**This Cuisinart SmartStick is MUCH easier to use than the Oster one. Even if they both break after one year, it's worth paying the extra $15 for the Cuisinart because it handles so much better. The Oster one has WAY too much suction and it's like trying to ride a rodeo bull. The Cuisinart is SMOOTH and lighter weight.**"
1,"Buy if you like the artists, not just a fan of Dolly's songs","Why would anyone slow down 9 to 5 - the whole point of this song as lost. I do, however, like Shania's version of Coat of Many Colours. Perhaps my disappointment stems from the fact that Dolly has always been country and each of these artists completely ignored the root of these songs. I'm all for doing things in a new and unusual way - as long as you are making an improvement. I felt that some of the songs were done in a new and different way just for the sake of saying it was different, not necessarily better. I guess I am just a Dolly fan afterall."
2,Help is on the Way!,"Once again, Fiona Whitney's book comes to the rescue. I am currently involved in a school search for my son, and her book is so helpful in helping me sort through the mountains of information about private schools in LA. It allows someone to zero in on a few schools and also helped me realize a few new possibilities of which I had been previously unaware. The book feels very much like a insider's view-- which I really appreciate right now!"
1,A rushed-to-print rip-off of a book.,"This book was a real disappointment to me. The blurb and the included CD (advertised as containing utilities and white papers) persuaded me to buy it. The book has a rushed-to-print feel about it and could have benefited from tighter editing (e.g. it talks about the use of ""ATMs"" in networking--OK perhaps if you run a banking network!). Many of the figures are simply Powerpoint slides which look as though they were included to fill space. The CD only contains some vendor marketing presentations--no white papers, no utilities. I would have liked to see more about present and developing VoIP standards and competing technologies and less about the various underlying transports. The book could be more technical as well. In short, definitely not worth the price."
2,Converge - Petitioning the Empty Sky,"One of their best in my opinion, true, it does lose a little wind after the first two tracks (the Saddest Day and Forsaken), but over all shows a band focused in their metal influenced hardcore style."
1,minus a billion!,"this book is complete rubbish. I knew from the start what i stepped into, but, unlike a decent piece of literature this one is completely an absolutely not fitting for society, as it has nothing to teach the common person about reality and life. It is also in a terrible writing style. i agree and retract my statements, this should be taken off the cyber shelves of amazon.com."
1,Junk,I returned it after one day. It sucked up batteries superfast. At one point it killed my visor requiring a hard re-boot. I lost everything installed and had to start again.Major trouble finding a signal unless I was out in an open parking lot.I am waiting for the Magellan GPS for visor with the 10 hour battery life and external power source and optional car bracket
2,Texas Greatest Musicians,"Willie and Cindy are two of Texas' greatest musicians. Cindy is as obscure to today's public as Willie is famous, but the respect Willie shows for her work tells it all. Cindy passed on a few days after the CD was released, March 24, 2006, in Mexia, Texas.I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to this CD."
1,Boring,"I was so excited to read this book, but I just couldn't stay awake! With that said, the writing and history was amazing, it just lacked excitement. Every time I picked it up my eyes were closing within a couple pages. I finally just had to put it down for good after 106 pages and move on. I was trying to make it to atleast 200 pages to give it a fair chance, but just couldn't!"
1,The truth is told!,"This is the worst cd in my possesion. NOFX is one of my favorite bands and I was disapointed when I listened to this one. Every song sounded the same as the last, very bland. The poor equipment, lack of effort, and simple song lyrics contribute to the cd's quality. I was so happy when I heard that my younger brother had accidentally broken it and was going to pay me back."
2,Another masterpiece by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins!!,"Left Behind: The Kids 39, The Road to War is an awsome book. Anyone who reads this book would say that they couldn't stop turing the pages. It was captivating and the action never ended. The Road to War made me express every emotion know to man. I love this series. I would suggest the kids series and the adult series to any child or adult who is looking for a great Christian Fiction series. These books helped me develop a better relationship with Christ."
1,Poorly written,"4 aspect I will judge this story by, Story, Worldbuilding, Characterization and Emotional response.Story: 3 starsCharacterization:1 starWorldbuilding:3 starsEmotional response: 1 starsAdded note:I thought the book was actually weaker than the film, which as far as the prequel trilogy goes, was a first. This is partially due to Stover's irritating and rather immature style, he seems to cater to young adults in this book ( I wonder what his own, non-Starwars books are like) and partially because the movie was sublime and the best of all 6 Star Wars films."
1,"Bad at best, dangerous at worst..","The first thing that gave me a red flag on this item was that the directions and warnings were not translated correctly. Actually, it was so bad I could see a possible law suit, but will leave that alone.Second, the packaging had more of a feel of something you would get at a ""porn"" shop and not something actually packaged for women.Third, they were wrapped in a plastic covering which was almost impossible to get off.And last, I am a 36D and like to wear thin, cotton bras and even though I have small nipples I always seem to have ""my headlights on"". So I really wanted something so I would not always be giving a ""free show"". The petals did attach and stick properly, but even through my bra if I ""got cold"" I could still see the high beams. I am happy I didn't spend much on these. Very unhappy with them. My friend told me to try the ones they sell at Victoria's Secret, which I will.Would give zero stars if I could."
2,"Good book, but not for beginners who want to learn poker","Phil Hellmuth is my favorite player to watch, and since he's from my town I thought I'd read his book to hear his views on poker. I thought the book had a good mix of his first hand examples and poker strategy. Overall, a fun book with a pretty simple strategy for all types of players."
1,"Basic information, very repetitive.","I had to read this book for a graduate class I was taking in special education. This is the kind of book you read where you're starting to question if your child has emotional issues/scratching the surface. It got very boring/repetitive after a while....case study, after case study, after case study.Save yourself some time, just read the 1st chapter and the last 3 chapters of the book, and its basically like reading the book!"
1,Learned the Hard Way!!,"Read all reviews just listed and I can agree with each of them from experience! The first one I purchased was nothing but problems and after receiving the second replacement, it did work approx. 4 yrs. and then the control board went out. It is an expensive product and maintaining with parts is not cheap. I cannot see investing any more money in Bosch's AE125. In the long run, it does not save you on your electric bill considering the expense involved with parts and electricians! The concept is great if it was a good product. Will return to the old style water heater. I have already discouraged a relative from purchasing and do not understand how they are still in business with no improvement in their product."
2,"Her first-person exploration reveals a teaming, vivid world underfoot","Under Ground: How Creatures Of Mud And Dirt Shape Our World focuses on soil and the creatures which evolve from there to shape our lives: from worms in a Minnesota forest which are making the soil too rich for wildflowers to mud-dwelling animals on the ocean floor, and soil microbes affecting both wilderness areas and gardens. Her first-person exploration reveals a teaming, vivid world underfoot."
2,"Re: Review Titled ""Minor Errors""","Regarding the review titled ""Minor Errors"" found below. The reviewer cites tha Aztec use of seconds and minutes as a flaw that ruined his appreciation of this book. The passage the reviewer is referring to quotes the Spanish conquerers citing of minutes and seconds, not the ""main character"" as he states.Secondly the reference was made as part of a calculation to the measurements of time which the europeans of that time were certainly familiar.All in all great book! Don't let the previous misinformed review discourage you!This is an epic tale that pulls you into the Aztec (pre-conquistidor) world. One of the greatest early civilizations in history."
1,No it's about Money!!!,"Money is the only reason that movies like this, with tenuous links to the sub-par horror series anyway, they slap the ""Amityville"" name to any ""Haunted House"" story and we,yes even me, buy or rent them and keep this whole string awful films running. Very poor story!"
1,Don't,"OMG where do i start, first a big problen is that the battery conections are so bad it will most likely stop working after a little use. When i called about the connections and some of the other problems u see below, a chinees gentleman pick up who could hardly speak english and he gave me a sorry ass atitude when i complained. The sound, well it sounds like static all the time. You can still here ur music but the quality is awful!Even for 5 dallors its not worth it. I got it back when it was only 2 dallors, it was not worth that!!!! I ended up getting a different speaker. it was a prity penny but let me tell u what i got is soooooo much better. If ur looking for a speaker for an ipod or any type of musical divice with an aux line, get the SKULLCANDY PIPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SKULCANY is an amazing brand. I have never had a problem with the pipe and i have had it about three months. I have recomended it sooooo many times in those 3 months."
2,A good purchase.,"I had the three latest CDs by interpol. I had no idea this one was so good when I just picked up the cd. As a whole this one might be better than Antics and Our Love to Admire.Get it, and enjoy!"
2,Limited selection,"I travel a great deal and often I would leave a book at home rather than add the weight to my already overstuffed briefcase. So I'd be reduced to reading the airline magazines over and over. Kindle seemed to be an ideal solution -- lightweight, small, and LOTS of books.I've been using it for a couple of months now. It delivers pretty much as promised, except for my purposes I find the selection of books very limited. The last five I tried to purchase were not available. (These were titles in theology and spirituality, not exactly best sellers, but not arcane, either). Otherwise, the display the responsiveness, the quick downloads are all real advantages.I'm sure what's happening is that publishers don't want to get stuck with their hardcover stock so they won't offer books on Kindle.When I bought this I thought for sure it would be the future of books -- but since I've read all the negative feedback from publishers, I'm not so sure."
1,Good for awhile--but no reliability,"This was a terrific gadget--for a few months. It then died. While it seems to be charging OK (limitation: there's no charge light on the base, so you just hope for a positive mechanical connection), there just isn't enough oomph to get around even one can, at least most of the time, without major coaxing. The backup: open a drawer and use the old manual model. That appears the only reliable ""cordless"" device available.Black & Decker's quality on small appliances seems to have really gone down the tubes over the last few years. I'm replacing this with a corded model from West Bend; B&D; will never again darken my kitchen."
1,Brushpicks,"The brushpicks are a nice concept,but,after using one for 3 or 4 teeth, the pick would bend rendering it useless.Needless to say, I am very disappointed.Lois Fisher"
1,Want to lose your connection to the Internet? Then buy it!,"This software sucks. After the bloatware installs and Windows takes an extra 2 minutes to load, Norton Antivirus 2007 killed my Internet connection. I am not a newbie. I build sytems and can write software.The only way to solve the problem is to turn off the ""Internet Worm Protection"". This is pathetic. My parents would have thought their computer was dead forever.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEYI am going to dump this product and start using something free like AVG that doesn't cripple my system.AGAIN... TRY TURNING OFF THE INTERNET WORM PROTECTION WHEN YOU LOSE YOU INTERNET CONNECTION. Good luck... You will need it."
2,My Child's Favorite,"There are many children's books on the market today and as a parent, I am always on the lookout for something special, a book that grabs the imagination of my son and delights him in a magical way. This book, and Ms. Gomez' illustrations in particular, create a wonderful world of colors and creatures that my son has responded to in the most wonderful way. Through the Heart of the Jungle has become a instant favorite and one that I enjoy reading to him time after time. Do yourself and your child the greatest favor and add this book to your collection. You will both delight in the experience."
1,I thought I'd like this book better,"I found this book hard to read, as Ann Coulter is so angry that she isn't clear-sighted. Each time I read a few pages I put the book down, as her ire and hateful tone are hard to take in big doses. She makes some good points, but I can't stand the attitude."
1,"OK, but save your money","Bought this on a whim to add to the other grill accessories in the garage. Didn't really cook the potatoes quicker than before and was tough to clean. It does keep the spuds in place (as long as there aren't more than 4) where you can continue to brush them with melted butter, mmmmmmmm. Be sure to use non-stick spray (found that out the hard way). Save your money - wrap them in foil and throw them on."
2,Great Suction! Love it!,This is a high quality windshield mount! Much better than the one that came with my garmin. This mount is worth every penny. Highly recommended.
1,not sturdy,When used in a soda can you must come down fast and the side arms will bend if not perfectly aligned. It needs to be more sturdy and not bend.
2,"IMPORTANT BOOK FOR ADHD PARENTS, TEACHERS, FAMILIES, KIDS","I have read several books on ADHD since my grandsons were diagnosed and this is by far the most valuable. It helps me understand what they are experiencing at school, home, church and why they behave the way they do. It certainly motivates one to do everything possible to help them avoid being ""the little monster"" and discusses what worked in the author's case. I congratulate the author for sharing his powerful personal story."
2,Concise and fun for all,"Having recently moved to the US I decided to refresh my knowledge of local history. I got The Penguin History of the USA by Hugh BroganThe Penguin History of the USA: New editionwhich I recommend, but I also wanted something that would give me a quick overview so I decided to pick this one up. I was pleasantly surprised - it is concise, informative, well organized and fun. I have the Jan 2005 edition which covers everything until the Iraq war in 2003, apparently a big difference from the 1997 edition. Regardless of whether you're 15 or 50 give this book a try. I guarantee that you'll find an interesting fact you were unaware of (or had long forgotten) about US history."
2,Great Classic found Cheaper elsewhere,KL Homme is smooth and classy-smelling; there's no doubt about that. It's nicely blended and the quality of the ingredients seems high. The light oriental character is boldly presented. However I found the 2oz spray a little cheaper at thefragrancefactory.com
1,"Old fashioned ""You are under my power"" hypnosis","The only good thing about this book is the hypnotic discs that come with it. Other than that, this book is a joke. May as well have been written 100 years ago. Typical voodoo witch doctor hypnosis wherein the client doesn't have a clue what's being done to them. Don't waste your money. If you want to learn hypnosis, there's a few good books out there. This is not one of them."
2,Small Town Girl,"I especially loved reading this book about the twists and turns of passions between Kenny and Tess. It really makes you feel that you should always keep your eyes open for love because you never really know where it is going to come about. It was great reading this book, quick read yet very detailed in what happens!!!"
1,Few used and it is almost running out of ink,"I bought this product few weeks ago, almost not used and it is running out of ink."
2,VERY cool book if you want to learn how to be a stand up comic!,"I'm taking his one-day workshop so I bought the book to prepare for it-the book is very cool, down-to-earth, tells it like it is. It's more for 'intermediate' comedians who already have an idea about material but want to branch up and out to more than 'open mikes' or bringer shows.I recommend it to anyone who wants to make comedy a bigger part of their life."
2,Can be useful,"We bought this to help control our dogs' barking at other dogs or people outside . . . but then we moved and left the dogs at the house with our grown son. We've used the trainer a few times, and our smallest dog (11 lbs), a pekingnese/rat terrier mix HATES it and will immediately run away and quiet down. The larger dog (22 lbs), a Boston/rat terrier mix, doesn't seem to be affected by it as much, altho it seems to work a bit if we stand directly in front of him."
2,About A Boy And His Horse...,"While I have never seen the Eqqus on stage, I can still say that personally this is a powerful and moving movie. In a nut shell, it deals with religion and how our upbringing can destry our lives. I highly reccomend that everyone should see this movie again and agian...Each time I see the movie, I see more and more sybolism. You'll never look at horses the same way again."
1,Feathery Nuisance,CONS:1)the vest is thin.2)the feathers come out at the seams.PROS:1) the price2) the color (black/red)
1,Very disappointed,"My 5 year old daughter received this as a Xmas gift. We were very excited to use it but that feeling was soon deflated. The focus is horrible; it does not provide a clear picture, very blurry no matter how much you try to focus the projector. I do not recommend this product at all. If they fixed the focus issue; it would be a stellar product!"
1,WE NEED A SOCIALIST COUNTRY! FOR THE CHILDREN!,"Taxes are too low for those greedy rich, the poor need a big tax check NOT the rich! This Lady MUST get elected president. That way we can have a reely diverse country and get the rich to stop stealing money from the mouths of our babies. This book shows Mrs. Hillary will push for Justice for minorities and for getting the rich to pay their fair share so we can all live good lives. Read the book and VOTE FOR HILLARY. We need her reel bad and we need to get rid of these fat cat Republicans running the country now."
1,Pie in the sky,"I didn't enjoy trying to read this book. The beginning starts off like some cheesy infomercial. Maybe Tony wants to be on TV, but I wasn't buying it. Top the melodrama off with crazy ideas on what America is in relation to the world... different strokes for different folks."
2,Great Cooker!,"Got this cooker on sale for $40.00 with free shipping and I couldn't be happier with it. Cleans up easy, cooks fast, gets up to 425 degrees. There is plenty of room for 4 lrg. steaks, or 12 chicken thighs. The non-stick surface it excellent for grilling fish too. I use mine on a table outside. Just give it about 5 minutes to reach temp. and start cooking!"
1,"Great ideal but didn't last, poor quality","We had a similiar sprayer and loved the pump and long lasting spray, it worked for 2 plus years. Our local stores didn't have or plan to carry so turned to Amazon to find a replacement. Worked great for about 4 loads of liquids and then the valve within the sprayer part died. This is the exact same issue that happened on the older one. Two years of service before failure is acceptable but three uses, no way!"
2,pop/rock brilliance,"These guys are always going to live in the shadow of ""Jealousy"". It would be near impossible to write a better ,more perfect song. But, not impossible to write some that are just as good !This album is full of beautiful melodies,great harmonies,jangling guitars,and, i love it!!!This is pop/rock at it's best. It may have been recorded with a smaller budget than some of their other recordings, but,who cares .""Big Budget"" usually means ""Big Producer"" which always means,someone getting between the band and their music.I'm really glad that the Gin Blossoms are back.Now, if i could just convince them to come to Cairns(Australia)"
1,Piece of crap,When first plugged in it did not work. After jiggling with the cord if finally worked. Had to tape down the cord in a certain position to get it to stay on. Dont buy!
1,Talk About Boring,I heard a lot of good reviews of the book but when I picked up the book to read it boried me to death. The author goes from one story to another without even connecting them. First she writed about a guy grabbing Esperanza then after she starts another chapter with one of her friend getting married to a salesman. It doesn't make sense! The book is boring!
1,This book is all over the place without bad focus,"Don't waste the money this book is all over the place. One would have to thumb constantly back and forth to find information, every example starts you from the beginning, material is extremely redundant. And to add insult to injury where it is redundant different verb-age is used making you question what you have read in previous chapters, thus making you go back and double check what you have already read. Book also wastes a lot of space in pictures instead of straight forward instruction, many pages are wasted only showing one step of example, space waster. Case in-point, go to index and look up Transition, creating, not there, author runs on about editors and doesn't focus on getting to work immediately. I can't believe someone has taken an Apple product, something that's meant to be easy and simple to use, and created such a confusing guide to it."
1,Random size ball,"I bought two balls. One came as a 75cm ball. The other is a 65cm ball. Unless you want a random size ball, don't order this product."
2,Good Read but not Heitzmann's best,"Let me first preface this with the note that I read the entire book in the loadtimes of playing a video game and in the 1 minute b/f my computer gets up and running. That scattered bit reading might have something to do with my blah feeling of the book overall.There is very little action, hardly any suspense, though those are balanced by a few good twists.The romance is blah, the characters are fine...semi annoying but fine.She's a good writer, great even, but some of the dialogue had the distinctly ""eh-that was dumb"" feel to it.Is it a worthwhile buy? Depends on your tastes.Is it a worthwhile read? Yes, if you like the slow, meandering type romances."
1,Overheats like madddd,"Unfortunately this card overheated within 3 minutes of playing any recent game. Crysis, Call of Duty 4, even Heroes of Might and Magic. Returned for replacement, got another one and it lasted about 2 minutes longer. It didn't just lock up my computer, it shut it down completely. Also made crackling sounds come out of my speakers when I had headphones in."
1,STOPPED WORKING AFTER ONLY 3 DAYS!!!,IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IT JUST DOES NOT WORK....I MEAN THIS A CHEAP WATCH BUT STILL INVICTA QUALITY USED TO BE GOOD FOR ITS CHEAPEST WATCHESTOO..... I DONT KNOW PERSONALLY IM TIRED OF INVICTA'S DOWNGRADING QUALITY. LOOK FOR ANOTHER WATCH.
2,great family fun!,"My 3 year old daughter received this game as a birthday gift. The ages on the box indicate the game is for 3-6 year olds but my 8 year old son enjoys playing it for family game night. This is a good game to play when you are playing with children from various ages. My daughter gets to practice taking turns, her colors, matching skills and counting. Overall, a good family game."
1,just weird.,the only reason i watched this movie was because alexis bledel was in it. and that is the only reason i would ever watch this movie again.the whole plot that he made a movie about his life is just weird. he in a way embaerassed his ex-fiance by showing he didn't choose her. i personally liked katie (bledel) better than jill in the first place.and to top it all off the main character (reed fish) was just plain unlikeable. though alexis did a great job playing the town sweetheart getting dumped... i would next time just skip this movie and watch her in something better. don't waste your time on it.
1,Terrible for running,"I bought these earphones as a replacement for my usual wrap-around-the-back-of-the-head headphones that I work out in. After I began my jog outdoors , I began having difficulties immediately during the first minute. The earphones would constantly begin to loosen its grip on my ear no matter how securely I tried to wrap them around my ear or snugly place the bud inside. It was a very frustrating and disappointing experience for me. I would definitely not recommend this for anyone with ears on the smaller side, let alone use these earphones for running. Even with its reasonable price, I would rather have spent the $13 (including shipping) and put the money towards a pair of earphones that I could actually use during my workouts."
1,mixed feelings,"I love the show and the books but this game is so bad! the graphics are horrible the characters arent easy to control and its way too easy. If you want a good sabrina game get SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH : BRAT ATTACK , now thats a good game!"
1,Perhaps they should warn people when they change their ingredients...?,"In Nov/Dec of '09, Innova decided to change the ingredients in this particular line of food. No need to let your paying customers know. $400 worth of vet bills later, and a bout with pancreatitis (my dog of course), I realize it's this food that is causing the problems. They later confirmed in email that they did in fact change the ingredients; however, they did not confirm whether they would pay my vet bills.Not to mention, they also changed their guidelines recommending this food NOT be fed to large breed puppies, whereas it was previously fine.They tout themselves as some Natural, good for your dog, food, doubtful.AVOID"
1,Still waiting,I have been taking this product for about a month and still nothing. I have been hoping to become pregnant and when I found this product I thought for sure that it would help. After researching the product I finally ordered it and now I am still playing the waiting game. I can only hope that it actually starts to work and I become pregnant.
2,A great deal,"We have twin boys and the economy pack of pampers is the way to go for us. We like pampers more than the other brands (and we've been through most) because they are thinner, have a light fresh odor, and hold just as much without the blowouts. We were getting diapers from costco, but for the same price and the free shipping to our house its a great deal."
1,Not better than Vines--not even close.,"I was very excited to get this book. It was the first expository dictionary I purchased for my Bible study. I found it odd that even though Mounce had a big part in the ESV this book is sort of hitched to the NIV.Now that I have Vine's dictionary and the SUPERB and FABULOUS, Complete Word Study Dictionaries I find myself never looking at Mounce's dictionary at all. I have been flabbergasted at the words he chooses to leave out in the expository section. And the explanations are not always that enlightening. I love the ESV! But this book was a huge disappointment."
2,"I Know What You Did Last Summer, Oooh!","This book is really good, but the movie was better. It's a book that keeps you gripped right till the end.Less people get killed in the book, so that's a plus. The movie way scarier, but the sequel, ""I Still Know"", is supposed to be way scarier, at least according to what Love Hewitt (Julie James) said about the script (BB magasine)"
2,Fantastic,"If you are a Henson fan, or just of the Dark Crystal, this is a must have. Fantastic pictures, nice story in a big book. Some things you don't need to talk about, just buy and enjoy this lovely book."
2,Techno plus Retro Speed Racer,"Great album, capturing the high-speed excitement of Speed Racer. Brilliant homage to the TV series that started the whole anime craze. The big payoff is the ""Hardcore"" track, which adds a very funny element of some interesting, um, interaction between Speed and Trixie. Don't miss the punchline in the final 10 seconds."
1,Terrible,The color even started to come off!!!! What is that its so flimsy it unbelievable and notto mention it looks like it will break any second Not worth 1 penny AT ALL
2,Filters for my home humidifier.,They are what I needed and could not find in the store. I found them online and they came very quickly.
2,Decent sharpener,"This sharpener works fairly well. Its easy to use and doesn't take up much space. It doesn't make blades razor sharp but does a decent job. I've yet to find a simple sharpener that makes a razor sharp edge, if I did I would buy it."
1,Disappointing....,"This CD blows. That's all there is to it. I was expecting American Hi-Fi's second CD to evolve much like Incubus did in their second album, Make Yourself, but I was dead wrong. ""Flavor of the Week"" was just another bubble-gum punk song, and ""The Art of Losing"" is no different. Am I really supposed to believe that just because there's swearing in this album the band has grown up?? Gimme a break. This band should change its name to American Douchebags. Grow up, you little punks. Seriously. If you want to hear an amazing second album, go pick up Vs. by Pearl Jam or the aforementioned Make Yourself."
2,The Best Dictionary,"The American Heritage College Dictionary, Fourth Edition Deluxe is a very beneficial tool for college students. It helped me tremendously to succeed in my class on linguistics. I will also use this dictionary in the future to help in all educational areas. Overall, this is the best dictionary I have ever owned."
1,leak,"It doesn't leak at the beginning. After freeze and we try to warm the milk in hot water, it just leak. :-("
1,Disappointing,Im very disappointed we sit down to watch the movie and right in the middle of it it stops and that was it . Never had anything like this happen. Hope I can get my money back.
1,Dissapointing,"I've been using linux since 1995. So someone could say that I am not new to the subject. I do not have programming experience but I do know how to tweak a kernel, setup a web/ftp/telnet/dialup server on this wonderful OS. I do posess some experience on setting up an ISP Point of Presence and some experience in systems security. So, someone could say that didn't start using linux yesterday. My opinion is that this book gives linux a bad name. The reason for this is that most of the stuff reviewed in the book doesn't work. Furthermore don't even bother e-mailing anyone, should you encounter problem, because no-one is going to answer you. This includes the author. A dissapointment.P.S. Opinions are mine and mine only."
1,"Junk Science, may work, still junk science","it's a junk science.authors reasoning is utterly stupid! taste-calorie association?!!i returned the book after reading 2 chapters. this may work for some people, but i couldn't take author's quackery."
1,Tim Hawkins - I'm no rock star,"While I have always enjoyed Tim Hawkins, I was disappointed in this one. I felt that some of it was inappropriate as I watched it the first time with my age 9, 11 & 13 year old grandsons, I realized I will be previewing future T.H. shows before the kids see them. We'll stick to Full Range of Motion and look for another comic we can feel confidant in."
1,Amusingly Enough...,"If one takes the time to IMDB the authors name, one will find two movies listed - Blank Check and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot - amusingly enough... the latter won an award for -worst- screenplay. If you don't believe me, look it up yourself.The internet has given us such a glistening monolithic world of exploration to traverse - one only needs to type in the appropriate words."
1,Not memory foam,"We bought one of these toppers in December of 2011 and LOVED it! We just bought another one and it is not the same quality. We took it out of the box, left it for 24 hours and it had no memory foam capability. We are returning and looking for a new memory foam topper, so disappointing. Based on some other reviews of recent, I have to agree that they have reduced the quality of their product and it is not up to par. I do have to say though, Amazon is awesome about their return policy!"
2,Yay!,"This is a really fun cd! I like almost all of the songs. ""Reckless Abandon"" and ""Happy Holidays are kind of funny, but they get old fast. Over all, though, this cd is one of my favorites, ""Roller Coaster"" being my favorite song. This cd is full of energy and is great to listen to when you're trying to get ready in the morning, or when you get home from work (or school).Note to parents: Don't let your 8 year old listen to this. The subject matter and language are not appropriate."
2,great first cookbook,Gave this as a gift. Has lots of recipes and kitchen tips for non-cookers as well as seasoned vets. Nice quality hardcover edition with lots of details and pix. Great gift for your anyone who wants to learn how to cook or improve kitchen skills.
2,The Under Dog and Other Stories,"WOW ! What more can I say except that Agatha Christie is the worlds GREATEST mystery writer and with ""Hercule Poirot"" put in the story ,how could it possibly get any better.These stories absolutely ""ROCK"" !!! Pat Simmons"
1,Low budget throw-away!,I got this short film because I wanted to try out Amazon's video on demand on the cheap.That's just what I got. It is a story about a preacher with quite of bit of lust in his heart.Several of the women are very attractive with one blonde named Anne McDaniels who is quite spectacular.The film ends with a eighties MTV style video featuring a Tiffany look-a-like.
2,Finally!,"I've been trying to find a remote that I can control everything with and this works great. The only struggle I had was setting up my tv since it wasn't in the database. It works great, just the setup was a little longer than expected"
2,Great little bag,This is a really nice camera bag. With a little rearanging of the partitions it very nicely hold a canon xs with lens and room for two spare lens. It is nice looking in appearance and is the right size for I think most amateur photographers. With the quick release catches you can remove the camera with a lens attached and be shooting in about 10 secs or less so you don't miss a shot. Great for having in the car when you see a potential shot and need access to the camera quick. I highly recomend this camera bag for Canon EOS cameras.
2,Terrific HDTV recption with a little work,"This small indoor antenna did a good job tuning most nearby stations (in Los Angeles) while in my living room. The only drawback was that it needed to be about 5 feet off the ground, and be pointed directly eastward to get any reception. My solution was to put it in my attic and wow, I got incredible reception and channel stability instantly. I receive all available channels clearly. I ran aprox. 100 feet of cable with no signal loss problem. Before I put it in the attic I tried it on the roof with exceptional results, but it doesn't look like it could withstand the elements for long. If you need a small antenna this is the one."
1,simply tragic,Why Cher why why? this song is so bad it's not even funny. The lyrics are weak and the music is very very old sounding. The mixes if you can call them are weak and dull. This one is outta here folks. Avoid it is my edvice.
2,Highly recommended,"This is a great book. Even if the book isn't a traditional step-by-step book that guides you to finding the best stocks, it gives you an idea about how to relate and approach investment. Lynch isn't trying to be you teacher or professor in this book, it is more like he is a veteran sharing his own experiences. I have read it twice and really enjoy the story telling and humor, but also the insightful comments about the market and investment in general. Highly recommended."
1,not for novices,"unless you are able to know when ""oh no this is not right"", and what to do this recipes book is not for you. its worth the 50 cents i spent at the garage sale and not much more."
1,Midnight Clear is a bleak movie,"I didn't like this movie ! It was bleak humorless snd the simple acts of kindness at the end,didn't make this movie any better. Watch ""ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE"" and don't waste your time on this movie."
1,A True Bush apologist,"i watch fox news time to time at this guy i complete tool. God this and God that. WTF can you grow a backbone and disagree with your buddy RUSH every once in a while, Sean???"
2,You can almost see them---,"The wonderful music & lyrics, expertly performed by this talented and expressive cat, makes a soundtrack album so alive you can almost SEE them onstage! Unfortunately, the sound quality due to the recording capabilities of the time are less than perfect, but otherwise this is a fantastic collection of toe-tappers from one of the silliest, funniest examples of American Musical Theatre. No wonder Carol Burnett became a star!"
2,This is a fun one... that really works,"This is my first Tamilee video, and I am very happy with it. The moves are fun and really work your core, buns & thighs. Before purchasing the dvd I read that some of the reviewers thought it was too easy - I was skeptical at first but purchased it anyway. I agree that it CAN be easy if you do not put your all into it - if you really get into it and add tons of energy you WILL get a great workout. The moves are very energizing and FUN ~ my only tip is to not use this more than two times per week, because some of the moves are repetitious and you could get bored if you used this as your primary source for exercise. I love repetition, because this is how you get the quickest results - but I also like to mix and match vids every week to always make my week of exercise interesting and inspiring. Highly recommended!!!!"
1,"Horrible, except for fans of cheesy movies.",I rented this movie knowing that what I was about to watch was going to be very low budget and very non-impressive. My immature side talked me into watching this just so I could say to myself that I watched a movie with Nazi's on the moon that invaded Earth. ...And they did. And of course I was dissapointed in myself for spending the money on such a horribly done movie with a pathetic plot as the credits began to show at the end of the movie. When will I learn?
2,Gonna make an appointment anytime soon?,"OMG! This has got to be the most disturbing movie I have seen in a LONG time. I love it!Alan Phinestone is teetering on the edge of insanity. But after he catches his gorgeous wife Brooke messing around with the pool guy, it pushes him over the edge. He cuts his wife's tongue out, yanks out all of her teeth (with no painkillers, OUCH) and then starts in on his regular patients, in particular the cute little preteen who has been waiting for a long time to get her braces taken off.I refused to even THINK about going to a dentist for about 7 years after seeing this and there is still a few parts of it that I cannot watch to this day.Excellent!"
1,"Enough already, you're boring me!",You mean I can sit on my couch and listen to 4 cattie females whine and complain? And I'll pay you for this? That's all that needs to be said.
2,excellent for all levels,"I am not new to clay, but when I saw this book at a bead and button show, I had to have it. There are techniques that I had not seen before and the explanations/pictures/et cetera are so clear and concise that I could immediately grasp the concept! I also enjoyed Syndee's style of conveying her thoughts and ideas to the reader."
1,Maroon 5 - Songs About Jane,"Maroon 5 hit it big with their song This Love, which I admit, was a catchy tune and I did like it and sing along. However, their album is not very solid. They've got tracks that just seem really plain and like filler tracks. The other single which was Sunday Morning is a nice song. But their other single She Will Be Loved gets on my nerves. The lead singer has a high nasaly voice but it didn't bother me in some of the songs. But in that song and some others it does. So I can't really listen to this album for more than one rotation for example so it ends up sitting there in the corner. If you like She Will Be Loved (assuming you've heard it on the radio or something) then the album should be fine but for those that don't really enjoy his voice all that much this album isn't strong."
2,Work great for my Laptop,"I have a Toshiba A45-S150. This product works great, well design and looks like the original one. Excelente Quality."
2,One of the Greats!,This was one of the first short stories I read to improve my English when I arrived in the United States. It still grips me because of how well the main story is written!
2,Wonderful Purchase,"I love this bag (I use it mostly for school and classes I teach). It is large enough to hold my 17"" dell inspirion, my extra battery and the adapter to plug into the wall. I can also fit my wallet, pens, papers and books in the bag. Even with all of this stuff inside it is still very stylish. I am gettting compliments almost everytime I use it."
1,The bar may just be too high.,"I like books that don't require learning an imaginary language. Reading Sartre once was enough. I like books that don't require quantum leaps of logic. I like books that don't require a complete suspension of my system of disbelief. I like books that I that I can finish. I didn't like this book.Looking for philosophical business thought from science? See ""Leadership and the New Science: Discovering Order in a Chaotic World Revised"" by Margaret J. Wheatley"
2,Dazzling Diamonds,The diamond stud earrings are exactly what I hoped they would be when I ordered them. Extremely pleased!
2,No complaints,"I have to say that this is one of the better books I have read in a while. The Days of the French Revolution is well written and informative. It is a great book to read if you have read nothing on the French Revolution before and are looking to attain the basics about one of the most important events in history. The book does not overwhelm you with facts.If you want a book that is fun to read and gives you sufficient information on the French Revolution, I would strongly suggest this book. However, if you are well read into the Revolution and want a more detailed view you may want to look for something else."
1,great sound poor quality,Got these in May with pepsi points and today one side doesn't work. When they did work they were the best sounding earphones I've had. the earphone when not in use were put in the closet with the wire hanging down so the wire was never tangled no reason for them to break. if it wasn't for getting these through the pepsi points I would be alot madder than I am now.
2,"Great Audio and Video, mostly in Spanish",I guess I should have known that since this concert is in Miami that the concert would mostly be in spanish. That thought escaped me until I began watching the disc and I was unable to undertsand what she was singing. However with Shakira does it really matter if you can't understand the words? She is beautiful and the video is so clear!!
2,J.Mathis - 50th Anniversary Celebration,All my favorite Johnny Mathis songs. Very good and relaxing.
2,King & Country,"A Dirk Bogarde and Jospeph Losey film partnership (that also included The Servant, Modesty Blaze) gives this hard hitting, anti war film a thrilling edge missing from British Cinema of the time. Beautifully judged performances stand out against Losey's rat infested backdrop on the horrors of war."
1,Tony- Why,"Really - What is everyone else watching? What am I missing from this film that has everyone giving it rave reviews? this is one of the worst movies I have seen and I have seen some horrible movies. I can't believe that I wasted $2.99 on this instant video. It is a pretty close rip off of Dahmer, which was far superior film - 'Tony', is quite far from excellent or even acceptable."
2,Great pedometer,"I have bought several pedometers over the past few years but this is the only one that is accurate. I love it and wear it every day, even when I am not exercising."
2,Not the best book by Lurlene McDaniel but A good One,Telling Christana good-bye isn't the best book Lurlene has written. But it was very well written and i enjoyed reading it. I've read several of her books and by far the best one is Don't Die My Love i don't know how many times i cried in that book because i have a good guy freind that fought with cancer a year ago today. And sadly he didn't make it .
1,Ummm...,"One word, AWFUL!!!!!!!! Hilary Duff should be thrown in jail for thinking she can sing and act. Too bad she wasn't clapping and singing at the same time then you couldn't hear her singing :)only the flapping of her jubbly arms. She calims she helped write her lyrics, I believe that because her lines are corny like ""If you can't do the math get out of the equasion"".I recomend you highly not to waste money on this so-called number one cd in america (yeah right). Lets try to stop this girl from getting cocky, too late. Metamorphosis is horrible when I listened to it I wished I were deaf."
2,Excellent debut album by a great long gone west coast band,I feel sadness over the long ongoing feud between Matthew Katz and the band....it's truly unfortunate that this is all that represents an excellent album by a very influential west coast 60's band. Every song here was a keeper....they actually released 12 songs from this album in single format..they are very collectable...along with the paper jacketsThe first 2 albums by this band maintained the classic lineup..and the sound quality is fairly identical.....but very workable...read on.Here's a suggestion to those of you with discriminating ears:Invest in something like a Steinberger Clean software for about $99.00...you will be able to do some minor remastering to the overall sound...I used that same program to remaster some of my cd collection that I wasn't pleased with the sound quality. You might be pleased with the results.
1,Not really much help,"This book contains most of the scales, in every key, as well as most of the important chords to be used in jazz improvisation. What it doesn't contain is any guidance as to HOW to improvise successfully. While some might argue that improvisation, by definition, is something you make up yourself, I believe that a few examples would be very helpful to a beginner musician (after all, who else would want to buy this book?). Another thing, this book amazingly doesn't contain the Blues scale. Big mistake! In summing it up, I'd rather pay a few dollars more for something that lives up to its title."
1,"It Sounded Like a Good Idea...,","I bought this to hear Lesley Gore hear 'Dirty Deeds' and now I'm thinking I should have just tried to imagine it in my head. Like the previous comment, there's nothing really unusual about these covers so they don't even have that much of a 'so bad, they're good', or camp value. The covers are pretty unremarkable, bordering on boring. Oh well, live and learn."
2,Only a dog owner could understand This love story,"This book review could read like the classic Broadway play review, 'I laughed, I cried"". The journey that Jon Katz takes us on is a microcosm of life. The emotional energy he invests in his search to understand a difficult dog pays off for readers with dividends of colorful vignettes. One comes to know the personalities of the dogs as the year unfolds and the stories make this unexpectedly, a real page turner because it is full of twists and turns. I found myself reading passages aloud to family and friends and they all wanted to borrow the book when I finished. As someone who lives with many dogs, I can attest to the authenticity of the subject matter. As a reader I can heartily recommend it"
1,Proof Broadway is Sinking,"Broadway Producers are getting so desperate for a hit, they'll do anything. Stephanie Block delivers the only decent number with ""Love to Hear the Music"", but one song doesn't justify this horror.Who told Hugh Jackman he could sing?No, seriously, I want to meet the person sitting behing the casting desk who said to themselves, ""That's him! That's the man that will carry this entire show and blow people away with his powerhouse vocals!""They need a good punch in the face.Jarrod Emmick (Rocky Horror Show) is wasted here in a thankless role, when in reality, he's the only one that can sing.Don't get me wrong... I'm sure the poor women doing the bad impersonations of Judy and Liza are really quite good, but their over-the-top attempts at capturing their characters is so distracting it's hard to think of much else."
2,Frantic Fun,"I think the closest game to compare Expendable to is the old Reloaded game on the Playstation. It has the same fast and furious pace, and the gameplay is very good for those seeking mindless mayhem when there isn't time to play an adventure game or RPG.Unlike Reloaded, this game does not allow you to select different characters that are specialized in particular weapons. That would have given the game added replay value, perhaps increasing the fun score to 5 stars. Nonetheless, the assortment of weapons available and the eye watering visuals were enough to persuade me to play the game 5 times through now."
1,Only an idea,I agree with the other two machinists/gunsmiths. The drawings were terrible and sometimes the tolerances didn't add up. This manual is good for a general idea on a design and nothing else. I completed mine and it shoots great but not before I redesigned about 30% of it. Don't listen to the one guy. It's obvious he's never cut a chip in his life.
2,Feel Less Alone,"Great help for anyone starting their caregiving journey as caregivers will benefit from reading how other's have survived their situations. Filled with insights, solutions and practical advise. In addition, you may want to read my book, 'Elder Rage', if you are coping with a challenging elder starting to show signs of dementia. Both books will help you cope!-Jacqueline Marcell, Author 'Elder Rage, or Take My Father... Please! How to Survive Caring for Aging Parents', International Speaker on Eldercare & Alzheimer's"
1,Long time coming,I give it three stars. Happy ending for all. Love when animals share the space on the pages.Enjoy the story.
1,Don't waste your time or money.,There is so much hype surronding this book so I thought I would try it. I am sorry I did. I love Gone With the Wind and this is a slap in the face to Ms. Mitchell's work. I am sorry the judge didn't prevent the publication. If you have a few hours to waste then this book is for you but I don't recommend it to anyone.
2,"Teachers life, taachers must read!","Frank McCourt's ""Teacher Man"" is a definite must read for all teachers, and also those who would want to know more of what it takes to be and live as a teacher. This short Memoir really illustrates the travails of the teaching job."
2,Good introductary book,I bought this book and the information I got in the first 10 minutes already worth the invesment. Nice book about winsock programming with sections cover both winsock 1.1 and 2.0
2,This is the most user friendly Bible you can use.,The Open Bible gives you the best references without clouding the Word of God.
1,what a mess,"This is a pure headache-inducing mess! Bad acting from everyone involved, a bunch of dumb trippy effects, the overall story is worthless, just totally annoying! This movie is only for rebellious teenagers. For everyone else, it's just 2 hours of your life that you'll never get back."
2,Amazingly fun!,"Got this a couple of days ago on a whim. What a riot! Truly amazing. Takes a few flights to get the hang of ""not spinning around"". Like real choppers, it's easy to over-control. I AM a real chopper pilot, btw. :)I have crashed it a couple of dozen times and it still works fine (unlike real helicopters!) There is no fore and aft control, just altitude and yaw (rotate left/right). It just sorta wanders around and I think it's pretty cool. If I were buying it for a child, I would trim it up first, then let the child give it a shot. Loses trim after each on/off, btw. Also, don't bother trying a gentle, controlled take-off. Just get it up and flying!"
1,Bad out of the box.,"Purchased the vec1086 bbd charger, put it on the shelf for later use. When I needed it, plugged it in and got the ""fault"" light.It's been over a year so I now own a paperweight."
1,Disappointed...,"I knew I was taking a chance ordering this item after reading all the other reviews. It arrived in a single flimsy box that had multiple holes in it. The tape job was so poor that the board slid out as soon as I brought it inside. I realize that based on the price, this isn't the best quality board out there, but if they just packaged it correctly it would be fine. Mine arrived cracked in two places, bent and with a dirty piece of tape on the board that pulled the coating off when I removed it. Overall, I was very disappointed. Thankfully, I didn't have any issues with the return - just boxed it back up and UPS is going to pick it up tomorrow. I guess you get what you pay for in this case. :("
1,tastes horrible!,"these capsules taste pretty awful, blood looks realistic thoughI wouldn't buy them again since they taste HORRIBLE, and at 25 cents per capsule they're not a bargain."
2,"The closest anyone has come to ""classical rock.""","Sadly overlooked, even by many E.L.O. fans, ""E.L.O. II"" is Jeff Lynne's rock masterpiece (let's face it, ""A New World Record"" is a pop album). A quarter century after its release, it's still the closest anyone has come to producing something that can be called ""classical rock"" with a straight face. From the Move-like 'In Old England Town,' to the raveup of Chuck Berry's 'Roll Over Beethoven' (a Top 40 hit in the U.S.), to the majestic 'Kuiama,' ""II"" is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow chased by Yes, The Moody Blues, Emerson, Lake, & Palmer, Genesis, and others. The playing on the album is downright virtuostic and Lynne's production is top-notch as usual. You wonder after your first listen to the album why the band didn't explore some of the ideas on ""II"" further (""On The Third Day"" bares no resemblance); on your second listen you realize they didn't need to."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"Ruben seems like a nice guy with a warm smile and nice dimples. He's a good singer but FACE IT -- he's NOT a great singer. Every time I hear his voice, I just picture him on stage with sweat pouring down his face. His voice doesn't have much vocal range and some of his words are mumbled so you can't understand him."
2,Must have for Steely Dan Fan,"I bought this book because I love Steely Dan's music and wanted to learn their songs. These are keyboard arrangements, for intermediate to advance piano. It has guitar chords, too, but not as correct as ""The best of Steely Dan, guitar tab"", which you need if you want to learn the guitar solos and nuances. I also noticed that some of the piano chord voicings don't quite sound like the record. and some of the songs aren't written in the same key as the record. But overall, a great book to get you on your way."
1,Not one of the better ones,"At first glance, this book looked very helpful. But then I actually followed the book and the resume I ended up with was VERY cluttered. So are most of the examples in the book, which all follow the same look: very little white space, too much information crammed in, overuse of bullets - all leading to a single-spaced, bullet-heavy, text-intensive resume. This book seems to assume that recruiters and others will take the time to read the whole thing when often the opposite is true. Just a glance at the layout may be enough to put them off instead. I just can't recommend it when there are books like ""Resumes That Knock 'Em Dead"" by Martin Yate or ""The Damn Good Resume"" by Yana Parker (which got me good jobs for years)."
2,"A very good documentary, and a good collection of some low profile matches","Overall it's a good DVD set. The documentary is excellent, so are the extras. As far as the matches go, what I like is that they haven't included matches previously released in 'From The Vault' DVD set. Unlike the earlier set, this set contains some of Shawn's excellent but low profile matches. This DVD set combiner with From The Vault DVD set makes a good Shawn Michaels collection. My only complaint is that neither of these two DVD sets contain the HBK vs Kurt Angle match that took place at Wrestlemania 21.I wish the WWE releases another 3 disk DVD set on Shawn Michaels some years from now. That would make a complete collection of HBK's career along with the previous two DVD sets."
2,Great Product,"I would highly recommend this product to any pet owner. My 2 cats love having the fresh water to drink at all times and I love not having to change their water constantly. I will say they were aprehensive at first, but once they got used to the new device they really like it."
2,Great Product,I am on my 3rd headlight and I use it constantly. I have had to replace because the small tabs inside the battery case were broken. Wish they were stronger but it is the best I have tried and that was quite a few including other more expensive models by Petzl.
1,Poor book,I just finished using this book for my blueprint reading class. I could not believe how many errors were in the book. I am surprised that the would even consider using a book with so many errors.
1,Avoid,"This is a dog. Avoid. I was hopeful that this line up would entertain, but it's slow and weak compared to my Hutcherson favorites (The Kicker, Dialogue, Stick-up)."
1,"Whatever it is, it's not John Galsworthy","I cannot understand why the producers of this new version of the mini-series chose to decimate the story, and to omit the beauty of John Galsworthy's language. Irene is not a brunette, and the actress who portrays her here simply does not have the eternal beauty that forms so much description (fully realized visually in the first version) from the novels. It is hard to see what the attraction is to her here. The story has been changed, as has the ending. But why? Is Galsworthy not good enough? What remains (or, rather, what is) is a relatively mundane soap opera - not bad, but who cares. Definitely, absolutely get the first version. Or, better yet, read the books."
2,Still going strong,This watch is my daily go-to watch when I am just running around shopping or exercising. The features are easy to learn and it is a nice looking device. The heart monitor fits me well and comfortably and it reports consistent heart rate results. I have had to change the battery once after a respectable amount of usage. It appears to be a bit of a challenge but by using the right tool (mini phillips-head screwdriver) it took me just a few minutes to get the back off and pop in a new battery. Saved me the cost and time of taking it to the jeweler for replacement.
1,Only for fans of B action movies and Jeff Wincott,"Jeff Wincott is a hardcore gambler who is about to leave Vegas, but not without paying off a debt he owes. When he pays it off he ends up getting bullied into a fight. He loses the fight, his money, and his girlfriend.Ugh, this movie is pretty bad. Everything is predictable, and the acting by the girlfriend is horrible. The only good thing is Jeff Wincott. He gives a good acting performance, and like always he shows some great emotion in his fight scenes. There are a ton of fights in this movie, but none are really good. Gary Daniels gets a decent cameo fight, but the only fight I liked was the finale. Not even the finale was that good, but it picks up by the end of it. So in short, I recommend passing on this movie unless you are a really huge fan of Jeff Wincott.2/5Picture quality on the Madacy DVD is decent. Best thing about this DVD is that it has 45 minutes of trailers."
2,MUST SEE,YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS IS A MUST SEE FOR THOSE WITH A DARK HEART WHEN IT COMES TO COMEDY. FAST PACED MOVIE AND WITTY SCRIPT MAKE THIS A MUST SEE.
1,Thanks for letting me know,"I was skeptical when I purchased this product...my skepticism was well placed...WIthin the first hour of my road trip, I saw flashing lights in my rearview mirror. It was a second after I noticed the lights in my rearview that the detector decided to ""inform me"" that there was a police officer attempting to pull me over.The detector did a mediocre job of going off with enough time to slow down enough...Needless to say, I got 1 ticket on my roadtrip and drove 5+ the rest of the time...Disappointment."
2,I'm glad somebody found this record,"Recorded in 1969 and hidden in the Blue Note vaults for 34 years Hill's nonet album features the likes of Joe Farrell, Woody Shaw, Ron Carter and Lenny White. Using two trumpets, trombone, French horn, and a mixture of tuba, bass clarinet, English horn and various other reeds Hill's writing is as original and off-kilter as ever and the soloing shifts from earthy blues, to adventurous post-bop all placed in Hill's distinctive soundscapes."

2,lifelike drawing,i would recomend this book for those who want hints and tips on realistic drawing. it gives practice and techniques to help learn and you will learn if you are willing
1,I like the cover,"This cd certainly has an odd atmosphere to it. Perhaps the beginning of track #13 ""Exotica"" is a clue as to why, when a voice recites ""It's hard not to be open minded when you take psychedelics once a week...take psychedelics once a week...take psychedelics once a week..."". It then fades out into music. The tracks on this cd are rather laid back and odd, as if they were created by very inexperienced musicians messing around on synthesizers. However, it is track #4, ""Next"", that has me pull out this cd occasionally. It's nothing spectacular, but has a sort of mellow droopy groove that is somewhat appealing to me. I also heard it on either a television or radio commercial once. Otherwise, this cd is difficult to really like, even after repeated listenings. It's more annoying and boring than appealing."
2,Will change my life!,I actually bought this album on cassette for 33cents used and just heard it for the first time last night...WOW! I never heard a concept album or any album that moved me so much...these guys are amazing!
2,Fabric Convertible Top? You Need To Use RaggTopp!,"I have used this product for over five years both the cleaner and the protectant. It is well worth the cost. Eventhough you have to be careful in the application of the protectant by wiping off any excess from glass or paint work or go the extra step and cover the glass and paint work the benefits of RaggTopp protectant far exceed the time it takes to cover the exposed areas of the car. Previously I ordered RaggTopp from a well-known auto detailing site but I had a problem with the nozzle. The product ""pooled"" leaving dollops vs. an even spray pattern. I had spots on a black fabric top. I suspected a design flaw but I did not receive a response from the seller to my e-mail inquiring about the problem. I decided to use Amazon because of its reputation for customer service. I did not have the same problem with the can of protectant I received from T C Global."
1,Won't stamp metal,This product does not have enough force to stamp metal. Maybe it would stamp aluminum foil? We bought the brass tags to stamp and they were too hard. This stamp did not even leave a scratch. We were so disappointed.
1,not worth the price,"i like the concept. But it is definitely overpriced and not worth it. I bought it for my daughter and i wish i could return it but its a christmas gift from ""santa"" so we are stuck with it."
1,"Interesting Fantasy World, But","I read a lot of Sci Fi and Fantasy. I read one of Sharon Shinn's more recent works and liked it a lot. This book started out interesting. As it progressed the number of missed oppotunities began to get anoying. It was kind of like watching ""Three's Company"", everybody on a different track. A third of the way in I started speed reading thinking it would get better. Wrong! The lead character Rachel never matured and stayed as obnoxious as ever. When she walked away AGAIN near the end, I did a rare thing and put the book down in frustration with 40 pages to go. How it ends I don't care. It was a long path to nowhere. A waste of a good imagination."
2,The glass castle,The glass castle is a peek inside the chosen life style of some people in America. As kids we sometimes wish we had parents like that but as adults we're glad we didn't.
2,The best children-corn film since the first.,"When I first saw that they made another children of the corn film,I just said it's going to be a repeat of the first. I was wrong. The movie was awsome and almost as better as the first. The cast of the movie,was wonderful. Even the girl who play lacy,now she look like a wonderful person to work with on the movie. Also my hat off to the director David price who did a good job with the final sacrifice,his work,and any ideas that he had on the film with the writers on the scenes were great."
1,one of Paul's worst albums,Worst if not the worst album. I can't believe someone compared this album to Ram in one of the reviews. These lyrics are so predictable I find that I could sing the next line before Paul did my first time listening to most of it. (...)
1,Dissapointed,Ah I was very dissapointed in this book big time! I saw no plot in this book what so ever. It was long and extremely boring. Chapter after chapter of women just talking. The ending just ended that's it. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I hate I have to give this book such a bad review I just felt it could of been a lot better... Sorry
1,Not Happy,"I bought this and set it up, it doesn't provide a faster speed or farther range then my previous router it is the exact same, It was a waste of 72 dollars because I cant return it because it's opened I saw and heard such good reviews about it, I'm severely disappointed. If any one has any idea why this doesn't work as it should please help me out. I currently have AT&T; U-Verse Max internet and I was using the wireless router provided to me from AT&T.;Thanks."
1,Beware - this video can be scarey for some children,"My twins (22 months) love elmo and I wanted them to try something else. So we rented this DVD, one of the twins was very scared of some of the scenes in this video. It had her screaming in terror. The scenes with the dark backgrounds, especially the one with the touch globe were the ones that were frightening to her."
1,Not enough Emotions and Passion,"I felt as if this book was very long althought it only had two hundred and something odd pages. The beginning of the book started out okay but as the story went on it seems there was no ending to it.Carter is trying to find out who murdered his foster brother David, which is really not dead. Carter then notices that Delicia's dauther has a resemblence to his brother, but does not believe his brother will abandoned his child. Delecia tells him a man by the name of Richard fathered her child and left her. Things began to twist and they become attracted to each other when they try to figure out who is murdered and who did the murder.Carter and Delecia's relationship does not has passion as I think it should have. This book is not quite up there with other arabesque novels I read. There is not enough ""umph"" in this novel."
2,"Investigative, though speculative","This book provides a creative spur on Christianity and its historical context--in both parts logical theology and empiricism. The main problem of this book, however, is that it is mostly based on speculation. Yet, it has to be; significant historical records that could have definitively proven or refuted most of this book's hypotheses sadly do not exist.If anything, this book shouldn't be regarded a totally heretical or meaningless work; it should be a small part of a focused devotion to learning and understanding one's faith. At the very least, one should realize the true amount of disinformation out there--and, thus, the need for the discerning eye."
2,"Awesome book, couldn't put it down!!","I was looking for a book that could help me with easy-to-understand writings to help with bible study. This book is beautifully written with lovely pictures and is very user friendly. It helps get me through my days, as I get depressed sometimes, and is hard to put down once you start reading it."
1,Not the best toy,We had this toy for one day and the arm came off. My 5 year old has not been that interested in playing with it. Not the best toy I have purchased.
2,A jewel,"TTD's Vibrator is a stunning piece of solid music work. It is also undeniable that it is a work of pure genius, I feel sorry that such a brilliant musician seems to be so underestimated by general music public - everyone should buy this album!!"
1,Good looks aren't everything,"I was hooked. Good looking and a great bod! We were happy together but it started to be different when my hand became wet and cold. I knew we could work it out so I changed to a rubber washer to seal to the hose. Better, I thought, but when I dropped it to the ground after watering, the lever broke off. Still I would not give up on this beauty and fashioned a new lever from steel putty. We were happy again until I used it today. The plastic inner which the lever is fastened to broke off and with it I lost my love of this luscious bodied beauty which now lies at the bottom of the garbage can. A 10 month affair is over."
1,Not the original Gio...,"Smells great, 'just like' Gio, and the price is really good but the package and the bottle are not original. If you are looking for the original product, don't go with this one."
1,Hard work,"Reading the first book of ""The Autograph Man"" is most of the time very annoying. The protagonist of the story, Alex-Li Tandem, a half chinese half jewish autograph man gets drunk and stoned every day, consequently there is no real action. In the secon part of the book there is some kind of a plot, the story beginns to develope and so it gets more interessting for the reader. The open ending is a bit disappointing because the reader doesn't know how the life of Alex will go on. All in all the book contains too much unimportant details and the protagonist is a kind of a person you can't identify with nor you can like him anyway. If you have the power to finish the book you really can be proud of you!!!"
2,Like sitting and having a beer with a great storyteller!,"When I picked up this book I was a bit worried that the ""Mick"" from the WWF is just a character. Well, he is, but not in the way that I worried about. Mick is the same great guy that appears on TV and at promo appearances.In reading Mick Foley's book I find myself feeling like I'm sitting on a barstool listening to the best storyteller in town, except in this case he's telling his life story.Mrs. Foley should be very proud of her little boy, he's done a terrific job (as in employment, not as in losing) in writing his life story."
2,Learning About the Story of Christianity,"I am taking a course in Church History in seminary. This is the first time I have engaged in some indepth study and appreciation of my faith and its roots. This book is outstanding in that the author does an effective job of expounding on personalities, the development of the church, and specific movements which are somewhat complex, and yet uses terms which are easily understood for a new seminary student. I am glad I took this course and especially glad my professor chose this book to introduce graduate students to such extensive information."
1,In the Minority,"As a voice for the minority, may I say that I did not care for this book. The story seemed contrived and self-consciously Toni Morrison-ish. In addition, the strange theology of the ""sisterhood of man and motherhood of Mary"" was simply asinine to me."
1,Kindle edition plagued by errors,"I went with the Penguin edition because it seemed to have the best reviews out of all the editions available. While I'm sure the paperback edition is fine, the Kindle version is an absolute mess.It looks like this edition was made using OCR and a scanner. Foremost among its problems is that the word ""the"" routinely appears as ""die"" or ""lie"". This happens about once per page throughout the entire book.The font size changes from paragraph to paragraph. Punctuation is often missing or wrong. Commas sometimes appear as the number ""3"" in a subscript or something else fun like that. The letter ""l"" is frequently replaced by the number ""1"" (these look very different on a Kindle).Line breaks appear where they shouldn't, and spaces are often missing between words.I've seen similar problems with other books on Kindle, though usually only for freebies. Since there are several free versions of this book available, I'd advise avoiding this one."
1,THYROMINE HEALTH,"THYROMINE HEALTH SUPPLEMENT & WEIGHT LOOS PILL ,i DIDN'T LOSE ANY WEIGHT WITH THESE SUPPLEMENTS AND I DIDN'T FEEL ANY BETTER WITH THEM"
2,Excellent A+A+,The is a very entertaining book and the writing by this author is excellent. Her book are great....
1,BORING!!!!,"My daughter loves her other Leap Pad stories and activity books, but she was bored with this one. As she got older, I hoped she would grow into it. She is now almost three, and it still doesn't interest her. Plus, it is really no different than the regular book. (She would rather have me read the real book than listen to it on the Leap Pad.) Save your money- buy the book, don't buy the Leap Pad version."
2,Great Christian Teaching Aide,"This is a full color, large, poster-sized map of all 4 of the Apostle Paul's missionary journeys. I used this as a visual aide for a class at church camp and it really helped the children comprehend the lesson to a greater extent. Great price for such a valuable tool!"
2,"Works great, a bit large for me","A great large nonstick pan. I wish we had a cover big enough to fit it. If I could do it again I might get a slightly smaller one. This one is bigger than the size of a large dinner plate, which can make it hard to turn certain dishes out for serving."
1,The Deception in buying this book is that---,"it would be a good book, worth the money I spent for the hard cover. Well, what a big fat disappointment. This book should have been an excellent read; it has all of the elements I love in a story of True Crime. But alas, as someone else who reviewed the book pointed out, it is written like a trashy true romance novel. I understand that women can be naieve, but give me a break. I truly stopped caring about Brenda after she was almost killed after her car was rammed and she almost died; she still never suspected her husband-she actually had to overhear him talking about planning her murder on the telephone before she realized what was going on. I think if the style of writing had been more sophisticated it could have been a good read but as it is, it wasn't. save your money."
1,The index in this book is virtually worthless.,"A friend tells me that there is an easier way to set things up using the FORMAT function. I know little about this function and go to this text book to read up. Unfortunately, the FORMAT function is not in the index.I want to look up ITEM DATA VALUES for assigning text into list/combo boxes which the computer sees a related number which is easier for the computer to digest; however, the topic is NOT in the index.I go to the library and look through a variety of Visual Basic textbooks and all list above topics in index and explain topics precisely.These are just two of my many problems using a very limited index. If you are going to use this text as a reference book, you are going to find yourself very frustrated. I know I am regretting purchasing this book."
1,Couldn't make it all the way through,"I bought this book while working through our first adoption. We were struggling with deciding between the different types of domestic adoptions. I thought this book would give some insight. I have to say, it was challenging to get through. I actually could not finish the book. It seemed wordy to me and did not come to any clear points - in the parts that I read anyway. I believe there are better organized, more fact-based books out there for those interested in learning about the pros and cons about the different types of domestic adoptions."
2,a nice gift to my wfie,"I bought it as a birthday gift to my wife, and she loves it.It is a nice watch."
2,Kate Hepburn ala Rex Harrison!,"Just think Chanel meets Henry Higgins and you've got Ms. Hepburn's singing in this musical! It may not be melodic, but it's certainly worth listening to, if only to once again hear that marvelous voice!Some of the lyrics are fantastic and some of the music is even catchy. Even though Chanel apparently didn't totally approve of this musical version of her life, it looks like Cecil Beaton captured her style amazingly well in the costumes (based on the liner photos) and the set has elements of Chanel's apartment and salon which I recently saw in Paris.I only regret that there is no DVD of this production."
2,Short but sweet.,Having read Hardwired a couple weeks ago I picked this up on the strength of some of the previous reviews left. I loved this novella and thought it really complimented my experience of having read Hardwired. The story picks up from Reno's perspective at the end of Hardwired which was awesome because whilst reading Hardwired I wondered what had happened to him and how he fared. His story is as kick-ass as it is poignant and honestly makes me like him more than I liked the main characters from Hardwired (who were also pretty awesome). My only complaint is that the story is too short but don't let that dissuade you. 3 bucks is a steal for something this great and it really does add to the experience of the first book. Now its time for me to start up on Voice of the Whirlwind.
2,Great music,"I love this CD. CPR makes the kind of music I love. For an even better experience, go to youtube and listen to the live versions of some of these tunes."
2,Excellent Works,This is definitely the one CD I recommend besides Badmarsh's Differences EP to any fan of jungle and drum 'n bass music. Very catchy tunes with lots of cool sitars and some phat beats make this a CD worth your money!
2,plastic,"Being made of plastic, and not very heavy duty, I don't know how long it will last. I took a old stainless water type fire extinguisher, cut off the nozzle, attached a hose, then attached the filler to the end. Watering batteries is now a breeze.Update: Because I used a cheap pressure regulator, it overpressured and blew the hose barb off. So it lasted a few months. It worked great while it worked."
1,Obsessed With Nothing,"I checked out this book from my local library, after hearing it mentioned as a very well written graphic novel. I was hoping for something along the lines of 'Blankets' or 'BOPoison', but was very disappointed with a story that was never about much and never really went anywhere. It's a fictional story about a man [the author] who can't handle life, obsesses about minutia in the past, and nearly spends all of his time constantly moping about his depressing childhood and depressing life, over and over. Though he had some nice little observations, the author's character was so limp and self-obsessed about nothing that it was a frustrating read. I don't know how anyone could spend money on this, or give it a glowing review, but don't read it if you'd prefer characters who can face and struggle against life's challenges and disappointments. (ps. Go read Blankets or Pedro And Me again.)"
1,A little annoyed by this book,"After being in a sorority for a few years, I feel I have seen the good and the bad of my sorority. But the bad aspects that Ms. Robbin's writes about are a little far fetched. I do believe that some sororities out there (maybe in Texas) are psychologically and emotionally harmful as she states in her book, but not all. And I think that the information she released in her book about rituals was a little upsetting. My advice to anyone thinking about purchasing this book: Please don't assume all sororities are like this. Because they aren't! Especially the ones on my campus. Books like these sort of add to the already rumored ""sorority life"" that is 95% untrue! So when reading this book just keep an open mind and don't assume all sororities are the same! Thank you!"
1,My office hates it,"This is not a user-friendly machine. We have to keep the instructions on hand all the time. No one in my office knows how to use it, and it wastes one inch of tape per label. I've got a busy office of day traders and they're standing around with scissors like kindergarten children cutting these labels down to fit their files. Its a waste of time, not to mention the over-priced label tape.I have a Brother PT-65 at home which I love, its so user friendly I don't think I have picked up the instructions once. The labels cost 1/2 the price and it doesn't waste as much. I recommend that one instead."
1,Wake Me When It's Over.,"Buckland's too full of himself to give the subject an appropriate treatment. And besides, ritual binding and blindfolding? No, thank you."
2,"Generally, a good film...","The film version of ""Flowers in the Attic"" was a great movie for what it was. True, it didn't follow the plot of the novel as well as I had hoped, but due to the effectiveness of the casting this movie is, nonetheless, captivating. The decision to place Louise Fletcher in the role of the grandmother was the dynamic that pulled the entire film together and made it work. Her on-screen presence lent that special spark to the role and I doubt that anyone else could have played her more successfully. And, in this day's society of movie and television watchers, perhaps this film's brief glimpse into the world of V. C. Andrews will be enough to draw new generations of readers..."
1,"fasle advertisement, misrepresentationNOT KILLER PRIEST","this case displays the movie killer priest and has pictures from the movie and the short uninformed summary of the original killer priest..but when i popped in the disc labeled ""killer priest""...i saw a totally different film from the old classic i know and love!!!!! there was NO evil conman/sorceror, NO iron palm!! and of course NO levitating ""killer priest"".check out the REAL killer priest on vhs. its under wu tang collection, but its not part of their shoddy dvd series!!!!!!its a hard to find tape, most likely to be able to find on ebay, or websites for genre flix.i contacted XENON and GOT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!"
2,A good read,"If you've read Moon in the Water and Chains of Fate, I'm sure you'll like Belle's last book dealing with this branch of the Heron family. (She also wrote Lodestar, which goes back in time a few generations to tell about the life of Christopher Heron.) As with all of the other books by Belle I've read, she really sucks you into the story with fascinating characters set against a turbulant and interesting time in history. This book picks up with the daughter of Francis and Thomasine, Alethea. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the first two books, but that has nothing to do with Belle's efforts. Her writing was a wonderful as ever, I just didn't identify with Alethea as well as some of the other characters. However, she is still a well-developed and interesting character in her own right. And to say, ""I didn't enjoy it as much as the other two"" means very little. This book still makes a fascinating read."
2,Awesome!,"Just bought this batt tender to replace a cheapo noname unit that blew up two months ago..second one for my second bike, works as advertised..quality construction at a rock bottom price...I especially like the plug in attatchement that comes with it, just plug in and fuggetaboutit! highly reccomended!"
2,A must watch movie,"If you enjoy watching intelligent movies, you should not miss ""Hight and Low."" It has a unique structure, like two movies in one. The first part of the story tells us about a businessman who has to make a difficult choice. The second part shows us the police investigations in order to pin down the kidnapper. It's a very thoughful movie! 5 out of 5 stars.PS If you love ""Hight and Low"", get a chance to watchSeven Samurai - 3 Disc Remastered Edition (The Criterion Collection) Spine # 2)andRed Beard - Criterion Collection."
2,Delish!,"Ever since Williams-Sonoma created a tea for each season about a dozen years ago, I've been searching for a tea as good as their (now discontinued) Summer Tea, which was flavored with mango, passionfruit and had marigold petals in it. This one is about as close as I've come...it has lots of fruity/slightly floral/peachy flavor and is excellent iced. The price is good and it should last all summer. My only gripe is that it's not really a green product b/c EACH teabag is individually wrapped...really not necessary. Also, I agree with the reviewer who said that this tea is better than the plain peach tea. Enjoy!!"
1,Honestly the dumbest show ever,"I actually like sophomoric humor, so when I heard this movie was dumb - funny I figured it would an evening of mindless entertainment. It wasn't even funny. We turned it off about 45 minutes into it and didn't even watch the whole thing."
2,Sanjean WR-1 FM/AM Wood-Cabinet Radio,This is a really good radio. The reception quality is excellent. I bought this radio as a gift for my son and he's really pleased with it. I am happy I made this purchase.
2,Kindle edition is 1st printing. Please replace the server data with the latest pring to reflect the errata,"One of my favorite Cisco Press books.Although the Kindle edition is 1st printing which doesn't reflect the errata, there are not so many corrections, so buy whichever edition suits your needs.I hope they'll replace the server data with the latest printing though."
2,Absolutely Phenomenal!!!,"This DVD is absolutely amazing. The imagery is stunning and the music is beatiful and ethereal, extremely appropriate as you are watching the footage from concert feeds from widespread icelandic towns. Admittedly I was already a huge sugr ros fan beforehnad, but this is the most amazing documentary of a band that ever existed. I would recommend this as a gift to anyone, regardless of their musical preferences. The music is awe inspiring and the video footage is too amazing to not be seen by everyone!"
2,enjoyed this,"can't wait to see the final conflict part two. this is to me the best of potter, glad to see him finally grow into his destiny.A+ on this movie too. this one makes you hate to see it come to an end."
1,"Very heavy reading, not useful for poker players","This book is heavy on philiosphy and has very little of interest to poker players. But it is so heavy that it is slow, difficult reading. I have a masters in engineering and I like philosophy, but not this book. It was like torture going through it, looking for something interesting. If you want to learn poker philosophy, I recommend Doyle Brunson's ""Poker Wisdom of a Champion"" formerly titled ""According to Doyle"" which is excellent."
1,Mardi Gras Massacre,"If you love cheesy horror flics this is for you.If you liked the films shown by ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"", or ""Chiller"" then this is what you want. If you can't see the humor in a really bad low budget horror film, then this is not for you."
1,The Uncensored Life and TImes of Darryl Dawkins,"This book is Darryl to a ""T"". If you knew Darryl you would see his personality in the writing. Darryl entertains, sensationlizes, he is a great tall tale teller and this book is a perfect example of that. While there is no doubt some of these things happened, the book is exaggerated for selling. As in the Oliver Stone's JFK movie , this book is fiction based on fact which makes for entertaining reading."
2,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoeinx,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was an excellent book!! In my opinion it was the best Harry Potter book yet. J.K. Rowling keeps you wondering when Voldemort will surface just long enough to build suspense. The characters are changing and growing up and Rowling does an excellent job showing this! I plan to reread the book again, simply for fun!!"
1,hot garbage,"FIRST OF ALL THESE KATS GET CARRIED NUMEROUS OF TIMES, THEN THEYRESPONSES ARE WACK, BEATS ARE LAIM,#1 OF THEM ALL, BROWNOSING WITH 112 ON VIDEOS THAT MY FRIENDS IS OUT 4 REAL."
1,Not Happy!!,When I ordered this particular Set I thought I would get the Set that I saw and The exact Title Collector's Edition. Well that is not what I received I received a Plan DVD CASE with a Picture Of Season One and Just 2 DVD's inside! I would have Like to Know Before Hand that it wouldn't be the Collector's Edition!! I bought Season 2 from another Site and the only reason I didn't get Season One from that is Because I Really wanted this Special Edition and I didn't Get It! Not Happy! A little Disappointed But I got Season One!
2,I'm reading this one again!,The book had me at hello. It was glued to my hands! Being an Aussie chick I loved relating to the characters and the Australian backdrop of the novel. I'm reading this one again.Allison Rushby...power to ya!
1,Fiction Junk,"I read this after all the fraud information came to light so I read it as it really was -- a work of fiction. It stunk. If the book had actually been true it would have been good only because it was amazing that all of that could really happen. But since I know it's all fake, I read it as a fantasy and it really stunk. Those defenders who say it doesn't matter whether it is true are speaking nonsense. There are far better and far better written works of ficiton out there that should be read before this second rate act. All of this fraud indicates James Frey has some real probelmns -- just not the ones he made up in the book."
2,Go Dixie Chicks,This album is great! I like Fly a lot to but I think this one has better songs! You should get this CD if you don't have it!
1,Two stars for having lots of nice photos,"The title of this book is misleading--it is NOT comprehensive in any way, it covers only the high-performance Camaros (RS, SS, Z28, Yenko, COPO, etc.), with the information being very basic in scope. The many detailed color photos are the only reason to buy this book.Although I would consider it an easy read, sometimes it's tough to accept all of the errors. Like the other reviewers here, I'm really convinced that MBI forgot the entire editing process with this one. The author probably knows the subject matter, but it hardly shows with all of the mistakes, misinformation and poor grammar.For a few bucks more, I would highly recommend ""Camaro"" [ISBN: 0760319324] by Anthony (Tony) Young. It's definitely the best Camaro book I've found!"
1,"Its er, ok...at best","I read the book over a few days after reading the hype about it.It was a pleasant read - but I found it very hollow. There wasnt much substance to it and, after each person visits Eddie and leaves, you feel like there are more questions than answers.The book didnt do much for me and had no lasting impact..."
2,My daughter enjoyed it.,"In the end all that matters is what your children think and my daughter really enjoys Hamster Huey. Mabel Barr's first foray into childrens literature may not be as glamorous and glossy as some, but it is a cute story that the kids seem to enjoy. When you make a 4 year old smile you are doing alright by me."
1,I guess even the Saw Doctors can strike out eventually.,"I found none of the charm, wit and joie de vivre of the other Saw Doctors albums I love. It was just too redolent of old men sitting around being nostalgic."
2,the best dance your a** off CD on the shelves today,"What's your techno style? Detroit is the birth place of techno as we know it today. Many of the original DJs had to look within themselves for the inspiration to construct soulful music when surrounded by a post-industrial town verging on deconstruction. Stacey is a second generation by-product of this social experiment. His music is the result of years of fine tuned skill acquired by mixing with 3 or more decks at a time. I absolutely love this CD, and am desperately trying to get my hands on more of his stuff. This is the ultimate dance CD for people who like intelligent techno - or the real thing. BUY IT AND ENJOY THE AURAL ORGY OF SOUND!"
2,Stay Far Away from Caves,Very suspenseful and scary gem of a horror movie. The tension just keeps growing until you can't take it anymore. The creatures are simple but effective especially in the right light. Can't wait to see what the director does next. Ignore the awful sequel.
1,Straight garbage!!!,"Nothing but garbage from beginning to end. This must've taken N.O.R.E. all of two days to put together...at least that's how it sounded. He's never been a strong lyricist (but I still liked N.O.R.E. and God's Favorite), but this puts him at the very bottom of the skilled lyricist list.Don't waste your money!!!"
1,Click the back button... NOW,"I bought this item, thinking it was a dream come true. I've never played ps2 wirelessly before. But this controller had major functionality problems. say you are running your character around with the left analog stick... every 5 seconds he ran the opposite way i pointed him to. Yeah, I dont want to majorly present this item as a fraud, but i would definitely suggest you find another version of the ps2 wireless controller."
1,Waste of Money,I thought this would be good for black outs. I paid $20 and out of the box it never worked. The White LEDs onlystay lit as long as you crank. However the worthless amber side lights will light. I threw it away the first day.
1,Almost never played with.,"I guess these work ok but they do not stay on your ear very well at all which is very frustrating to a kid. My kids played with them very little because of this, would not recommend this to anyone."
1,do not waste your time or money,"THIS BOOK WAS THE NEAREST NOTHING I HAVE EVER READ. SHE NEEDS TO TAKE LESSONS ABOUT WRITING VAMPIRE BOOKS FROM MAGGIE SHAYNE OR NANCY GIDEON OR CHRISTINE FEEHAN, IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK YET, PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON IT. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE."
1,A double-edged sword,"On the one hand, the Dura-Brite formula produces printouts that are resistant to the sort of smearing that ink jet output in known for. On the other hand, this same formula may be what has forced me -- and many others, according to the reviews I've read -- to trash the C84 ink jet printer. Many people, myself included, have found that said printer suddenly stops working because of clogs that can't be unclogged, and one widely accepted theory is that this ink has dried to such an ultra-hard consistency that it has gummed up the works beyond all repair. So if you have an Epson ink jet printer that's still working, just be very careful to follow all recommended precautions to keep it working -- and keep your fingers crossed. If you're trying to decide on a printer, I can't recommend Epson and this Dura-Brite ink."
2,Elizabeth George Speare rocks!,"Well, I've read of all of Speare's works that I can find, The Bronze Bow (awesome), The Sign of the Beaver, Calico Captive (finished it in a day), and The Witch of Blackbird Pond. This one beat them all! I never thought that she could write anything better than the Bronze Bow, but obviously, I was completely mistaken. In fact, this novel replaced my longstanding favorite book, Jane Eyre, as it slowly but surely crept its way up to number 1. I loved it; it's awesome; what else do I need to say? However, if you have no idea what good literature is, then you won't like this outstanding novel."
2,Great book,Very good book that teaches counting and basic concepts. Great illustrations - clear and colorful. Quick read so keeps the attention of very young readers. I love reading it to my 16 month old and she loves to listen to the story as well as look at the illustrations.
2,Perfect fit,"I bought this to replace the battery in the APC Battery Backup that protects the server in our office. The item arrived quickly, in excellent condition via United Parcel Service. After some initial dismay over not having any instructions as to how to get into the battery compartment (you almost have to take the entire UPS apart on the 1500 series), we got the new battery in place. It already had some juice in it, so we didn't have to wait on the typical 24 charge time with new units."
2,Interesting movie,"This movie was a more of a drama, and was relatively interesting. I watched it while I was writing a paper for my PhD program, and was still able to follow the movie...most of the excitement was towards the end of the picture. Katey Sagal (from Married With Children) was one of the stars in this show...I'm not sure who the other actors/actresses were, but they were all good."
1,Setting up straw men to knock them down . . .,"Just read the first two pages right here on the site to see what tired, familiar garbage this is. You'll meet the absurdly cliched character of the National Security Council head who ""loathes the military"" -- ""like his President"" (yes, it's a book full of gratuitous Clinton-bashing), is one of those arrogant elitist liberals who went to, you know it, Harvard, AND who's ""grossly overweight and disheveled."" I'm surprised they didn't also give him dandruff and bad breath. Tedious polemics unartfully garbed in the trappings of a thriller."
2,"Great soft keyboard, nice illumination","This is a really nice keyboard for programming (or gaming on less productive nights) late into the night. Although soem reviewers claim the illumination to be too bright, I feel that it's just the right level for me. I was afraid it would light up the room, but it just makes the keys shine without any interference to the monitor.Additionally, the keys are soft, quiet, and extremely responsive. A nice typing experience for someone who types quite a bit."
1,Doesn't stay still,"I used this since I got it. it works( my husband said I didn't snored when I worn it, but it doesn't stay still to the morning, and it always peels off at midnight sometimes I have to change three times before I go to bed. I thought it was my night cream caused it. but it wasn't. My husband bought one of other brand, and they never ever peel off during the sleeping. So I am going to return it when got the postage from this buyer. I don't think I would pay the shipping to ship back,because it didn't stay still.May"
2,A must read,Parents have so many different expectations of what they want their children to be. Dibs is a real eye-opener if you are able to just be present with the child. A must read for anyone who works with children.
2,this cd rules,"i love ""beep me 911"" and ""pass da blunts"" this cd is a most have for every cd collection"
2,Best Can opener ever!,I've been using the OXO can opener for nearly a year and it still operates as perfectly as when it arrived from Amazon. I can't believe I struggled all those years with an electric can opener.
1,old news,"so there's a lot of Jewish hip hop out right now and these guys just don't hold up...This is as bad if not worse than MOT. It's just not even trying to be good. If you want to hear some good hip hop with good music, check out Matisyahu or Chutzpah."
1,Does not work,I got this item as a wedding gift and the first time we tried to use it the whole bottom of the blender leaked margeritta mix all over our kitchen. Please do not buy this model! We couldn't return it either because we never received the gift reciept.
2,Good Stuff,"Of all the myriad of products our daughter has tried to control diaper rash, she says this is the best. Our pharmacist recommended it when the kids were here last Christmas. So, we used it and it finally got the rash under control. After she went home, (Florida), she couldn't find it. So, we were buying tubes locally and shipping them to Florida. Then, it ocurred to me that Amazon might have it-WALLA! We order it from Amazon and have it shipped there. SWEET!!! Or, rather, getting it there is now smoother than a baby's bottom!!!"
1,can't recommend this to anyone,"Near death experiences and Christianity DO NOT mix!!!!!!I believe that most NDEs are fabricated, written to cash in on the book market. It only misleads the already lost people who believe this sort of stuff. Unfortunately for the lost souls that read this book, they are not reading the truth, just made up and embellished stories for profit."
1,"Religious propaganda, masquerading as romance","This novel hides several agendas. For one thing, there is utterly no mention anywhere on the cover or interior that it's another installment of a published series. Since this is critical to the story, this omission, deliberate or accidental, is unforgivable.Pushed as a 'romance,' there is little to none in this story in the popular definition of historical romance novels. There is little history, either. Instead, the author uses the second half of the novel to 'prove' the stories of the bible are literal and true, one after another, in quick succession. And the heroine is pivotal to all of them. If the aim was to promote spirituality and pseudo-history, the author should have been a bit less devious about luring unsuspecting readers with this tripe.When the heroine is finally reunited with her husband, we discover they have no chemistry. If they do, it certainly isn't evident in the narrative. Don't bother with this one."
1,Excited about the book but am DISGUSTED with the shape of the book!,"I open my mailbox and say ""Oh Yes, the book is here!"" Unfortunately, i bought a new copy and got a book that looks like it should be in the TRASH! What company sells books ""NEW"" in this type of condition?!?! I will NEVER EVER buy from you again nor should anyone else! GOOD DAY"
2,Really liked it!,My 2nd Kay Scapetta novel and loved it. She is a terrific author and never ceases to amaze me. Liked the Key West theme.
1,An exercise in wheel-spinning,"The Bottom Line:A completely unnecessary film (Saw III wrapped things up pretty nicely, but the franchise is a cash cow so more keep coming) which is unbelievably transparent in its pathetic attempt to craft a continuing story out of the few loose ends that were leftover from the last installment, Saw IV could be described far better as ""desperate"" than ""scary"": the only reason to see this one is if you want to say you've seen every Saw.1.5/4"
1,do not like it,"Too light. When I let go of the mouse, the cord willusually pull the mouse.Something about the lightness and ergonomics causes the mouseto shift when I click unless I am paying attention.Middle mouse button requires way too much force to click.Everything else about the mouse is great.But the above makes it a pain to use."
2,Makes you think,"I have to read this book for my capstone class for my BBA. So far I am really liking it and wishing I had read it sooner. It is not a school book persay, but a must read for sure."
2,The Best show to hit television! Joe Lando is awesome!,"I love Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman!!!I have been a loyal and devoted Dr. Quinn fan for years and this is a must have for any fan of the show!!! I was so sad when it went off the air, and so excited when they released the first season on DVD! I have already watched my entire DVD collection and can't wait for the other seasons to be released! I have always loved the great chemistry between Micheala and Sully and it's wonderful to be able to go back to Colorado Springs to see how it all began! Even if you have never seen an episode, I guarantee that you will fall in love with Michaela, Sully and all the townspeople, and you will not be disappointed by watching these awesome shows!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I read a book by Jeff Long with the same title and about the same subject. Though the book started a bit slow, it took up speed and turned into one of the best reads ever, to me. I was wondering how they would turn something so interesting and complex, and psychological into a video. They didn't. This does not, at all, represent that book. If it pretended to and I were the author, I would sue. What a travesty. Boring, schlock, Hollywood representation, turning every interesting story into the outlike of a horror movie that once sold well. Please, if you like the idea of this story, buy the book. Don't Waste Your Time."
1,Only Received One Dumbbell,"My wife just opened her Christmas present and like others, there was only one dumbbell in the box. This is very disappointing on Amazon's part and my wife is annoyed she only has half her Christmas present. I hope Amazon makes this right. I did send an email to Bayou Fitness as well."
2,dog loves the taste of them,"rex really loves the taste, otherwise we'd have to give him the glucosamine in pill form which he hates. a really great way to give him the suppliment he needs"
2,THIS CD IS DA BOMB!!!!!!!!!,"THIS CD IS THE GREATEST CD I HAVE EVER BOUGHT BESIDES BACKSTREET AND BONE THUGS N' HARMONY. IN MY OPINION THIS CD IS TIGHT AND THE BEST SONGS ARE #1, #6, AND #11."
2,Tagalog English Dictionary,"This book is excellent. I use it all the time together with flashcards, voice recordings, on-line lessons, and classroom assignments. The first 30 pages is good for grammar and the back of the book, (appendix) has a lot of very useful information.I have tried a few other dictionaries, but this one clearly stands ahead of them."
2,Little farm from Fisher Price,This is a must for boys and girls! Could not recommend highly enough! This is a fantastic toy with sounding animals and a great barn setup. It is a good size so two can play at the same time. My kids love love it from the moment it was opened. Absolutely fantastic product from Fisher Price. A name you can trust to make really good educational and fun toys.
1,NoNoise is evil!!!!!!!,"Good idea. God-awful mastering. Every song was NoNosied to death. In a misguided attempt to remove the tape hiss, the music was destroyed. It even sounds bad on a boom box, much less a decent stereo system. This music could be mastered well, but the guys at Abbey Road are to in love with new gee whiz technology to do it right. Everything the Beatles did was recorded using Electron Tube equipment, and should be remastered with the same kind of equipment. The only way for you to hear the music on CD as it was meant to sound is to hunt down a mint copy of one of their original LPs and burn your own CD or buy a Bootleg sourced from the original vinyl."
1,Disappointing reproductions,I was really disappointed when I received the book. Most reproductions are washed out and I kept wondering if I would love this Van Dyck's work any more if his paintings look like that. I've seen many originals and their reproductions in this book are too bad for a serious catalog.
1,"Great movie, lousy digital copy","Movie is great, 5 star worthy and a fitting conclusion to the Nolan trilogy. The one star is due to the awful Ultraviolet digital copy that comes with the disk. Its not a simple download to your iTunes account, in fact it is NOT compatible with iTunes AT ALL! If you want to watch it on your iPad, you have to download an app and watch it through a flixster app. Sorry, but I won't tolerate this as a consumer. So no more future Blu-ray purchases with this Ultraviolet crap!"
1,doesn't block cold air due to bad design,too wide for the door... doesn't block cold air. I'll try to upload a diagram in the user photos to show what I am talking about.
2,Good enough for a Jetta,"I'm very pleased with this rack overall. It is a sturdy rack and a lot better than the ones I've seen from other manufacturers. A couple of points that I can make about it are that the hitch bolt/pin is longer than I'd expect it to be for a hitch this size. About an inch and half protrudes pass the opposite side of the hitch. The rubber piece which slides over the pin on the opposite end is a good idea however. The cotter pin seems a bit flimsy but will do the job. Another issue I found was related to the straps. They were coated with a heavy wax. Although washing in hot water and soap did the trick of removing it, I wonder why it's was used in the first place."
1,Don't buy this POS regulator,"Less than a month after installation, this regulator failed in a spectacular manner, gushing fuel out of the adjuster knob base. Yes, I was using this with a mechanical fuel pump as the manufacturer intended.I was extremely lucky that my car did not burn to the ground."
1,WHAT?!?!?!?!?!? Is this EBAY?!?!?!?!?,"The CD is just great, the mix is really cool but the single star is just for AMAZON, i dont know who the hell puts prices on the products, this is not EBAY, i saw this same CD LAST WEEK, BEING SELLED BY aMAZON FOR 16.00 DOLLARS, and now 41.00 dollars, its stupid and insane, I think that these idiots r trying to rip us off, ARMIN VAN BUUREN'S BOUNDARIES OF IMAGINATION IS DEFINATELY A GREAT TRANCE CD, but honestly, try to get it somewhere else, I've been an Amazon costumer for years but this really is stupid."
1,"Pretty bad, doesn't take reality into account...","I got a third of the way through it, and decided that he wasn't expaining anything new and his reasoning lacked reasonableness. I don't have too much time to waste on this so I'll describe the book as: contradictory, biased, unrealistic, similar to his other works about the collapse of the US in the 90's."
1,Shady Bizzness,"This book could have been good, but it definately needs editing.I believe Byron was trying to be friends with MM, but gripingconstantly behind his back about money ended any chance of that.Byson tries to portray a religious man, but says that he lied tohis regular job about why he took leave (to work on the tour). I lost respect for him with that. Good luck though, Byron, just be straight with people, backstabbing will get you every time."
1,Prophecy,I don't want to read any further. No man can direct his own step and this is clear as bells in the bible. I believe there are people out there that can read cards and those are theirs. I don't have to make this mine.
2,Missippian Culture for the General Reader,"The author has both excavated and written profusely on the Missippian Culture, centered in Cahokia to the East of Saint Louis, and the builders of the largest pyramids in North America. The culture flourished in the later Medieval times, just before the white men came to North America. Cahokia should be a famous as Chichen Itza and Tikal--this book is a superb introduction to the culture and to the scholarly discputes about its origins and acheivements.Every well educated American should be familiar with Missippian culture. Read this book!"
2,This Isn't Garbage!,"I watched the original ""Billy Jack"" many times and dreamed about being a part of this whole counter culture group. To me it wasn't funny garbage, but a very appealing way to live. I'm glad Amazon is offering the whole set of Billy Jack movies at an affordable price. The reason I gave it a four instead of a five star review is the fact that I now realize that as appealing as this lifestyle was to me as a teen from an alcoholic home, it may not be all that living in a fantasy world, I made it out to be. As a child and especially as a teen, I very much wanted to escape from the miserable reality of my horrid family situation. Having said that ""Billy Jack"" is a very enjoyable move."
2,Great series,"Once I started reading The Devil's Kiss, I couldn't put it down. Johnstone brings the age old battle of good vs. evil to a whole new level. Johnstone makes Sam Balon a man who everyone can look up to and want to try in their heart to be. I've never read a book that has defined a character of class and courage until now. I have read the other 2 books in the series and hopethat there is more then that. I highly recomend this to anyone who truely likes horror because this book will scare you into a whole new reality of the world."
2,Thinking person's book,"This book is for the thinking and feeling reader. Its universal issues and lovingly created characters and story will enthrall, enlighten and encourage. A truly great work of art."
2,Great Cd For Rock music lovers,"I first heard of them when i herad the song ""Kryptonite"" which i am sure everyone has heard. I liked that song right away. This is a great album. My favorite tracks are Let Me Go, Be Somebody, Right Where I belong, and The Real Life. Give those tracks a listen and you will like this CD too."
2,Great buy,My heifer has taken to the pills really well. Lots of growth and showing signs of still growing. Thanks so much!
1,Confusing figures in the book,"The figures are inaccurate or confusing. Like the cis- and trans- prolyl-peptidyl links. If told cofiguration of cis and trans, everyone can draw the figure printed on the book and that provides no information on the 3-D structure at all."
2,A Must Read for all Artists,"What a wonderful book - I go back to it again and again. While ""Art and Fear"" is a great source of information, it is a little dry. I truly enjoy reading ""The Blank Canvas"", because it is a concise and witty source of inspiration. I wish I had read it sooner!"
1,Worked well for 3 months,"This product worked well for 3 months but then suddenly stopped working. I emailed RCA about this and they never responded which is totally unacceptable.So, basically I am out nearly $200 for 3 months use. Due to the limited warranty on this item, if i were to fix it, I would have to pay for the labor. I might as well just buy a replacement! What a ripoff!"
2,Rays Intro Song,"Ok I don't know much about the rest of the CD, but Fishy Fishy Fishy is just classic. The Phillies played this song over the PA during Game 3 of the World Series while introducing the Tampa Bay Rays.Go Phillies!"
2,Great entertainment!,"My 18 month old son loves his Elmo's World Food, Water & Exercise DVD. They are short enough to keep his attention and are education as well. If your child enjoys Elmo, this DVD will be a hit."
1,Poorly Written,"Hard to read, the author injects sloppy humor and anecdotes into the history. Making fun of historical figures, joking about religions and using sentences that are broken up by multiple parentheses.Too bad I didn't read the reviews before I spent the money....There is still some good info there but it's too much hassle to pick out the serious writing from the personal opinions"
2,Nice - The Best I Found - Could Be Nicer Still,"I injured a rib in a doctor's office - yes, yes: I know... Keep laughing; just keep it up...*Annnnyhow* - I started with what I had (several large ACE bandages) and then, as the lovely weeks wore on, decided that it was either something with more padding or the pistol for me, and after some research chose this puppy right'chyar.It was a good purchase; the padding was sufficient...my only complaint is that they might have made it wider, ie _taller_. I found myself adjusting it up and then down again as I tried to get it to cover the entirety of the oh-so-wonderful Busted Rib Goodness. (If you are reading this review, you probably know *EXACTLY* what I mean...) If it was two inches broader and had another half-inch of padding I'd have given the thing SEVEN stars - hell, I'd have married it and written it into my will!"
1,So So book,"I had to read this book for a class and it was a complete waste of my time. The author mixes up the historical facts she tries to highlight as important and does not end the book. It is very clear that this was a first effort and the book had a rookie editor as well.If you don't care about technical details being correct and don't mind a very childish writing style, you should like this book. Just don't expect an ending, because it is not there in any shape or form. And as a bi-racial person who grew up during the times portrayed, I was very very disappointed. As a scholar, I was even more dismayed that this is being passed off as well written."
2,LOVE STEDMAN'S BOOKS,Well worth the price. I love all of the Stedman's books! I have many and they are all great quality!
2,Great for zucchini noodles!,"After going gluten free I missed spaghetti more than anything. The noodles this makes are great. I use about 2-3 zucchini's for two (big eaters) people and after slicing them up on this, Idrop them in boiling water for 3-4 minutes, then take out and immediately run cold cold water over them to stop the cooking. Then I pour the hot spaghetti sauce over them and it's a super quick and super easy gluten free meal that even my (very gluten loving) boyfriend considers one of his favorites! Everyone's happy!"
2,Feelings was my favorite book as a child.,"My mother brought Feelings home for me when I was really young. I brought the book with me to college. I still read it sometimes when I feel like laughing, crying, screaming...and all the other things this wonderful book makes you do."
1,does this book ever end,if you are a college student like me you expect books to get straight to the point..i was assigned to read the book and i had to stop after 40 pages because i had no idea what i had just read..someone should invent cliffs notes for this book..i feel sorry for you if you have to read it!!
1,White Board Peels Off Easily,"After students used white boards for two days, the white boards started separating on the edges and corners. I recomend not to buy this kind of white boards since quality does not match price."
2,A Humdinger of a Book!,"Harlan Coben is a favourite author of mine already. His earlier novels have consistently been clever, witty and generally engrossing stories. But none have showcased Coben's talent for fabricating a brilliant story to the degree of this book. Truly, it is his most intelligently-constructed novel to date. Complex, exciting, and absorbing - I read it in one sitting - till 7 in the morning on a WEEKNIGHT!This book has firmly cemented my interest in this author and I eagerly look forward any new works... I think I may even re-read some of the old ones!Enjoy!"
2,shade,the lens does what it supposed to do. it also came with a shade which costs around $20.00 so a good deal got even better. i am a happy camper.
1,Compass,You get what you pay for - it is good for children to learn but wouldn't recommend it for adult use.
2,Best Acting in a Space Saga,"Any time a movie is made based on a television series, the production faces an additional dilemma: how to bring new viewers up to speed without boring series fans to tears. ""Serenity"" manages to do a fine job, those new to the Firefly saga quickly learn the essential backstory while hardcore fans are still entertained during the formative part of the film. This is no mean feat, given the size of the ensemble cast.The element that sets this movie apart from all the other tales of space and sci-fi on film is the acting. Taking the well-formed and interesting characters created by Whedon, the cast really makes them appealing and identifiable. You feel like you actually known these people and you understand their actions and emotions. Hopefully the surviving cast will have the opportunity to reprise their roles in a sequel or two or three. Much like a couple of other space flick franchises, only better. Much, much better."
2,Writers are perfect for this show,The twists that CM has are great. I love this series. The writers get it. They keep you on edge and brain busy with trying to figure out who the criminal is and how the arrest will play out. It's FANTASTIC ;)
1,Disappointed,"I saw this years ago and remembered it as being quite raunchy, but years on, it's actually quite slow and laborious."
1,Not a reliable item,"I bought this for my kids last year (2005) for Christmas. Within 6 months of gentle use (my kids are not very rough on toys), it no longer worked at all. I do not recommend this product--just get batteries instead."
1,I hate paying money for software that should be free,"See title. Also, takes you to ""out only"" gates in gated communities with no indication of where the entrance is. But I had someone tell me Tom-Tom does the same thing. Often give you wierd directions."
1,Yeah right ...,"Yet another protestant bishop attempts to 'save' Christianity by pandering to the demands of the liberal-left. It won't work Bishop Spong; the liberal-left will continue to hate Christianity no matter how you try to distort it in order to fit their creed of political correctness and so-called tolerance. Incidentally, if traditional faith is dying then how is it that membership of the Catholic Church is now in excess of one billion people worldwide?"
2,Tejano Music,If you love tejano music you'll love this CD. Latinbreed was famous in the 70's and well known. This CD is a collection of some of their many Greatest Hits. Its great music!
1,"Hey man, your dripping.","This movie was the worst I have ever seen. It made no sense what so ever. Boo! is actually about a dead pedophile who molseted a young girl, and killed her. SO the young girl and the pedophile's spirits haunt a mental hospital. The ghosts can take over bodies, but there is one bad side to this, they melt, and blow up. There is one classic scene where the idiot teens are trying to escape the hospital and one guy gets pissed, so we come to find out he is actually a ghost, he starts to melt, so another guy shoots him, and the dude blows up and covers a girl. (The girl that gets slimed screams the rest of the movie, which I couldn't stand.) DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS HORRID THING!!!"
2,The best stop smoking book available.,"I read this book and never lit up again. I was in my first week of quitting already by the time I got my hands on this. I tried to quit at least twenty other times, each time a failure. I feel so good about myself with nine months behind me now. I was a pack a day smoker for thirty five years."
1,Tough on the installation,One of the screws provided was of centered and impossible to use. When using a drill or screw driver it was not easy to atttach the top part to the wall
2,Poetic Horror,"Georges Franju's version of a mad scientist trying to play God tells about a brilliant but controlling and obsessive doctor who is trying to restore the face of his own beloved daughter that was horribly disfigured in a car accident caused by his reckless driving. He requires tissues of recently deceased young women that look like his daughter and he is not going to wait for them to die in an accident - he creates the accidents with help of his loyal secretary/nurse/lover/former patient Louise (Alida Valli of ""The Third Man"") who kidnaps the unsuspecting girls and brings them to the secluded mansion in one of Paris's suburbs where Doctor Génessier is ready to perform the fascinating and horrifying surgeries.""Eyes without a Face"" is a very impressive, classy picture that has inspired many later horror movies. The music by Maurice Jarr adds to the uneasy and creepy atmosphere - it makes you feel like on the never-stopping ominous merry-go-round and you can't get off it."
2,has more hits per cd than usual,"lots of people complain if every song is not a hit but when I look back at my very extensive collection some of the best artists e.g. mariah carey etc had sometimes only one to at most three best songs on the cd. Britney has at least 3 hits on this cd: baby one more time, from the bottom of my broken heart, and I was born to make you happy. Unlike some artists she is not an imitation of another hit artists: so she gets an A for originality. Her voice is really good."
1,Hum Hum,"Sure there are some nice remixed but hey isn't this a James Bond track. I'm sorry but Madonna has probably gone one step to far. Forget about the sex book, forget about Justify my love, all her trashy outfits in the 80's all the lovelives and scandals. nothing can beat this one. The worst bond theme song in history and one of the worst movie songs of all time. She doesn't even sing. A Computer sings for her. The video is boring and not original and this song sounds like a song that is used in a cocoa cola commercial. This is not a bond track and I am no fan of James Bond but I Know great songs when I hear one and this is not it. [...] I used to like her but she is now very overrated and overhyped and exposed [...]."
2,Scary and Suspensful for two-third of the movie length. + Action packed = One of the best movies released on DVD in 2008,"This movie has a lot of scary and suspensful scenes for two-third of the its length. It's full of action from the begining till the end. It's one of the best movies released on DVD in 2008. However, I still think the Predator is still the best movie of the franchise. It's because the suspense never lets up in that film."
1,why do I need to look at a guy in a monkey suit for an hour.,"Alright this is a good plot, with the evolution and the mans destruction by technology. But the director absolutley screwed up. Can somebody say cut. I looked at this guy in a cheap monkey suit for 20 minutes. Nobody should have to do that. the nazis went easier on the jews."
2,Affordable Milk Frother,"Works great every time. This is an affordable way to make a nice latte at home. It's very compact, easy to clean, and can be easily stored in small or tight kitchens. I've paid over $60 for a froth maker 2 years ago that did not even work; however, for less than $20 this one is perfect."
2,I'm Not A Gun - Our Lives On Wednesdays,"Electro-guitar soundscapes: I'm Not A Gun comes through again, this time with their album OUR LIVES ON WEDNESDAYS. Very blissful, very City Centre Offices. ""Walk Through Walls"" brings the guitars to the fore, while the quiet sweeps in ""Off in the Distance"" give that track a haunting quality. ""Sundays Will Never Change"" is beautifully dense, with the guitar shimmering on top of the watery surface like an oil slick, and the glitchy busyness of ""Scenes of Someone Else"" chatters away melodically. Generally, the rhythms here sound more natural, as if produced by actual musicians on actual instruments (although the calmly, looped rhythms of ""Never Meant to Be"" evoke a certain sadness). The organic/electronic mix skews slightly more towards the organic here, but the balance is still well maintained. Electro wins out on the final track, ""Stable Soundwaves,"" but the track keeps morphing, changing shape. Wednesdays have never sounded so good."
2,7-Port USB 2.0 Hub = A Great Buy!,"This 7-port USB hub is independently powered (to decrease drain on your computer power supply). I have had 2 previous hubs, both of which faulted within weeks of purchase. I am completely satisfied with the quality and endurance of this product.In addition, shipping occurred within 2 days!Overall, I am very pleased with this Belkin purchase through Amazon!Malcolm Dayton7-Port USB 2.0 Hub, Black"
1,the most over-rated food magazine,"I subscribed to Food & Wine for a while and was continuously disappointed. The articles are on the superficial side and more importantly a lot of the recipes and product reviews are not as well researched as they should have been. I experienced more than one flop trying their stuff. The magazine tries very hard to be trendy and pick up the latest and greatest in the cooking and restaurant scene without being careful enough in deciding what is actually an important or meaningful trend rather than a fad. This magazine can't hold a candle to ""Bon Appetit"" or ""Gourmet""."
2,nicely done,"I agree with the others that this is perhaps the best written book in the series so far. We get to see very intimately how Kindred interact with mortals. Hesha, the Setite that the story revolves around, is constantly referred to as a ""monster"" and yet acts so very gentlemanly... we find out in the end what he truly is, just as Liz, our hero, finds out.This story does in fact stand alone but it does tie into the larger story, adding some rather frightening details that seem to be almost glossed over. Keep your eyes open."
1,Waste of money,Difficult to keep in place and not effective.It appears by how it looks in the photo to be a fine soft to use product but it is not.
1,the dreamcatcher,i didn't like the story at all iam not a big fan of scary moviesi felt that the book was very confusing it had you going back and forth from the past to present then back to the past again. i give the book one thumb down.
1,Rainy Days make for a Dreary Read,"I usually can't put a Ruth Rendall novel down once I start it but it was not the case here. The beginning of the novel starts out with a strange religious ritual of some type leaving you wondering what is about to occur. It isn't until much later that you discover the purpose of it which I found very confusing. I also didn't like the side story about Inspector Wexford's daughter which seemed to be a filler since the story was so weak about the missing baby sitter and the two children she was watching who suddenly disappear without a trace. Also, the constant rain and flooding was a strange backdrop which again seemed like words to fill up the pages without a real purpose to the story.As always, her characters are always very unusual with some type of dark background. This was the only strong part to me. The babysitter and her cougarish ways was the most interesting part of the story. Overall, I recommend staying away from the book. YOu will be disappointed."
1,Sent Wrong Battery,"This is the battery I wanted but did not get:Nickel-Metal Hydride Cordless Phone Battery For Uniden BT-446But this is the one I got and it doesn't fit at all:GE Cordless Phone Battery for Panasonic/Uniden Phones (TL26154)I would like to have the real one but how do I get it?Thanks,Roland HiltscherSenior Citizen on Social Security"
2,Duma -- A Wonderful Coming of Age Story,"I orginally thought that this was a child's movie and my child did thoroughly enjoy it, but I did too. This is a film for adults as well as kids. It is very well written, well acted and a beautifully filmed. This movie will make you laugh, make you cry, and inspire you. Do yourself a favor and view this remarkable little gem!"
2,EMPOWERING!!,"I bought this book for my ten year old daughter and she finished it in about a day. I then read it to her, with the feeling it demanded. It is a very powerful book that speaks to the heart of girls. It is encouraging, funny, empowering and very, very positive. I plan to buy two more copies and give them to my best friend and sister. Even we adults could use some nurturing to the girl within us. Every girl should have this book and every mother should read it with/to her!!"
1,Not what I was expecting for Bio,"On the Bio Channel on TV, you're given a full biography about the person/people they're telling you about. For some reason this DVD focuses around The Tony Danza Show and all the promotions that went into getting it on TV. Being a huge Who's the Boss fan, I was expecting a lot more to revolve around THAT show and the actors and actresses that starred on it. If I had known what this DVD was really about--his talk show--I would have skipped it. You watch the Bio channel to learn about the person--their childhood, how they got into acting, what their colleagues think about them, their acting career. You don't want to focus on such a small part of the person's life, especially when there were so much better thing they could have zeroed in on. They barely mentioned Who's the Boss at all. I was disappointed. I don't recommend this DVD at all."
1,Total Garbage,"This guy has an axe to grind (but without a true cause) and his outlook on the mormon church is CLEARLY askew. I am a lifelong catholic and have lived near 2 Mormon families for most of my life. We have talked at length regarding their views several times since I have known them and I can tell you this: Mr. Bennett's opinions (though he states them as fact), could not be further from the truth. Did you get your poor feelings hurt by a mormon Mr. Bennett?... or were you just interested in making a dishonest buck?If you want to know what a mormon really believes you could just ask one of them. As in all religions, I'm sure you have good mormons and bad ones, but generally I have found that they are extremely kind and genuine group of Christian people. And their beliefs are NOT as Bennett says they are."
2,"AudioBahn 600t 6.5"" seperates",Sweeter than Creamed Korn: My spare ribs too... My wife had a lot to say about the time I have spent with them.
1,I don't like this cd that much.. I think I lose my money!,"Well, well.This is what I think. If you wanna have a good cd, I think this is not the most correct cd to buy.I bought this cd because I heard in a interview about her cd and I thouhgt this may be good, but I was a little wrong.The think was that... how she can said that if the people don't like her clothes and what she is wearing, they don't need to look at her? that's so wrong, I mean what about childrens who watch her, is not fear that they must see her appearing like that.If she wasn't such b%@#%$, well the people would put more attention about her real voice, because she has the voice, but not the personality..And how about the pearcings and the picture or Rolling Stone Magazine.What we show is what the people learn from us."
1,This movie adaptation makes a great novel choppy and confusing,"I really enjoyed the novel ""Love in the Time of Cholera"", but like so many adaptations, this film version comes off as choppy and confusing. The movie is beautifully shot, full of exotic sets and beautiful people, but the wonderful story gets jumbled and lost in all of the majesty. I was fully confused by the end of this movie, even though I had read the book!"
2,Amazing............,Drew Barrymore stood out most definatly in this movie! I loved it so much! Everyone should go see it!
1,Not as good as other titles on the subject,"After reading three books on the general subject of body language, including ""The Definitive Book of Body Language"" by Pease, ""What Every BODY is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent's Guide to Speed-Reading People"" by Navarro, and this book, I can say that this book did nothing to enhance my understanding of the subject matter. The other two books are worthwhile. This book is slightly too vague and general to be of any practical use. Taken together with other books on the subject, it adds nothing of value."
2,Triathlon Training by Eric Harr,"This book is motivating, encouraging and is preparing us well for our upcoming triathlon. It was highly recommended by a friend who competes in multiple triathlons and has been a jewel."
1,gross cookies,"When I eat junk food, I'd like to enjoy it, the guilty pleasure it is.These cookies are neither healthy or tasty. Stick to Chewy Chocolate Chip cookies."
2,A good year,"I had read some of the terrible reviews this movie received, so I was somewhat surprised to enjoy A Good Year as much as I did. Russell Crowe manages to be quite charming when he's not throwing phones at bellboys, and he makes his character if not exactly likeable, which would have been impossible, then at least compelling. Marion Cotillard, Abbie Cornish and the great Albert Finney make a good supporting cast."
2,Whew - it's Still Hot!,"Ms. Murray is today's Kathleen Woodiwiss. Hot romance, suspenseful plots, and great characters. Try this series - you'll love it."
2,I Liked this album A LOT,"I found this album (the twilight one, wich stands for the CD02) very good, indeed. Some lounge/house tracks, wich make you want to dance, bute still in a light speed. CD01 is slowlyier, but also nice."
1,Yawn....Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..... (sleeping),"Despite the constant screams and attempts to be loud, I found myself falling asleep listening to this last year. Enough said."
1,STRUCTURAL STEEL DRAFTING,Amazon messed up the shipping address and Zip Code I never received the product.Instead of contacting me I got an automatic message they were refunding my money.
1,A real Lack of Information,"I bought this book for class at my technical college. Although mine was a second edition it read like an unrevised draft, edited only for grammatical errors. The inside cover even lists objectives for the Server 2003 exam, not the XP pro. exam. I took the 70-270 exam yesterday and earned a 610. About 30% of the questions pertained to information that this book either never mentions or does not cover adequately. Questions asked at the end of the chapters are frequently worded poorly or can't be answered using the book. Don't waste any more time looking at this book or this review, go back and choose something that has positive reviews. I went to the bookstore and browsed their XP pro. books after the exam. The difference was night and day!"
1,An empty husk.,"I started this DVD with high expectations but didn't get very far I'm afraid. Maybe I should have stuck it out. I imagine its target audience is the nonbeliever who doesn't know anything about Christianity but has a historical curiosity. The work is certainly put out by nonbelievers - skeptics who have trouble believing the Bible and at the same time are trying to explain the most pivotal event in the history of mankind, namely the entry of the Christ of God into time and space. When I saw the little heretic, Dominique Crossan, interviewed over and over again I knew I had a turkey on my hands. The story of Peter and Paul is a great story, but without the power of belief the film isn't half as uplifting, awesome, inspiring , joyous and powerful as it could have been."
1,It was good while it lasted...............,"Purchased this TV in late 2004, and a year and a half later, it doesn't turn on. Maybe it's me, but I expect more out of my technology. I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. I don't believe I'll be purchasing any Philips products in the future. The price has declined to a point that a repair just does not seem justified. Can any one recommend a good TV manufacturer?"
2,The Biggest Band in The World,"When i first heard UP (1998), i did not love it. It took time and i had to listen carefully, before i really ""got it"".I heard ""Reveal"" , and was inspired. it is quite simply, better than Automatic For The People. The lyrics are pleasurable to uncover, and the melodic, moving sound of Mills and Buck really finding themselves again.REM have had some tough times, if we are honest, since Monster (1994). I was desparate to return to the genius we first saw in Murmur (1981). But with the Band becoming Father-like figures and Stipes foray into movie production, it was bleak for time.Now, with Reveal, they have made an album truly trying not to compete with Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach, or any contemporary american band.The are simply better than anyone else, the biggest band in the world, reflected and revealed again."
2,A classic Basie L.P.,"I had purchased the original Clef album over 30 years ago. The C.D. sounds great, and is an important part of the Basie legacy. Thanks Amazon"
1,Garbage BluRay Disc,"I don't even use BD-Live; yet they produced this so 2.0 version players require a minimum memory for this feature, and if you don't have it then you can't play this disc at all. Yet older players, that aren't BD-Live compatible, can play this no problem. I suggest getting the DVD if you really want this movie and just deal with the up conversion."
1,Slight Disappointment,"Though these fit well, I was very unhappy to find that only one pair has the design I wanted. The other are just plain white. Probably won't buy more."
2,IT BROKE!...But It's Still Great,"I just recently purchased the Red Variant of this figure and was excited and pleased to have both a nice looking action figure as well as the piece of Apocalypse. But as I was setting him up, trying to move his leg it just snapped off at the hip joint. Hence the 2 star durability rating. I have never had this problem with the Legends line before, and was very disappointed, especially since it was the variant figure. Some superglue fixed the problem, but at the cost of some articulation. He is on my shelf now and looks great, but if you're giving the toy to younger children, be cautious. Like I said I have never had any problems like this with a Marvel Legends Figure before, so hopefully it was just a fluke.The figure is still well worth getting, and in fact I am going to pick up the Green version sometime in the near future."
1,Go figure?,"The day I purchased the book, I made an address change with Amazon. I guess the Thriftstore never did get the address change, because I never did get the book."
1,American Nightmare,"Perhaps one of the worst movies ever made. For a comedy, I only laughed perhaps twice in two hours. I thought it would be a funny send up of American Idol. It wasn't. But it was painfully slow, dull, and boring, and perhaps that's why a week after it opened there were only 10 people in the entire theatre besides the three of us. Dennis Quaid wasn't funny, Hugh Grant wasn't funny, and really I wish I had left and asked for a refund. It's amazing how a movie like that can make it to the screen. I would have done better to watch Dave again with Kevin Kleine. This movie was an American travesty from start to finish!"
2,Fantastic!,"I have extremely fine hair! I wouldn't curl my hair more than once a year because my hair gets damaged so easily. These steam curlers are amazing!! They absolutely positively will not damage your hair! I'm still getting the technique down as sometimes my curls come out a bit funky looking. I definitely don't get curls that last for days... but it lasts just as long, if not a bit longer than if I used a curling iron."
2,Fabulous!!,I am glad I bought two. One for my car and one for my office chair.Very much worth the price!!
1,Disney's ham-fisted marketing RUINS this DVD,"If you don't like being maniuplated by Disney, which forces you to sit through an endless stream of promotional garbage, then AVOID this DVD. Paying for this will only encourage other studios to start treating their customers like sheep who can be forced to watch anything in the name of ""marketing."""
2,Best Chocolate truffle!,"This book has the recipe for the Best Chocolate truffle, they were easy and tasted scrumptious. Thanks Gale"
2,Inexpensive,These are very inexpensive. They are lightweight and I have had a few come apart at the joint. I would probably try to get a bit heavier weight plastic next time.
2,Covers all of the aspects of the lives of birds,"Although small in size, this book covers all the aspects of the lives of birds. Everything from nesting to migration. There's more to birding than just identification, and this book is a good start for that step beyond. Also has good illustrations. Recommended."
1,Godawful,"Though released in 1981, this seems horribly dated today, with the male leads all but invisible and the storyline unsure whether to be a comedy or a drama. It's neither. It's just plain awful. The two women, Candace Bergen and Jacqueline Bisset have zero chemistry, so why they are lifelong friends is a mystery here. Mostly they scream at each other in supposed jealous rages over their careers and men. Made by a Hollywood dinosaur, George Cukor, this one is of use only as a curiosity piece. I found it agonizing."
1,way too boring,"seriously this movie put me to sleep....confusing, odd...all over the place...too bad the preview had me...thought it was going to be fast paced....just wasn't"
2,Great book!!,"I disagree with the previous reviewers. I thought the book was as good as Flyy Girl. I especially loved the incorporation of poetry throughout the book.Tracy was not boring as an adult; she just grew up! She even motivated me to continue pursuing my goals, because life is what you make it!"
1,Not an enjoyable read.,I felt compelled to read this book straight through after a friend recommended it to me on several occasions. I can't see what all the praise is for. The story was sad and depressing and the writing was so . . . boring. The characters are so full of themselves - annoying people I would avoid like the plague at a party. The last chapter or two has an interesting twist and a few phrases worthy of reading twice - but much too late to redeem this novel.
2,Great tracks but rough in some spots...,"It seems that Sander's mixing is consistent with his NuBreed compliation- I was thoroughly blown away by NuBreed's first disc, with its fluid mixing and impecable track selection. Disc two however left much to be desired. The same can be said about Everybody as some moments are sheer brilliance while others seem mediocre. For instance, the second disc is mixed brilliantly mixed up until My Memory, which is an outstanding record but loses some of its luster after an unimpressive mix out of Therapy. Also, 2 Bags of Grass seems tacked on and out of place on the disc. Overall this is a phenomenal CD that really highlights his talent as a DJ and producer, despite the rough patches."
1,Not another Chicken Soup,In no way did this book compare to chicken soup. The storieswere short and meaningless. The people who wrote this book must nothad ever been teens or they would have know that any teen it's right mind would not enjoy this book. Don't waste you money on this book. Buy Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul 1 and/or 2. Because taste Berries for Teens just taste sour.
2,Book in Excellent condition. Received in timely manner.,Great book for PE teachers.Fun ideas and very practical for small and large groups of children.The kids in my class have loved the games
1,A lot of soup.,"Don't waste your money.Not so much beans.Mainly a cup of broth. No substance, just wanna be.Just pass."
1,Don't Release Head Colds,"I simply cannot listen to the track of Forest Murmurs by Wagner which I downloaded through Amazon because there are so many people coughing loudly during the soft beginning. This track should never have been released! It's played well enough, but to release this recording is irresponsible; the incessant coughing totally ruins the listening experience. I haven't heard the rest of the album and am not likely to because of this totally insensitive action."
2,An excellent book to learn ABAP,"The explanation of the ABAP syntax and commands is good. Even if you are experienced in ABAP, I guess there's something in the book that you do not know and is worth a perusal. It would have been better if the author would have included BDC, Dynpros also."
2,No complaints,Bought it for my husband. Works pretty well. No complaints. Good deal for the money. Would recommend for a starter piece.
1,Warning : picture may not match actual product,"I ordered this item because the picture showed a 90-degree male plug (a plug with an L-bend). However, what I received was a male plug with a straight plug instead. When I contacted the company they apologized for the using an outdated photo (that was the middle of September 2010) but they said that the written description of the product never actually mentioned any 90-degree bend... They offered me the option of returning it but frankly the return shipping cost would have been at least a third or a half of the product cost which just didn't make it worth my time to do. Maybe I'll find a use for it somewhere.I just wish they'd update their photo appropriately."
2,Waking Norman- One of The GREATS,"I've watched this band throughout the years...have followed and loved all of their music...incredibly talented group with unique song writing ability, instrumental talents and overall just a very unique sound. I don't understand why they haven't struck it huge...I hope they never stop making music. It would be a crime if that were to happen. Purchase this C.D...I promise you will not be disappointed--its the kind of music/band you want to share with the whole world!"
2,Sheetrock Miricle!,"I am the world's absolute worst at taping and mudding sheetrock. I hate it and it hates me back! These sponges are simply amazing! They make my work look good and do so in short order. The square edges make my disaster inside corners straight with ease, all the glops of mud and tool mark just disappear ... its magic. I'd give these things ten stars out of a possible five."
2,Sticks to the stories,"I'm not an avid reader, but someone recommended this book to me. It was easy to read and Ms. Hill didn't go off on stuff like so many authors do. As it was, I missed a detail here and there, but I liked the story very much. I especially like Hannah."
1,Pure Waste of Money,"Absolute junk. AFS system does not work. I have to manually refeed the line. I have not had the patience to complete edging my yard during the course of a single day because I spend greater than 50% time popping off the spool cap and manually refeeding the line. It takes about an hour to edge 150 feet, because the line breaks and needs to be manually refed every 1 to 3 minutes. Please don't buy this."
2,good seller. Fast and as advertised,These are great bags. Howver if you are really tall they may be to short for Jackets but great for pants ans shirts.
2,Easily One of The Best Networking Books I've Ever Read!,"It is my pleasure to endorse, without reservation, Ken Marsh's book ""Fearless Networking."" Each year the Houston Business Show endorses a handful of books as the best for business. It is safe to say this timely book will be on that list. It is empathetic, diagnosing the barriers to successful networking and helping the reader overcome such. It is practical, giving the reader step by step approaches to being successful. It is encouraging. Everyone who reads will feel able to succeed. It is easily one of the best networking books I've ever read. If you are in sales, buy it. If you are a sales manager, buy many! This is the book you and your team have needed. Thank you for letting me read your great book!Kevin Price,Host,Houston Business Show, AM 650Publisher of Houston Business Review"
1,Not his best effort,"I didn't fall in love with this effort by Jobim. The orchestral arrangements are a tad cliche and more than a tad predictable. The mix is off throughout much of the album and jobim's tired scatting gets swallowed up in the constant over-dramatized string crescendos. Between the bad mix, cliche arrangements, and raspy and unenthusiastic scat lines, the whole thing comes off sounding like an experiment with a karaoke machine."
2,This is a good book for first graders,I think this book is good. Junie B. Jones loses her mittens andtries to find out what happened to them. She finds out who has them. But does she get them back? Read to find out!
1,overrated,"I watched this movie because all of my friends said, ""you just have to see Napoleon Dynamite"". So I caved in and watched with a few of my friends. I have to say that this movie didn't even come close to living up to my expectations. In my opinion there were maybe one or two funny bits in the movie, but that's it. And the part that I hated the most was that if you took the scenes that actually had something to do with the plot, this movie would have been about 15 minutes long. The main character was genuinely unlikable and painful to watch. If I had to see this movie again I would probably drop alot of acid first, then I might be able to enjoy it. MAYBE!"
2,Love the Kinks,I had this album back in the day. Hell I think that I saw this tour of America. 'Round the Dial still sounds great and Better Things is one of my favorite songs all time. Great album
1,Nothing to pull me in to want to keep reading.,The events in the story are so far fetched and seem to occur just to keep the story dragging on. The romance seems a little immaturely written. The book does not flow very well (very choppy). I had a hard time finishing it.
1,Doesn't Hang together,"I've been a student of ""A Course in Miracles"" for along time, and hoped that this work would give me some perhaps additionalinsight. It does not, and does not represent ""A Course in Miracles"". What it does seem to do is trivialise the great teachings given in the course and to express Ken Wapnicks interpretation of the course, through two so-called ""Ascended Masters"" -the tapesof these meetings being conveniently destroyed!If you want areal interpretation and help with the course, I would strongly suggest reading ""Path of Light"" by Robert Perry."
1,commercial band!,"Led Zep was a good band, but this cd is becoming very commercial. I like hard rock music but not like this compilation! because many fans'd already owned the original Lp's."
1,Pretty Lame,"The writer is decent but in this particular novel, he didn't seem much like he cared about it. This novel is based in South Carolina about a family that has never met their father's relatives but something causes them to leave their home in Connecticut (where the father's life has been planted for at least twenty years & his wife, plus 2 children know of nowhere else to call home) They arrive, meet the relatives, things happen & even more things happen but the novel just lacks any depth. The only interesting 1 is the killer. The characters are one dimensional...I will tell you that it does read like a bad-horror-flick."
1,unusable,"if you lie sideways, the bulky construction of it disturbs you. also because of it touching the pillow, gaps opens and light leaks inside. if you lie on your back, now the rough velcro fastened belt is disturbing back of your head. don't even think about sleeping on your chest"
2,Wow! What a great read.,I've been reading Ms. Kingsolver for years now but this book convinces me that she's writing on a whole new level. I loved the narrative structure: chapters written in first person from the point of view of a different daughter. Each daughter is well drawn and very different from the other three. I could not put this book down and stayed up late two nights in a row to finish it. I wish they had more than 5 stars that I could give!
2,Keep This Book On Your Desk,"From the basics to advanced details, this book covers it all. This is like a college degree packaged cover-to-cover. The book provides:-- Worksheets.-- Sample forms.-- Ways to detect and solve issues.-- Instruction on how to deal with foreign currency.-- Ways to monitor cash flow.And so much more information that this book should have a permanent spot on your desk for easy reference. If you own a new business, established business, or work as a bookkeeper, this guide is a must have.James GartonAuthor of 25 Ways to Make Money Online"
2,A Writer's Read,"This work was written to be read by a writer. Reminiscent of William Faulkner in that non-linear fashion of writing; this novel jumps around... a lot! The story is overall interesting and meaningful. I agree that it is primarily a love story supported with strange ideals of the impact of time travel. However, I most highly suggest this to writers. Because, this work shows how to eloquently move amongst various speaker platforms with tremendous ease. Really, I found that in itself, thrilling, and worth the effort to drown myself in the work."
1,are you kidding me with this crap?,"Ok First off the plastic case this tool came in came in 2 pieces literally. the tool itself, i tried to use to open a spring washer not on a car but a dryer. The tips that came on it bent, i really thought users were over exaggerating about .the quality being that poor: They were not. I have never received such a p.o,s. tool IN MY LIFE, I have never left a negative comment on amazon before, but this toy/tool is worthless."
1,To big around,This product shouldn't be sold as it can rip a woman wide open I don't care how much lub you use people don't buy this
2,Yay Jane,"I've watched the movie(s) over and over but have never read the book until now.I knew what was going to happen, and still I couldn't put it down.I will be reading it again."
1,One-sided and ill-informed,"In the ""war on drugs"" most people take one of two fairly radical positions: either drugs are evil and should be completely banned, or are wonderful and don't really do much harm. Both positions are usually very poorly informed. I bought this book hoping to find a well-informed, balanced look at drugs. Unfortunately, this is another poorly informed, biased take by someone who obviously knows little about drugs aside what one could learn from a decent encyclopedia. It is decidedly anti-drug, and completely fails to examine why people would choose to use drugs. Edwards provides plenty of anti-drug statistics, but, when lacking legitimate backing, also reverts to anecdotes and unfounded generalizations to reach his conclusions that governments should do everything in their power to outlaw and discourage use of all drugs excepting caffeine. If you want decent information and any semblance of balance, look elsewhere."
1,Cannot be used,"I'm quite frustrated. This version is a nightmare. It is impossible to go to different short-stories as every single link within a collection leads you to the BEGINNING of the collection not of the story you are looking for. Moreover, you cannot use the search-function here. I deleted this version after half an hour of stabbing at buttons."
2,RYLIE'S DRESS UP CLOTHES,MY GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER NOW HAS ALL OF THE PRINCESS PRODUCTS. SHE LOVES THEM AND SHE HAS A WONDERFUL PRETEND PLAY MIND.
1,breaks down fast,"I wanted to love this unit. Filtratrion/price was excellent by the books. But first, the green light that's supposed to change to red when it's time to change the filter never did anything but blink green. Then the automatic return to unfiltered water switch stopped working, but that was OK to switch back and forth manually. Then, the cartridges didn't last as long as they were supposed to - beware the expensive razor blade. Finally, the thing started spewing little streams of pressurized water out the back and sides of the cartidge. Hope I can find a decent unit elsewhere, I'm done with this one. It did do a good job of filtering the water though."
2,It's Boston...what more do you have to say?,"This is probably my least favorite of their albums, but it's still excellent and still Boston."
1,Flimsy,"Pretty flimsy. They worked for my first trip, but would not hold air the second time I used them. None of the three. Very cheaply made."
2,hilarious,*insert ass joke here* this game is fun and hilarious! One of the better family games out right now! Love.
1,eh,this product is just ok.... it is slightly moisturizing but doesnt help wrinkles or fine lines. Ive been using it about 6 months and i dont see any real difference. Its just eh... i wouldnt purchase it again
2,Excellent,"Words can't describe how powerful this book is-because it's true! Everybody should read this and compare it to their own lives, society as a whole and to the future. It can change peoples lives..."
2,one of the best on about Love,i bought this one as gift...many people around me recommand this book as one of the best books about Love.
1,Ja Drool,"Ja Drool is what this guy should be called. You can't understand what he is talking about, which is the case with most rap. Ja Rule..., Rap ....I don't recommned this album, infact I don't recommend any rap albums, namely Ja Rule and Nelly as I can't stand those two guys.If you want to listen to good music go listen to Rock and you'll see that this so called ""rap"" should not even be classified as music"
1,Things aren't what they seem,"I felt tricked!! Amazon never published the battery capacity. I bought them thinking they were 2400 mAh (by the model), but THEY WERE 750mAh!!!! I don't know if Duracell doesn't want to publish it because i coudn't find the capacity in every page that sell them. Things aren't what they seem. Arrggh!!"
1,Watch out! This diet actually increased my carb cravings!,"Watch out for this diet. The low-carb breakfasts and lunches (the recommended times for the low-carb meals) made me crave carbs even more--all day long--and I loaded up at dinner. After being on it for about a month, I stopped, because it felt like I was screwing up my system. Watch out for diets that say you can ""eat anything you want, for an hour"" every day. There is no miracle diet for anyone; and this one proved to me that moderation is the key. (And, years later, I still have a problem with craving carbs--which I attribute to the fact that I ""deprived"" myself of them while on this diet--even for that short period of time.) Plus, I've always wondered how it could be a good thing to load up on fat. . .isn't this contrary to everything we've read about the connection between fat and heart disease?"
1,just doesn't work!,"This Sunbeam Timer hasn't worked since I received it. I thought that a simple mechanical timer was preferable to the array of fancy digital ones that don't last, but I was obviously wrong."
2,Adorable and dainty earrings,These earrings are 20mm in length so they are fairly small. They look beautiful with well cut quartz that sparkle against 14k yellow gold. I think I would find a lot of use for them as they can be used for everyday wear. I would definitely recommend them as long as you are aware of the true length.
1,Didn't regenerate my organ!,"Recently we moved from our walk-up penthouse apartment to new digs in the city. Tragically, the clumsy movers (Two Oafs and a Truck) dropped my beloved Kimball 800 Swinger in the 7th floor stairwell. My prized organ was in pieces spread between the 5th and 6th floors, with some of the loose keys trickling all the way down to the lobby. Three years later I was still waiting for the moving company's insurance check when I spotted the Guardian Angel on Amazon. Perfect! I bought two just to be safe. I put them in the box with the organ pieces and shook it up real good. However, even after waiting a few days, there was no improvement in the organ's condition. I don't know - perhaps they are brand specific and I got Wurlitzer models?"
2,80's Straight Edge Classic,"This album is outstanding from beginning to end. I would argue that Minor Threat was the best 80's hardcore punk band, outshining their contemporaries like Black Flag and Youth of Today by a decent margin. The music, aided by Fugazi's unrelenting idealism and straight edge ethos, is uncompromising and distilled. Punk doesn't come anymore pure or potent than this. This is the real deal as opposed to the [stuff] that populated MTV and the airwaves during the ""alternative"" 90's."
2,I fell in love,"I wasn't quite sure about this book when I first started reading it, but as I understood more of the story I ended up really loving this book! It takes you places you've never been before, and I love thinking about the concept of gods in an American way, with our values and culture superimposed on an ancient belief system. Makes you think very closely about your way of life. I do recommend it."
2,Very good performance at an attractive price.,These speakers replaced small 25-year old Bose speakers that were beginning to fail. Very clean highs and mid-range and plenty of bass for a small living room. Flat across the spectrum (to my ear).
2,The Show Must Go On....,"The War in the Nightside is over and who's still around? Our hero John Taylor who must be indestructible. It's business as usual for John who has been hired by the Nightside's resident immortal, the Griffin. John's quest? Find the Griffin's grand-daughter. Oh, but there's a catch: John's gift isn't working correctly! It's never easy in the Nightside.If you've read my reviews of this series, you know I'm in love with the Nightside. Simon R. Green has such a rich imagination and is able to translate those ideas into books that are very easy to read. I read every single word in this book while sometimes I skim past useless descriptions in other books. Green's descriptions are so vivid it's hard not to visualize the Nightside. I have not been disappointed by the other Nightside books and I'm certainly not disappointed this time! BUY THIS BOOK. Even if you haven't read the rest of the Nightside books, this one can stand alone. YOU MUST READ THIS SERIES. Period."
2,The cover sucks,"the handheld is great, light, many features, the camera is ok ( for quick photos), but the problem is the megas, only 32, and the cover sucks..."
2,Good alternative to live class,"A real live class is best, but this cd and booklet works very well as an alternative if you can't get to a real live class."
1,"This is Moonraker, not original stuff.","Yes, I know they already made a film of ""Moonraker"" which had basically nothing to do with the book, so they're free to use plot elements. But it's almost shameless to use this many plot elements. A space weapon (only it's called ""Icarus"" instead of ""Moonraker""), a ""zero-to-hero"" public persona for the villain (as well as his being honored by the Queen and not at all what he seems), the villain's blonde secretary who's a double (British S.S. and his secretary), a showdown at a club...I could go on and on. Why waste $$$ on this novelization when you could pick up Ian Fleming's original ""Moonraker"" at a library or used book store? It's much better, plus you get to see a ""Bond Girl"" who thinks he's stupid (at least at first, but then SHE dumps HIM). How rare is that!?"
2,19th C. Girl Power!,"An amazing percent of my college class, now approaching our 50th Reunion, had read this book as children and loved it. I've recently reread it and found it still terrific. Its subject is a young French orphan girl, stranded without resources other than her own creativity, hard work and moral sensibilities. She makes do and becomes a shining example to everyone. She wins over a stubborn grandfather who has rejected her parents without knowing that the heroine of the book is his only grandchild. Her ability to work with many kinds of people, and to make a life for herself despite enormous difficulties speaks to many girls today. The plot may be a little dated, but the language is vivid, the plot full of action, and the heroine memorable!"
2,"Honestly, one of Aerosmith's Greatest Works","Can you imagine having an artist's greatest hits in one CD? Well, Big Ones is a fine example of one. I am a huge Aerosmith Fan, and I think that Big Ones is their best work. Big Ones contains their hit singles and other great, unreleased songs. I can't say that I have a favorite song in this Album, because it is truely extraordinary. When I hear this CD, I just press play let go on and on.If you've never heard of Aerosmith before, or if you're a true Aerosmith fan, I recommend you this CD. I guarantee you that you will not be dissapointed."
2,The beginning of the end...,"Yes, I am another Pre-Steve Perry fan. This was not their best effort of the three, but it is worth checking out. I particularly enjoy I would Find You with Neil demonstrating his vocal chops. Very much enjoyed seeing them live at Winterland. I wish their was a video of these shows. I loved them!I don't resent Steve Perry, I just wish he came along with a different band and not the the original group. He brought with him Pop sensibility and a path to huge financial success. The musical chops don't match the financial success in my opinion."
2,Great Company,"Book came in great condition! And the company accidentally sent me a paperback, when I ordered a hardcover, so they sent me the hardcover anyway and let me keep the paperback. I was extremely happy with this company!"
1,Wellllllllll. . . .,"Wow. I didn't know a movie could be so stupid, honestly. I tried to pay close attention to the mind numbing movie, but I couldn't for the life of me find a plot. The movie had no action at all until about a half an hour left in it. It was absolutely terrible. Mary Kate and Ashley usually turn out at least decent movies, but this one was truly the worst I've ever seen. It basically looked like the girls decided they wanted to go to the Bahamas and have the camera crew film them while they had fun. There was hardly any acting and what there was of it wasn't all that great. The ""parents"" part was definitely way too corny. Overall, it was incredibly disappointing."
1,The Force is not strong with these ones,These prequels were a monstrosity. No need for them in any format. One big CGI nightmare filled with plot holes and morning wood acting. No soul. Lucas should have moved on. Worse day in the history of cinema was when Georgie boy discovered a computer.
1,Good book-missing it's jacket,"This was a very interesting book, however I was disappointed that it came without the book jacket. Although I purchased it used, I planned to have it autographed by the author, so it was frustrating to not have it come with the jacket."
1,Great Book Marred By An Absolutely Terrible Introduction,"If you buy this book, dive straight into the Twain works themselves and completely skip the introduction which contains such inane and unintelligible howlers as ""Mark Twain has proved to be a one book author"" and ""every reader of Huckleberry Finn feels that the end of the novel is artistically mismanaged"" and ""Mark Twain's difficulties in writing the fully articulated novel consonant with the mood into which his mature experience had precipitated him are most evident in the construction of his eponymous hero.""I have no idea who R.D. Gooder is, but all I can say is that I am glad I did not have any literature professors like him. Stick with the unadulterated versions of Twain such asThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Cambridge World Classics) Special Kindle Enabled Features (Mark Twain Collection)andThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Cambridge World Classics Edition) Special Kindle Enabled Features (Mark Twain Collection)"
2,Diving sleeping bag pretty and affordable,"My 10 year old daughter likes the sleeping bag very much. It is comfortable for sleepovers and does fine for camping out with a foam pad underneath, like most other sleeping bags. She likes the smooth satin material, although it is so slippery the bag tends to unroll itself in spite of the sewn in tethers to keep it rolled."
1,What the hell!,"This tablet worked one day for me, and now it doesn't even come on. I uninstalled it three times and my computer will not even notice it when I plug it in the usb port. Now I have to get a new one but I am getting a more expensive one so I know it will work."
2,A must have,"A charge station is a must-have for Wii owners. I didn't give this item 4 stars because you have to remove the straps to charge the remotes. We purchased one of these a few years ago and ruined it trying to place the remotes on the stand with the straps attached. Other than that, no problems."
2,"Very, very happy!","I was very, very happy with this purchase. I received the book quickly and it was in the condition stated. I would definitely buy from this seller again:) Nicolette"
2,This is a timeless master piece,I've had this for about 5yrs and have never tired of it. The range of songs are incredible from mellow to medal. From folk to blues. If you have a passion for music this is a must have!
1,Great music bad mp3,"I think this music is wonderful and my rating actually goes towards the mp3 aspect of this music. If I had to rate the music i would give it a 4 maybe 5 star rating. The Mp3 quality, however, is really bad. I had this cd once long ago and loved it, I saw it was for download on amazon and thought, why not? Well all the songs skip pretty bad and I wouldn't recommend downloading this as an Mp3, I would just go ahead and spend the extra few dollars and buy the cd."
1,Not for large dogs at all!!,"1st off, a large dog is not 60 pounds. I am sick and tired of large being refered to 40-60 pound dogs to make their wuss owners feel more happy about their owning a medium sized dog. I have two Rotties. This Kong football lasted literally 45 seconds with my male. 45 seconds!? I looked at the toys for ""dogs"" at Petco, and other pet stores locally. I ended up purchasing this toy from Tractor Supply due to my successful purchasing, and lasting durability of other kong toys I have. My dog not only stripped the tennis material off it within seconds, he bit clean through it like it was made out of wax. I would not reccommend this or any other kong air squueaker. HOWEVER, the red solid rubber ball from Kong has lasted longer than a tractor tire that I bought months ago. He tore the tire apart (not steel belts!!!), but the red kong ball is still here!"
2,Great book,Wow I love this book I am reading it now and i think i will read it a million more times! There really is a lot of power in this book. It is very eye opening and helpful to know just how to pray for my beloved husband.
2,Bad parenting,"I liked this film without doubt, but I confess I was appalled at the bad parenting showed in this movie. How can a parent allow her teenage daughter to date a much older man? Maybe it was normal for the 60's, but in these times, such a thing is considered a no-no. She was besotted, seduced and fooled in the same way I was predicting she was going to be. In the end, I felt sorry for her, but...she learned her lesson.Good performances. Mulligan's facial expressions are lovely and she deserved to be nominated for an Oscar. Loved the clothes, hairstyles, decoration belonging to the era.Even though the end was somewhat predictable, it is a good movie and I recommend it to every teenage girl who thinks she is too smart and deserves something better. Don't try to grow up so quickly. Enjoy your age and be grateful."
1,poor service,I used the SB600 two times and was only able to use it for 15-20 pictures per set of batteries. The third time I used the flash it would not even turn on. After examining it close there was corrosion on the battery terminals even though my batteries have always been brand new. I have feeling that I may have been sent a used flash that someone else maybe returned since it was messed up even though I ordered a new one. So I guess this could be more of a customer service complaint than anything (since they wont do anything about it but said they could give me refund of 50% - 80% on what I paid. All I know is that the flash is only 2 months old and it doesnt work. So a ONE star is even being generous.Poor customer service for a defective piece of equipment. Probably wont order through amazon again for anything important.
2,Good cable and connectors,"The wire quality is good and so are the connectors. I have used it with a webcam, a wacom and for zip drives as well. Never had any problem with connection or speed. Connecting through this is same as connecting to the computer directly."
2,Amazingly portable mouse,"I have enjoyed using this wireless mouse with a portable computer on a portable desk. It features smooth operation, and is a handy alternative to the built-in finger pad on the computer. You must re-insert the USB port stick (into the bottom of the mouse)to fully turn off the mouse and save the battery life. Too bad they did't use a simple switch to do that. Recommended. Great value."
1,this must be a joke,so I am in walmart today and I was going to get this dvd but when I picked it up I thought I was holding a folded piece of cardboard. I worked all night so maybe I am mistaken. Even america online packages their free instal cd better than this and aol gives them away. the final outcome is no sale I will wait for blu ray and if they pull the same silly packaging stunt then I will just pass this movie up
1,Don't Buy This Model,"You may not be aware of this, but this model of Linksys router doesn't work, and when I called Linksys for support they said they couldn't help me unless I sign up for their extended warranty program for $30. When I asked why, they said that the warranty expired for the serial number I provided them. The router would not work, right out of the box!!! I think Linksys changed the firmware, rendering the unit useless, but then they won't offer help. I told their agent that their policy sucks, and that I'd rather spend my money with their competitor...they didn't care, so I went with Netgear....great choice!"
1,Worthless meat thermometer,"I bought this item with high hopes and Amazon delivered it great with a fair price. I've had reasonably good luck with previous digital meat thermometers, but this Taylor model broke the first time I used it. It reads the meat temperature, but it's off by at least 70 degrees and doesn't track evenly, so you can't even use a temperature offset to measure the meat temperature. The timer part works fine, but that's about it. I ended up buying a Rosle digital thermometer and it works great. You can't leave it in the meat while it's in the oven, which was the desired appeal of the Taylor, but it is a well-made digital thermometer and I recommend it highly. Stay away from the Taylor."
2,best of the series,this is awesome i veiwed it along time ago on a rainy saturday night while eating popcorn it scared me suspense is great
1,Not so green,"I picked up a pack of these diapers at my local coop and loved the cloth-like feel and the fact that they were more environmentally friendly. When I saw them on Amazon I stocked up. However my experience with these was totally different. They feel cheaper (more plastic) and the velcro kept falling off the tabs. Out of the 192 diapers I received, at least 25 were useless. I even tried to tape some closed. I still haven't heard from the company about this issue, so I won't ever buy these again."
1,Awful,Music is bad. BAbies with moving mouths are creepy. My 2 year old has no interest. Laurie Berkner makes much better music DVD.
1,One of the worst MP3 players ever made,"I'm a big techno-geek, but this is been one of the most awkward, horrible experiences I've had trying to get this device to do the simplist things. The application to get your MP3s on this is not user friendly, not intuitive. It's like it's strived to be so different from the ipod that it took out all of the good and left the bad. The player doesn't even register half the time with my computer. It takes a good half hour of messing around with the device and the settings to get it to work. I plug in the Ipod and it takes maybe 30 seconds. 1 minute tops.Save your money. Save your aggravation. Get something, anything else."
2,What you should know about Depression,"I don't know why Prozac Nation hasn't been a more notable book. Could be that this is a topic that so many wish not to hear of yet so many have their uneducated opinions on depression, what it is and how to treat and not treat it. This is Wurtzel's story. This is her story of the paralyzing effects of darkness that is inescapable. Depression creates depression and Wurtzel's world becomes more and more hopeless as she sees nothing she can do with what she is afflicted with. ""Sometimes I wish I were an alcoholic so I could go to an AA meeting and I could do something about it."" says Wurtzel. A desperate story but there is hope. Wurtzel finds that hope and here in this book is her journey from darkness."
1,I accually spent money on this?!?,"Yeah...ok, first of, yes, the hard drive looks good. Nice and sleek, plus the silver coloring is pretty cool. HOWEVER...the thing died on me. I don't mean Windows stopped recognizing it, but the lights were still there...I mean it compleatly DIED!!! No power light, no nothing. It worked fine the first couple of times I used it. Heck, I was playing Quake II and Doom off of it. Then, for some odd reason, the drive's power supply up and died. No warning, just kaput. Fortunatly, I was able to get a lot of the stuff I put on it back. Anyway, I've sworn off anything SimpleTech and moved to Western Digital. Yeah, they may be more expensive, but at least they WORK!!! I can't recommend this drive to anyone."
2,Another great book by Augusten!!!,"Everything that Augusten Burroughs has written has been fabulous, and this book is no exception!"
1,Poor Quality,"As described in some previous posts, there is a leak in the seam of the bag making the included patch useless. I bought this for my 4 year old to be from Santa. We blew it up Christmas Eve....and by the way, you might nearly pass out trying to get it blown up enough that he actually stands up and bounces back....but by Christmas morning, it was half deflated and lying on the floor. It is being returned, and Amazon has been very easy to work with on this problem."
2,Better than vol.12,"I own most of the compilations in this series and was always a fan of Cafe del Mar. If you've also found vol.12 very disappointed, like I did, I can recommend buying vol.13. It's very similar to the 25th anniversary addition and one of the better compilations in the series."
2,"""I see dead people's thoughts!""","The premise upon which this book is based is that a blind woman, by touching the hand of a corpse, can somehow connect with that deceased person's last 18 seconds of thought before death. It's a far-out concept, I grant, but if you accept the idea as a reader, you get plunged into a very interesting, creepy and dangerous book. This is a work with a real villain, a sociopath would be a good way to describe him. There are murders both recent and from the past, and two tracks of the plot which eventually come together, and an unlikely hero is found. It's a frightening story, but one that will kep you turning the pages far into the night."
2,Awesome bike rack!,Delivered quickly and packaged well. It was easy to put together and the rack works great! We used it on our recent vacation and had to travel 650+ miles one way. The rack did a great job and the way the bike is secured made me feel even better. This one doesn't allow the bike to move.....no tires turning as you go down the road!
2,Good tray....a little loose,"I bought these trays for use with the Venerati line of chips from Sidepot. They are a little loose, but not too bad."
1,Like all other Chilton manuals. Never covers what you need.,I'm looking for a copy of the original Datsun shop manual. NOW THAT'S A REAL MANUAL.
1,Margarine?,There is one glaring problem in this book. Nearly all margarine contains milk. I did not find a warning about this anywhere in her book. Many of her recipes call for margarine.
1,Reading 400 pages is not necessary.,"This book has good points but is very redundant. Out of all that's being said, the whole idea is to basically run on the balls of your feet and do not over-extend your stride.It doesn't take 400 pages to tell that. However, the book is still enligtening and educational if you choose to read the entire book.For some reason, I believe I could have gotten all of this information for FREE on the Net. But oh well, I won't cry over $24."
2,"I thought it was the bomb, an excellant movie.",The movie mad me laugh and it made me cry. If someone was looking for a great movie featuring great African-American singers who had what it took to get what they wanted this is the movie for them. I can't put all of my feelings for the movie into words; I just know that it was a great movie that stood for something it had a point and it meant something to me.
2,good price and delivery,"as my puppy is small size-- multipoo, so i keep her pee and poo inside house using this pad.amazon saves me not a small amount of money comparing to PETCO or other local pet stores considering my puppy needs 2-3 sheets each day.the delivery is perfect too, i guess this product will be my regular purchase at amazon, for a long time."
2,"Great dvd, slooooowwww shipping","We enjoyed the dvd. We did not put a rush on the shipping, and even despite that the video took much longer to receive than even anticipated. It seems as though it got lost, even with a tracking number. That was a little frustrating, but not sure how much that has to do with the company."
1,incompatible with SimpleTech 256MB,"unfortunately there were no reports on incompatibility when I was buying this piece of equipment (read ""junk""), now they are starting to appear. This cardreader worked only with SanDisk compactflash and did not work properly with my SimpleTech 256MB. I contacted SanDisk tech support via email and it was less than helpful, the only thing they suggested is to return/replace the card. But why would I do this if the card works perfectly with my Canon camera as well as with my new cardreader TravelFlash M280 (http://www.pqi.com.tw). SanDisk made a deffective product and they refuse to even look into the problem.Update: SanDisk recognized the problem: ""There is a known compatibility issue with the SDDR-75 and the newer CF cards. We can provide an exchange for an SDDR-91 (USB 2.0 CompactFlash reader)."""
2,Amusing,"Amusing This is really a funny book to read. Greene makes light of spying during the cold war. Wormold a vacuum cleaner dealer is recruited as a spy for a British secret - organisation in Cuba. He invents all his information to keep the government money coming for his daughter who has expensive wishes. Wormold turns in drawings of vacuum cleaner parts as part of an imaginary secret installation in Cuba and invents agents that all have to be paid. During the whole story nobody remarks, that he is all the time telling lies and still at the end as they know it, they can't do anything because he would show off the secret-agency. Good stuff!"
1,Not as good as stated...,"I bought this DVD a short while back from Amazon with great expectations. This video was made in the early eighties and it shows it's age. This video was marketed as a great aid for expectant parents. On that premise, I decided to purchase it. The video starts off talking about cells and how life got started on earth a million years ago. I was disappointed to see that the first 30-45 minutes didn't really talk about babies at all, but more the fertilization process. There is a short segment at the end that shows a few different stages in the pregnancy, but not nearly enough. I also bought Life's Greatest Miracle by NOVA at the same time. I was a little disappointed in that one too, but it shows more of what I was expecting to see. Whatever you do, don't buy both as I did...A lot of the stuff is redundant. Hope this helps."
1,About what I expected,"The Acting was of porn quality. The film was more like a home movie. I have to hand it to the producers they did tread in taboo waters but chicken out at the last minute.The first story was the best. The story was arousing, actoress were beautiful and some lines were titlateing. Unfornately they skipped from the introduction to the ending. I would of like to seen more of a detailed story.The second story followed thourgh with the concept a little more. If you gothic girls this one is for you. At least this one gave more details.The third story was little more than a snuff. It had several actors some the of female were very attractive. Basically they introduce some and killed them in about 3 seconds..."
2,Tunnel of Love,"The reason I bought this CD was ""Tunnel of Love"". It's a beautiful song. It reminds one of why they are involved with the person in the first place. There are other good songs but ""Tunnel of Love"" takes the cake."
2,a must for travellers,"This books contains informative descriptions, combined with detailed maps, and beautiful pictures, covering all the major wine producing regions of France. In addition, the author includes his favorite vineyards for each region. This book is a must for anyone travelling to France or just interested in learning more about the wine producing regions of France. Included in each section are a few selections on where to eat and where to stay as well. Having personally taken this book on my most recent trip, I can give it my hearty endorsement."
1,insult to the origional,"this takes the origional titles the Fog and spits all over it. Doesen't have anything to do with the cool errie story of the origional, and ends with a totally stupid pointless idea.....crapiest remake ever made...hell this is almost a romantic comedy...yes it's that bad."
2,Great learning dvd,"Great product. Great delivery. My 1 year old daughter enjoys this video. She watches it as she begins her nap and and bedtime. She knows her nose, feet, hands, and mouth. I love they way she enjoys laying and watching the dvd. I thought she had to have the ""Your Baby Can Read"" by Dr. Titzer in order for her to begin early learning. But, she did not. This cd is just as good but less affordable. It is enjoyable for her and impressive to me. It is not boring. It has lots of live babies, they spell out the alphabet, count numbers, show parts of the body and so forth. She has even begun to say words like please and our names. My husband and I love the way she is progressing and plan to buy more."
2,Monster vs Aliens,"I bought this movie because it is my little sister's favorite 3D movie. It has great effects, although I don't honestly care too much for the average plot line. If you're going to buy it, 3D is a must!"
1,BEYOND OFFENSIVE!,"If you love, care, like, or even have the smallest amount of respect for yourself or another person don't expose them to this garbage! I did not expect a movie with taste, and I enjoy B-movies, tacky gross outs, and off color humor. BUT THIS MOVIE GOES WAY OVERBOARD! The filmakers trying so hard to be shocking they forget to give this flick anything that a decent human being could find enjoyable."
2,Jesus' teaching,Its not about understaning the parables as they are as play as day but figuring out what they meant to them and why.I bought this book to go with my inductive bible study and it definitely helped.
2,Definitely worth owning,"There's no question that improvement is possible, but if you listen carefully to this CD you can hear a world of potential. Matt's got a great voice, and the rest of the band has genuine talent. It's the kind of CD you can listen to a lot and not get sick of it. There is a neat level of musical diversity that keeps the tracks each sounding unique - which most popular acts lack. Pick it up, you won't be disappointed."
2,Enjoyed this tape.,Three different levels you can choose. Great if you don't have a lot of time to work-out and is challenging.
1,Chan's Bond spoof should have been funnier and more exciting,"Though watchable and somewhat engaging, the problem with ""The Tuxedo"" is that it comes up short in the two elements one looks forward to in a Jackie Chan film: action and humor. To be sure, there's some action, but it's mostly of the generic action-movie variety than the amazingly-choreographed set pieces we've come to expect in a Chan film. And in place of the usual humor, there's a darkness and mean-spiritness that detracts from the other thing we expect from Mr. Chan: a good time at the movies. Less than a minute or so into the film, for example, we're treated to a [...] joke and a fairly graphic (though admittedly creative) murder by drowning. I guess I don't want to say that all Jackie Chan movies have to adhere to the same light humor/amazing action formula, only that this attempt to be a little different didn't add much to the mix."
2,Fantastic insight on how to relate to a generation,"I read Preaching to a Postmodern World as part of the curriculum for a class I took for my M.Th.It definitely takes more of an ideological approach to ""Postmodern Preaching"" as opposed to systematic... so don't think it's going to give you a step by step explanation on how to ""preach""... But I did find this book to be thought provoking and insightful. As a pastor, I'm always asking myself how I can be an engaging and empowering leader/speaker... And this book offers a lot on insight on how to effectively do just that.If we are ever going to reach the next generation, it's important to understand where they are coming from, how they think, and how we can best relate and engage their culture... And I believe this book offers poignant insights into doing just that."
1,Wastes bird seed,"Does this bird feeder twirl squirrels? Yes it does. However, its design wastes more bird seed than my prior bird feeders because there is no platform for the seed to fall onto. Therefore it all falls on the ground. I have to fill this feeder once a week. That is a LOT of seed. Most of the seed falls on the ground and gets eaten by.....yes, you guessed it, the squirrels.Oh, and by the way, I tried the other Droll Yankees bird feeder that has a seed platform, but the squirrels found a way to hang on to the platform and shovel seed onto the ground.So I am back to seed-on-ground zero.Don't pay the big bucks to buy this bird feeder. It's really a powered, twirling squirrel feeder."
1,Don't Buy,Worked for about 5 weeks. Of course the company I bought it from wouldn't accept a return. Bought from BestEZonlinestore. Would not recommend.
2,Modern approach to important topics of mathematical physics.,"This second volume focuses on several interesting problems arising from mathematical physiscs, making a perfect connection between the purely theoretical digression and the sources from which it originated.The contents are: Pseudodifferential operators; spectral theory; scattering by obstacles; Dirac operators and index theory; Brownian motion and potential theory; the ""D""-bar Neumann problem. Appendix: Connections and curvature.Useful for mathematics and physics advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers. Plenty of excercises and references."
1,HATE IT!,"This is by far the worst product on the market. The entire system seems like a huge waste of bags - which are expensive, time and energy. I find it crazy go out and buy expensive refills when there are other alternatives. It was hard to put together and hard to use. It regardless of how many times you 'twist and seal' it really never stays. The smell was not that bad, however I literally used Lysol on it every time it was emptied. Overall huge waste of money and I eventually threw it away and started saving the bags the paper comes in everyday and threw the dirty ones away in those."
2,"I'll read this one again, soon!","My favorite Beatles related book to date. Geoff Emerick and Howard Massey captured a straight forward account of The Beatles in the studio from beginning to end. Added bonus includes Paul's sojourn in Lagos recording Band on the Run. The interesting happenings their, were not in the studio."
1,Not the Best,"I do not like this meat pounder. While I usually agree with the assessments from America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated, this time I do not. Before writing this, I went to their site to re-read the review and saw that they had declared this Norpro model the victor from among only five models tested. It IS heavy; it IS well-balanced; it IS easy to grip. However, the jarring force exerted on the cook's hand and wrist at the point of impact is pronounced, and I'm no 90-pound weaking. I can feel it in my bones! A pounder with the weight (and impact) positioned away from the wrist by a longer handle to the side is much easier, more efficient, and I'd guess, much safer to use. This one is OK for smaller projects, like one or two chicken breasts. It causes too much discomfort in the hand and wrist to be used for much more at one time."
2,Panamanian artist brings latin reggae/rap to a higher level,"This CD is as innovative as it is addictive to listen to. Roberto Testa a.k.a. Fito Blanko is all of 21 years old. Born in Panama City, Panama, moved to Canada at 5 years of age, the kid's got it all. He rhymes, he flows, he throws it down, with style and maturity. When Higher Level hits the States at month's end, this fresh boyee's gonna blow up!"
2,Life Savers,These crocs are incredibly comfortable. I got them for my husband who steps heavily around the house and they have helped loads. The color is very versatile also. He loves them!
2,Wish I'd found these years ago!,"A friend recommended these to me and so I ordered two to try them out. I absolutely love them! They combine the best parts of a loofa and a large washcloth into one product. The size is perfect and it generates a ton of lather. I read a few reviews of people receiving knock-offs, but the ones from my seller were definitely genuine."
2,An excellent buy at a very good price,"Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue in D minor"" sounded glorious on these speakers. The woofer has a rich quality and doesn't buzz out at higher decibels, keeping a clean sounding Fugue. The mid-range and high still keep a clear sound during the Toccata and didn't miss a note, but still abstained from getting tinny.Kodo Drummer's ""Monochrome"" managed to get through the quiet parts without any hiss and, again, deep bass notes really resonate here without the irritating buzz found in cheaper speakers.The impression of movement allowed by a 2.1 system was consistent and for basic PC use, there's enough immersion for the single user. First-person shooters come alive with proper speaker placement.The only word of warning I can think of is to not push these speakers past 3/4 full volume. If it makes the windows rattle, that's loud enough and anything over that is simply ridiculous. These speakers can push enough air at less than 50%."
1,I couldn't stand this book,"I don't think I had ever not finished a book before I read this. Seriously. I skipped almost half the book becasue of the boring story some old guy was telling. It bored me to tears, and it barely even talked about the whole Sleeping Beauty connection, just about being persecuted because the guy was gay. I dodn't want to know about how his lover killed himself or ANYTHING. And that is why I skipped most of it, and just read the last page."
2,A difficult path,"The modern physicist learns about electromagnetism as a done deal; a very polished product centred about Maxwell's equations. But this book shows the long forgotten tribulations and controversies that got us to today's known state.This text is rather specialised. You need to be thoroughly conversant with electromagnetism. On a par with Jackson's text, ""Classical Electrodynamics"". But presumably you also have an interest in the history of your field. Darrigol shows that the path was often obscure. Only in full hindsight, after Maxwell and also Einstein made their contributions, did it all come clear.The scarcity of vector notation in the 19th century accounts can make reading some of the equations a little awkward. You have to perform some slight mental contortions to reinterpret what they're saying, in modern notation."
1,Don't buy this CD-ROM version.,"I bought this CD-ROD version. When I execute program, it always require CD-ROM insertion. I cannot use ths program without CD-ROM. And the design of the program is out of date. This CD-ROM was made in 1999. And even worse, the developer of the CD version program( VERSAWARE) was out of business. So I cannot update the program. I regret buying this CD version dictionary."
2,good deal on a good product,"Matches the combi dx car seat perfectly so they work great together as a travel system. Folds up, has the cool carrying strap. Lays back or sits up, easy to adjust. Easy to put together. Easy to clean. Easy to maneuver, unlike some bulkier strollers I've seen. I can steer it one-handed. The cup holder is easy to put on and take off, but the baby can't take it off, so the baby bottle or sippy cup can go there, maybe clip a bottle leash to it, and you're all set. Looks stylish with the pretty, bright blue color. The wheels are like a hard plastic so they won't pop or lose air. All 4 wheels have brakes. Looks stylish, feels comfy, easy to clean, easy to use. The bar across the lap is easy to take off or put on and it's a little bit squishy/bendy in the middle for comfort, unlike regular hard plastic, which I think is really cool. I was pleasantly surprised. I feel like I got a good deal on a good product."
2,"As good at gaming as a $3,000 gaming PC","With the cell processor, backward compatibility, blu-ray player, HD gaming, wi-fi, memory card readers, HDMI input, this system beats the pants off any other gaming machine (including Bills!) A bunch of people already reviewed this product in detail. I just want to say that it really is as good as the hype. If anyone puts ""not helpful"" on this, they must own 360s!"
1,The artwork is lovely but.......,"I am just sorry. This SEEMS like the kind of book I would really like. I bought it for my granddaughter when she was tiny. Now she is five and we picked it for a bed time story a couple of weeks ago. I just felt embarrassed reading it to her; it seemed to make no sense. We agreed that it was rather goofy. While trying to be serious! I guess maybe that's why we abandoned it before the middle for one of our old favorites, Mariana and the Merchild. Glad so many of you enjoyed it though."
1,Not Too Good,"My daughter in school likes to order these things. They ship them to the dorm or least that is what she says. I tried them. I did not like the taste. If fact, I could not eat them because of the taste. I thought these Pringles Potato Crisps, White Cheddar would surprise me. You know, I really was disapointed."
2,I'm very pleased!,"I've eaten stuffed grape leaves from a variety of sources and recently, I decided I'd like to add more interesting and varied on hand foods.I received my order today. I opened a can and it's funny to write this, but when I emptied them out onto a plate I realized what a good job they did packing them! They came out nice, and I'm amazed at how well and how many. I was going to heat them, and I figured I'd eat one cold...well, I just ate all of them without heating them, they're that good!I'll definitely keep this on my list."
1,lento y no duradero,"Se lo regale a mis padres, estubieron fascinado con el resultado del café, pero se demoraba 1 hora en hacerse el cafe hasta que dejo de funcionar. La dejaron prendida y se quemó, les duro 3 meses."
2,Another excellent Tori album,"Tori Amos is sure one talented woman! She's been releasing great albums all along her career combining her amazing voice with piano and subtle yet very emotional songwriting. This album is no exception! This time she adds some more interesting elements such as electronic sounds to enrich some of her songs. No matter what she does though the effect is simply amazing. While not as good as her earlier albums ""From the Choirgirl Hotel"" is a very nice addition to your Tori Amos catalogue and a very good album to own."
1,Could have been better,"This is a great item to have if you're a boxing fan. Unfortunately, it really falls short on the biographies, and also...and very important it's missing some of the greatest latin boxing legends. Figures like Wilfredo Benitez, Wilfredo Gomez,Esteban De Jesus. I guess because this dvd was aimed to Mexicans or somebody else but there were a few Puertorican boxers worth mentioning. All in all, not worth having if you are not Mexican."
1,Gel? Doesn't feel like it.,"Compared to my last gel mouse pad, this feels like a rock. My wrist has been hurting after a week of use. Then entire mouse surface is cloth (lycra?) as well, which isn't necessary with most laser/led mice being produced these days. It's just going to trap dirt like crazy."
2,Organized,This is great. Before this all the pieces would be all over the house. I was using a basket but this is more organzied and my son can see all his puzzles easily.
2,The evolution of a classic on quality,"Each edition of this book reflects the state of the art on Quality at the time it was published, so the text included on each edition tends to change in order to keep updated. This fifth edition accomplish the objective of bringing us the best on Quality systems with concepts that go from classical to innovatives.""The Handbook"" is a book that must be on any quality specialist's shelf. It doesn't have the absolute truth about quality but it can give you many hints...Why the fifth star is missing?, because this edition is a little dated (ISO-9000/1994). But if you want to ""embrace the quality"" you should be looking for this edition, the next and the previous editions in order to get the whole picture about the evolution of quality. You'll never regret about this investment."
2,This is by far my favorite book!,"I read many books by this author and others like him. This is by far the best book I have ever read! I reccomend this book to everybody who likes books that lead you to different conclusions about the virus every chapter. I feel this book is for mostly adults, however I am 13 and I loved this book. The reason I think mostly adults will like this book is because you need to have a backround on biology. You don't need to know much, just a little bit. I know most of my friends like and understand it, but some people don't. I LOVE THIS BOOK!"
2,Back To His Roots,Stephen King has been a favorite of mine since I was an adolescent and he continues to deliver his novels in the same voice as always. Reading King is like visiting an old friend...you always know it's going to be what you expect. Rarely are you disappointed...it's always just what you thought it would be. You like King's characters. You like the places he takes you. You like what he has to say. You don't always like where he leaves you in the end...but it's his world.I'm glad King still has books in him. I can't wait to see this one taken to the silver screen
1,Where's The Meat?,"This is probably the all-time worst self-help series I have ever heard. Lucinda Bassett is a shallow motor-mouth who can talk endlessly on any subject & never actually say anything. I would say her genius lies in creating all these self-help products out of nothing at all, & then making them appear to be something. There is no meat here at all, it's empty, sophomoric marketing nonsense. Serious waste of money."
2,Convenient and works great for me,This works for me. I have a 4 cup mr coffee that fits perfectly on this unit. I can reheat the coffee when I am ready for the second cup. I did notice that I needed to use a cup that made good contact with the heating part. I use a small heavy duty china cup rather than a ceramic mug and it heats up nicely. I feel spoiled and will likely be buying another one.
2,Loved this book!!,"John Murphy is a creative genius. This book is fantastic. I do many crafts but am not that great at hand-sewing. Luckily, it doesn't matter when making a stupid creature, because even if yours is sloppily-done, it just adds to the charm. Adults and kids have LOVED the many creatures I've made, and it's been fun keeping a lookout for socks to use.You don't need to follow his patterns; his general instructions are all I needed to go to town on these."
1,Extra Lame,What a bad movie a waste of time. No ending. It has a really bad semi sci-fi story if you can call it a story.
1,Returning this one,"First off, the lights aren't bright enough. Second, the fan is too loud. Third, and the reason why I'm returning it, the magnetron blew out after 2 months of lite use. Luckily, Home Depot will still let me return it, because Maytag will repair it but they won't replace it."
2,Technics RP-DH1200 DJ,"Hi,if you are a dj this the best headphone you can buy everything about it is good,the Technics RP-DH1200 DJ is the best of the best so party on people get it."
1,Worthless,I really liked the idea of a large clock in my backyard when I am swimming. And this would've been great except that the hands did not move. Not at all - yes I put fresh batteries in it.What a disappointment. Thank goodness for Amazon and their outstanding return policy.Stay away from this item.
2,"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe:The Chronicles of Narnia---Kudos to CS Lewis","This was a pleasant read---interesting plot, good vs evil! Was wondering if they would every get back tothe wardrobe closet---read it, you'll enjoy it!---JCA (not JVA)"
1,Magical or Tragical,"Well as far as a film goes this is pretty stupid. However, I own a copy & would never trade it in.I'm a Beatles fan - & if I look at this not as a film but as a collection of music videos then it's well worth it - especially for ""I am the Walrus"".There's no screenwritting credits for this because there was no real script. Paul McCartney & Ringo Starr decided to fill a bus with interesting people - & film it - & wait for the magic to happen.The magic never happened in so far that a 'movie' didn't emerge - just a lot of disjointed imagery.But this is a must for a Beatles nut like myself."
1,dog vitamins,I have 2 pugs that have NEVER refused anything to eat. Neither pug will touch these vitamins. I've since bought other brands and have no problem. They smell terrible to me too.
1,very poorly made junk,"I orderd this watch box hoping that it was as nice as it was stated on your website but when I received it I was very dissapointed. I needed to give it as a gift and was extremely embaresed and dissapointed. I question if I will ever trust this company again, amazon needs to make sure the quality of there products are as stated."
2,Only some of the cover text is Japanese,"This is indeed the same as the albumn c. 1973 with Ben Vereen as Judas, Yvonne Elliman as Mary Magdalene, etc. Sounds the same as I remember only cleaner."
2,A great book on Bible prophecy,"Apocalypse Code is probably the book you want to buy if your interested in the Book of Revelation and end-time prophecy. Lindsey describes the various aspects of the Book of Revelation in great detail and he writes in a way that is pretty easy to understand. He also relates many aspects to the world we live in today. By doing this he shows the reader that he has extensive knowledge of international affairs. This, in my opinion, gives the book more credibility. The book should appeal to any Christian who is interested in spreading the gospel to those that are lost. Highly recommended!"
2,I'm Batman!!!,"Probably one of my favorite movies of all time, Tim Burton's Batman is a fantastic rendition of our favorite caped crusader. This was the first movie I remember seeing as a child and Ive been a Batman fanatic ever since. If you haven't seen it WTF is wrong with you?!?! It has some flaws when compared to the Comic but still a great movie."
2,Not your father's Dostoevsky.,"A stylish, sexy ode to LA. The script takes the original's 19th century themes of love, longing and loneliness and updates them for our modern, often strange, urban world. With polished cinematography that transcends the usual indie moviemaking, nice performances all around, and--surprise, Dostoevsky fans--even moments of humor, this L.A. story brings Dostoevsky into the 21st century."
1,Absolute crap - poor quality control,I love the Gerber 400 series multi-tool and decided to try this Diesel set. I bought 4 of these units and two have broken within 2 weeks of using them. The first unit the hinge button popped off and the second the safety lock fell off the knife side. The rivets came lose and bits fell off.Don't let this review discourage you from the other Gerber 400 series. The 400 series is fantastic... this Diesel series sucks.
2,Good film though it gets a bad rap,"The Exorcist II The Heretic while not as successful as the original(seeing it was competing with Star Wars which slaughtered any film competition) isn't as bad as the first film pallies. Linda Blair had blossomed from a little girl into a drop dead gorgeous woman(would get more attractive in later years) and she returns as Regan and this time is trying to stop Pazuzu(the demon that was un ID'd in the first film). I always liked the film and whilst most people say this film is crap, blame Warner Bros, don't blame the actors involved. Please watch or I'll yell HEEGOTCHA!"
1,The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,"Not sure who's fault this album is. Clive or Bo Bice's. At any rate, Bo is a great singer and was great on AI. Here he is not worth 2 cents. There is not one good song on this album. It's terrible and if you don't believe me, buy it and hate yourself for being so dumb and gullible that this is any good."
1,Dirty Little Novel,"Charles Blackey is down on his luck and needs money. So he accidently finds a white man who wants to live in his apartment. Fine, but where's the good parts in his book? And besides, the book is really dirty. I don't recommand it to anyone under 16. The book is nothing but a poor depiction of some of the nation's pariahs live their lives. The writing style is terrible. Dry and simple, looks like a high school kid wrote it. Don't waste your time reading this book. There are a lot of better ones out there."
1,"Poor Quality, No Service",Mat developed a break in the seam during it's second season of use.Wenger does not answer their phones and they leave you hanging. They do not honor their warranty claims as described by Amazon.
1,A bit depressing,"I got this dvd with the hopes of seeing more of the amazing Eddie Izzard standup, however, he appears in very little of the actual dvd. Some of the comedians/sketches are funny (the one compairing Eddie Izzard to Obi-Wan Kenobi is freakishly hilarious), but overall, I was very disapointed. However, there are a few funny moments, that almost make it worth it (the Yorkshire men skit for example). Oh, and watch the outtakes. They're almost funnier than the actual dvd.Note to American Audiences: Much of this humor is very British, and you will not understand it all. Likewise, some of these comedians have VERY thick accents that make it difficult for non-UKers to understand what they're saying. (Much like Brad Pitt's character in the movie ""Snatch"") You can tell that they speak English, but individual words are EXTREAMLY hard to make out for some of the comedians."
2,Very informative!!!,"I found this book to be very informative. I grew up around horses and have recently thought about purchasing a miniature horse. I am not an active member of the horse comunity anymore but still love the animals. This book offered some very helpful tips on caring for a mini with the limited space I now have.I found the book to be a great introduction to owning a miniature horse. In addition to the great tips on caring for a mini, the book also shows the diversity of the horses. I can't wait to attend a miniature horse show! I also enjoyed the photography in this book. It really captures the personalities of these little horses.Over all, very good."
2,"Good performance, but","This is the 3rd Royal Albert titles concert I have watched, the video on all 3 is unimaginative, but not terrible.Adele is a powerful singer in every respect and it comes across on the video.Adele knows how to play her audience, this is evident.Like the Sting concert, I guess the most common pronoun and adverb in the English Language is now the F bomb, at least for these two performers. I didn't get it at the Sting concert and I don't get it with Adele. Perhaps British for ""I'm not a silver spoon?""Anyway great display of her talents, but her mouth takes away from her brilliant performance."
2,I am in awe,"I picked this album up due to countless reccomendations from just about everybody, I was a little skeptical at first considering I heard some of their ffirst album and it wasn't exactly my cup of tea, but with this album they got rid of all ""nu"" elements andd just released an in your face, ass kicking REAL metal album, CHIMAIRA I APPLAUD YOU!"
2,Wonderful book,"This is an absolutely fantastic mystery/romance. I own it and have read it multiple times, along with most of the rest of Mary Stewarts books. It's one of the books I never get tired of. No matter how many times I read it, I still can't put it down when I'm in the middle of it. I highly, highly recommend it."
1,don't buy paperback,"I bought a new paperback version. Two days later, chapter 1 is falling out of the book. As for the content, it is really dry. Some solutions are in the back but no explainations. If you have to get this book, go hardback."
2,Absolutely charming,"Taleb's first book, _Dynamic Hedging_, is the options trader's trading book. Easily the finest book on the subject, it has just enough math for rigor, and plenty of intuition and application. So I picked up _Fooled By Randomness_ to see what the man would have to say with many more words and many fewer equations. This is a wonderful book, full of humor and subtlety. Don't expect it to impart the secrets of success in the financial markets -- it's more a collection of anecdotes and thoughts from a successful career. But it sheds light on the kind of thinking necessary to ensure longevity in trading."
1,"This router is terrible, try D-Link instead","I got this up and working in no time, however it is unreliable. After about 3 days the router was locked up, I thought no big deal. A week later the red diagnostic indicator stays on all the time and it is completely useless when this happens. Also the reset button is useless no matter how long you hold it down it does nothing..."
1,useless - too thin,These burp cloths are useless! They are super-thin terry cloth and a bit smaller than the average burp cloth. I now use them when giving my baby a bath.
2,SKA AT IT'S WACKIEST,"The Aquabats: A Ska rollercoater collision of The B-52's, Devo and DC Comics all rolled into one. Addictively fun! A party-band supreme, you must see them live. ""CD-Repo Man"" is the answer to everyone who ever took my CD's and never gave them back."
2,I like this one,"this album is definatly not what we expected from blink, given their last albums, enema of the state and take off your pants and jacket, to name a few. But I think that Blink matured a little in making this album. Some fans dont like it because its not what they expect of blink. But for teens with rigid parents who had to buy this cd secretly(like me) it doesnt have that many cuss words, so feel free to play as lound as you want."
1,It makes me so angry,Just like most people while it worked it worked great BUT then the screen stopped working 3 months after I started using it. Will never buy Polaroid again. ARG! Oh I'm over my 90 days so yes they will replace with out of warranty payment of $120.00 plus shipping and tax. ARG ARG!
2,solid,"does exactly what I want it to do, just hang there. Looks great and it is very noticeable from far away"
2,oh my gawd....,"This is the coolest CD I've ever stuck in my machine (sorry Joni). Her voice,the lyrics, her husband, it's great from beginning to end. I feel like I'm sitting on a porch somewhere in the Blue Ridge Mountains with a cold beer, a guitar and a bunch of my friends. I love alt/country and have some great music, but this thing is perfect. Buy it. Now. Do they come to Minnesota and do you think they'd want to be my friends? Oh well..."
1,HORRIBLE,"This cd was a MAJOR dissapointment to me. I used to expect more out of Warren Griffin but now i have realized that all i can ever expect from Warren G anymore is below average useless Crap. This CD has no message, its lyrics suck, and so do the beats. If anyone wants to check out some good rap look no farther then the bay area. Warren G and Co. Fell off quite some time ago. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DONT BUY THIS CD!"
2,Best in the series!,"In book 3 of The Edge Chronicles, we again travel with Twig, the Sky Pirate Captain, and his crew through another fun filled adventure. In this book, Twig receives information that will affect the future of Sanctaphrax, and possibly all life on The Edge. He must act quickly, or life as they know it will come to an abrupt halt. This page turner follows Twig in his efforts to save himself, but more importantly, his fine and loyal friends.This novel is far and away the best of the series thus far. In addition to the well told story, we get a closer glimpse into the personalities of the individual characters that we are learning to enjoy. Here's hoping that the rest of the series continues to build with the success we have seen this far!"
2,Zoinks: The band for guys who secretly love their cousin.,"This cd rocks, just not as much as the previous two. In my opinion, the last two songs could have been omitted, but Zoinks always choose quantity over quality."
2,Black & Decker FSMVC BDTM250 9.6V-18V Fast Charger,"After I received the replacement for the one that arrived broken, the Black & Decker FSMVC BDTM250 9.6-18V Fast Charger worked beautifully and as promised."
2,Revoking the Implied Consent,Jeane Manning does an excellent job of bringing technically esoteric material to within reach of the average person. That has always been Jeane&#65533;s genius. ... There are serious problems in our energy sector but none of those lie with the inventors.Since the formation of the monopolies the energy innovation socket interface capabilities have atrophied so as to be non-existent. The energy innovation pipeline has been plugged for some 80 years and courageous journalists like Jeane Manning are doing the dirty job of unplugging it. The public has been duped and consequently affords these special interests an implied consent. Its time to revoke that implied consent and move on to our clean and cheap energy birthright.The Hilary Burtons would have us believe that the Enron&#65533;s of the world are doing what&#65533;s best for us all and the environment.Martin J. Burger...
2,This is the one that we have all been waiting for!,The production is first class. We have waited a long time for this DVD and it is well worth it.
2,Brand New Puts Out Another Stellar Album,"I love Brand New. I have every one of their CDs and their sound changes on each album. This album is very chill and energetic. It's a weird mix, but they make it fit. Seriously, I believe Brand New keeps rock music alive. If it wasn't for them, I'd probably give up on rock. I love them. All 3 of their CDs have been masterpieces. Check every CD out and check brand new out live, they're amazing. I've seen them numerous amounts of times and don't intend to stop. I hope I get another 20 years out of them. ANOTHER ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF 2006, in my opinion, not the best, but definitely on the list!STANDOUT TRACKS: Jesus Christ, Not the Sun, You Won't Know, Handcuffs, MillstoneAWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME CD!! GO OUT AND GET IT!"
1,carrie underwood ruined my outlook on life!,"Her Cd ruined my entire week. Every song is filled with such hate and disgusting vocals. Some Hearts is an awful song about her hating other people. I hope that she stops singing and gets a hold of herself before she gets slammed. She used to be a sweet girl, what happened."
2,A 10 year old's review,i lov this book!!! It is my favorite thing ever!!! If you want to get a good thing for someone else or yourself you should buy this!!!
2,"Excellent book, manages to be entertaining AND exposing","Definitely worth the price in entertainment value alone. It's value in revealing the truth is priceless.If you enjoy a fact based secret operations related expose, buy this book.If you are interested in learning about the kind of betrayal being perpetrated in the name of America, buy this book.99.9% of Americans would strongly disapprove of the policy of eliminating citizens for knowing too much, yet, under the guise of government support, this is what is happening.Mr. King's book will hopefully result in investigations that bring all those responsible to account for their betrayal of American values and ideals."
2,"Great, But a Little Dated","This was great Palm when it was new. It's clear, complete the author knows the Palm and it's and not oversimplified. Even now I would recommend this as the place to start for those who are not technophobes. But the book is over two years old. There's lots of new software out like Wordsmith which gives you real fonts and the ability to save in .rtf, and peripherals like those folding keyboards."
1,The do not work in the paslode Li Ion trim nailer,Even though this item comes up as frquently purchased togeather when buying a new Paslode Li Ion trim nailer they do not work in this nailer. Also not a returnable item. Can then be used as paper weight to remind you not to follow purchased togeather suggestions.
1,Not too impressed,"All of the reviews on this product that I read were good but I got it home I was not very impressed. I found it hard to operate and it hurt my nipples. I know pumping does not feel wonderful, but I was in pain. It has a bunch of little parts and if you don't put it together just right it won't work. I recommend saving your money and just buying a medela."
2,Unlike any other series on TV,"I can't really add anything that hasn't already been mentioned by other reviewers, except I thought I had seen all of the episodes when they originally aired. The last two shows were ""new"" to me, and the last episode was IMHO the best of the season."
1,Alt-country emo??,"No, really--I love Lucinda Williams. I've liked her earlier albums and I like her voice; it's a nice change in a music genre that often seems to idealize baby-voiced vocalists like Emmylou Harris, Nanci Griffith, and Iris DeMent (all of whom are fine singers, of course, but it's unusual to hear a female singer with Williams' deep, husky, voice).I found this album musically monotonous. Really monotonous. Like, sleep-inducing. I could chalk that up to personal taste and forgive it if more of the songs had lyrics that were interesting or meaningful beyond fairly standard pop fare. Too many of these, as much as I hate to think it, were warmed-over rhymes and old themes with no new insight.Get Car Wheels instead."
2,Sounds like my family,"The latest installment in the Molly Masters series is charming and full of family moments that ring true to life. The mystery itself, which centers around the death of the seemingly perfect PTA president, is typical of the genre. Although entertaining enough, it certainly didn't overwhelm my imagination. Molly's encounters with her family, however, were brilliant. Her exchanges with her 16-year old daughter Karen, who is learning to drive and beginning to date, were a wonderful mixture of humor and angst. Even more touching was her discussion with her son, Nathan, who is being harassed by bullies at school. Overall, I definitely recommend this book to readers of the series!"
2,A time travel story for the mature crowd...,"I looked at some of the other reviews here and saw that the main objection to Niffenegger's novel seems to be its language and very adult situations. Well, believe it or not, adult situations are often what adults find themselves in, and the words the characters spoke are ones adults speak. Instead of offensive, I found the characters to be believable as a result, which helped to make the unusual premise believable too. In other words, since the characters are so well grounded in reality, the peculiar time-travel elements are accepted with little or no hesitation. This is a clever book that adults will enjoy, although I will agree with the reviewers who say it shouldn't be shared with anyone underage, since Niffenegger's intended audience is clearly mature adults who can appeciate the realism she creates."
1,Didn't answer my question,I had only one question I wanted answered by this book -- why do mosquitos bite some people (such as me!) and not others. It was never addressed.
1,Not a good way to prepare for the SAT!,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I have been getting ready for the SAT and I was hoping to find some good tips--without having to take a course. Well, I went to the wrong place. I bought two books, the Princeton Review 'cracking the SAT' book and the Kaplan book, thinking they were the best in the business, and I was only right about one of them. The Kaplan book was filled with silly ideas that just didn't work.. . and it wasn't for a lack of trying. I worked with the book almost religiously for about a month, and my scores went DOWN! The techniques were silly and confusing. In fact, their ideas about how to do the math section were totally messed up. As far as the verbal section went, the only section I managed to not go down on was the critical reading section, and that's because I pretty much ignored it and did it my own way. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!"
2,Highly Recommended Read,This book was an eye opener for me and I highly recommend it to anyone that is concerned or confused by the not so hidden agenda and inaccurate history contained in the Da Vinci Code. I found the book very informative and have shared it with my friends. Whether you are a christian or non-christian this book ought to be on your short list of books to read this summer.
2,"Mystery, Suspense, & Romance",I loved this book! If you can get past the boring beginning it is GREAT!
2,Serial Joe at Their Most Raw,"I first heard this band while on vacation in New Brunswick maybe 9 or 10 years ago. Even though I only heard one song (Mistake), I was hooked. I finally got around to picking up their entire catalog, including ""Face Down""- this is the band at their most raw. There's some amazing music on this album, made even more remarkable by the fact that the band playing it were barely freshmen in high school. There's a three song stretch on this CD of truly jaw-dropping, heavy music- starting with the quick-fire riffing on ""Centipede"", the tight guitar/bass/drum interplay of ""Confused"", and the funky ""Outrage"", which sounds really close to ""Mothers' Milk""-era Chili Peppers. Other standouts include the angry ""Should Have Been Mine"" and the RATM-alike ""Deep"". It's a shame this band broke up before reaching their full potential, because had they stuck it out I believe they'd be putting out some amazing music nowadays."
2,Thank You So Much,"Had this book on my shelf for 6 years before reading and it is all that. So nice to read something from another black woman's perspective. It changed my life. Forget the haters. When 2012 or thereabouts comes around every head will bow, every knee will bend and every tongue will confess. Thank you, thank you. It fits in with the research I've done and what I've been hearing lecturer Bobby Hemmitt say for years."
1,light weight,"Firstly, the sound quality is of demonstration quality. On a revealing system this disc sounds terrific. As to the musical performance, totally pro. As to musical content, superficial pop-oriented tunes pretending to be New Age.For fans of Kenny G only, or perhaps people who take exceedingly long rides in elevators."
2,"Calphalon is good, but could be better","The pros: Calphalon is a great material for cooking, it has a very uniform heat distribution and is very solid. On this piece, the shallow design is perfect for simmering up your favorite sauce. The curved lip makes spills a thing of the past.The cons: Calphalon is not dishwasher safe, so make sure you are ready to hand-wash your new pan. Also, avoid drips down the outside of your cookware at all costs - Calphalon stains like crazy! They DO sell a cleanser, haven't had a chance to clean mine yet - so I hope it works. Finally, this is NOT the standard depth pan, it is SHALLOW, so make sure you know what you are buying.Final word: This is a fantastic price for this piece of cookware - can you believe this is going for 60% off? Problem is, if you want to complete the set, you had better be willing to shell out some serious dough. If you love to cook, can afford Calphalon, and don't mind the clean-up, this is the pan for you."
1,GEORGIA RULE,"Good day,Today is 19 November 2010. I ordered and paid for the DVD ""Georgia Rule"" on 4 October 2010. I did not get this DVD. Kindly please confirm if you did sent this item."
1,FOUR points made me Dissatisfied,I'm not satisfied .1) It doesn't have enough description.2) No clear and actual photo.They should write a very specific details and more actual photo for the item.3) The delivery date is very far from the day I bought the item.4) I received my item in the last day of estimated arrival days (too late).Thank you.
1,DEFINITELY NOT THE BEST BOND FLICK,"i had the feeling i was seeing a made for USA cable flick instead of a real 007 adventure. the dialogue seems straight out of a tv movie. timothy dalton was way too damn serious as 007. the stunts and special fx are fine especially the opening sequence w/ Bond ""fishing"" for the villain's jet in mid-air. but those blue wedding suits! ugh! talisa soto=worst bond babe ever! carey lowell an ok bond babe. worst theme song by gladys knight. i'll stick with THUNDERBALL, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, OCTOPUSSY & THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH."
1,Believe the bad reviews,"I've never taken the time to write a review, but I couldn't resist sharing my frustration about this product. Pinnacle Studio 8 is by far the worst piece of software I have ever seen or tried (in vain) to use. My new and powerful computer crashed almost every time I even tried to open the program. Capturing video was nearly impossible. I'm embarrassed to have wasted even three days of my life with it. Please be forewarned and don't waste YOUR time or money."
2,Magnificient,"I don't know if this is the ""greatest"" novel I've ever read, but it is certainly my favorite. Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae stand as two of the greatest characters in American literature. People who dismiss 'Lonesome Dove' as simply a ""popular"" novel are complete knuckleheads. If there was ever a story or characters who better embody the West and the elegiac quality of that time and place, I can't image them."
2,Back in print at last!!!,"It's incredibly good news for the legions of Avram Davidson fans that this book is finally appearing in an easily accessible and, more importantly, *inexpensive* edition. Originally published in 1993 in fewer than 1,000 copies (of which I've been lucky to own one), it has been out of print for years. When used copies turn up they go for hundreds of dollars. And they seldom come up.As the seller of one of two copies of the 1993 edition available at this writing says in his description of the book: ""The last book by Avram Davidson published during his lifetime,a collection of erudite and digressive essays on mermaids, phoenixes, silk, dragons, and similar topics."" That pretty much sums it up, except to add that it's a great read. George Barr's accompanying illustrations sprinkled throughout the text are a delight, too."
2,This is a MUST HAVE!,"I have never done a music review before, but this one is a MUST. ""Eternal"" has that classic Isley Brothers sound, with a few songs making references to some of their older hits. Jill Scott, R. Kelly and Avant are featured artists, giving the classic sounds a contemporary lift. ""Ernie's Jam"" is a jab that is meant to remind you of who the Isleys were, and still are. While all of the songs are great, two deserve special attention.Do you remember their old classic ""All I Need/Make Me Say It Again Girl?"" They remade it! It sounds BEAUTIFUL! It's just as passionate as the original, even though the words are different. Like the original, this one makes you melt.The title cut ""Eternal"" is...damn. That's all I can say!If, no WHEN, you buy this CD, make sure you have the bubble bath, the bottle of wine and the candles to go along with it."
1,Replacing belts a nightmare,"After cleaning 3 rooms with the machine, one of the belts came off. After an hour of following instructions and trying to get the belt back on, I gave up. Two hands just aren't enough to hold both rollers in place and stretch the belt onto the sprockets on the bottom of the rollers. I had gotten the machine for free from a relative who had recently passed away who had never even taken it out of the box so I just threw it away. If I had paid money for it, I would probably still be trying to get the belt back on but life is just too short to spend that kind of time on such a frustrating task. I hope this review saves you from buying one and experiencing this problem."
2,found it...I think!,"I was so sad to see that this book was out of print. I really wanted to read it! But, I think I've found it! It's in a book called ""The Tolkien Reader"". (here on Amazon they also call it ""A Tolkien Reader"") The book includes ""The Adventures of Tom Bombadil"", ""Farmer Giles of Ham"" and ""On Fairy Stories"". Enjoy! : )"
2,Quickbooks 2007,A nice layout without a need to drastically learn new processes for the the functions. Conversion of old files to the new version was good. I wish they offered an upgrade. I was happy with the 2004 version but to prevent problems because of Microsofts enhancement I had to buy the 2007 version.
2,Soft and comfy PJ's,"I love these PJ's for home wear for my daughter. The elastic is not too tight and does not leave marks on baby's body. Washes and wears well. Colors are aesthetically pleasing. The only small issue (not really an issue for me though) was that instead of the gray PJ I got a sky blue PJ in the pack. The other 2 colors are as indicated. The 'Large' size fits my 30"" tall and 21 lbs heavy baby perfectly right now."
2,... and hilarity ensued,"I stumbled across Tom Lehrer while listening to Pandora one day. After looking him up on youtube, I promptly created a station based on him and haven't ""looked back"" since. I absolutely LOVE his music. I realized that when I was in Chemistry in High School, the teacher had us watch a video with his elements song in the background. I had no idea at the time who had done it, I just knew I loved the song (I guess that makes me a bit of a nerd). It might be a bit ""boring"" for younger generations because of some of the humor, but even so there is a lot there to laugh about anyway."
2,Works!,Works as advertised. Arctic Silver 5 is the best thermal paste on the market and it was the cheapest here. My unlocked AMD X4 B50 idles at 31-32C on AMD's Cool 'N Quiet with a Cooler Master Hyper 212 plus CPU fan and Antec 300 case with 3 case fans. Under normal load like extended gaming the CPU peaks around 42 degrees C.Good stuff.
2,Cat's Tongue,"When the album was produced Cat was bantering with Hal Ashby about which numbers could be included in the movie ""Harold and Maude"" (Bud Cort & Ruth Gordan)...He eventually recorded the most memorable rendition of poetic lyrics to be backdropped into an obvious antisocial medium. The movie and album became an anthem for many of us. There was never a soundtrack for the film so those of us who enjoyed the visual rely upon this inspiring collection."
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING!!!,"This is an excellent album, but this version of ""Megadeth-Criptic Writings"" has very poor audio quality. The ""original"" version is MUCH better. I used to have the ""original"" vesion, I bought when the album first came out in a record store. I lost it so I decided to buy another, but I chose this ""remastered"" version and was terribly disappointed. The sound quality is so poor you can barely make out the high notes. It sounds like you turned the high settings on your stereo all the way down, and turned the midrange all the way up, while leaving the lows in the middle. It sounds terrible. BE WARNED!!!"

2,Awesome Battery Tender,I bought this for my 1996 Harley and found this to be the best battery tender. It works great and keeps my battery conditioned over a long Pennsylvania winter! When spring comes my bike's battery is ready to go. I have owned this product for about 2 years and it is great. It is so simple to use and has the connections necessary to use on different batteries. My uncle ended up buying this exact one for his tractor and trolling motor on his boat. He is also impressed by the quality!
2,very thourough and detailed,I had previously purchased this same book a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it. I lost it and so I wanted to get another one now that I am interested in breeding bettas again.
2,just fine,"Works fine. Operates as expected based on Amazon reviews I read prior to purchase (thanks). Clean-up is easier than anticipated. Hooked up to a large propane tank, a change that is worth the effort."
1,Kept waiting for it to get intriguing or at least exciting.,Where was the punch to the book? Very mundane. No suspense. More like a documentary on death row inmates.
2,awesome work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When I first was told about this band I was a little skeptical. I consider myself a rock kind of person. When I heard the first song (68) I was blown away. These guys are awesome every song is spectacular. They are just like everclear. I would reccomend this cd to just about anyone. actually everyone should own this cd period.
1,A tough read and Asimov wouldn't have written it.,"Isaac Asimov would not have had to explain Hari Seldon or Dors Venabali, his text would have done that for him. This was not an easy read. I have enjoyed Isaac Asimov's writings for many years having been initiated by my father who took up reading Asimov's works from the 1940'S. My first book was ""Foundation and Earth"" and from there was addicted. These books made sense as Isaac Asimov wrote with easy prose, not he said, she said, they did. Books that were written, using Asimov's name after his death, are mere stories by amateurish wannabes. Regretfully, no one can imitate his style and description."
2,A WONDERFUL SURPRISING AND INTERESTING BOOK,"I am sooooo glad that this book was mentioned to me. My husband loves it as he learned a good trick: he wears expensive leather work gloves, the right hand ALWAYS wore out first, he had 9 left handed gloves laying around. The book told the story of a family that 'made do' with what they had during hard times. Turn the left hand glove inside out and you have a right hander. So many little things that this family did, I can still turn a shirt collar like my gramma taught me. A great and fine story during the Great Depression of an Iowa farm family with several children. I can remember polishing my little Patent leather shoes with Vaseline etc. I can see myself reading this again later on. It is a joy to read."
2,Very gritty sad urban drama,"Calista Flockheart as a druggie? Wow! Had to see that one and what a surprise it was. The story was well-paced and very realistic, almost documentary like. She is very believable as a drug abuser. Loved the soundtrack -- any album available in the future? Better than A Midsummer's Night Dream by a long shot."
1,Huh?,"1941 must have been a barren, rotten year for filmgoers. How else could this jumbled affair have won five Academy Awards? How Green Was My Valley is a fine film but in no way is it worthy of such praise. Did it stay true to the original novel? If so the original story isn't that good. What's up with the sister's marriage to the coal mine owner's son? Where in the heck did that come from? And Huw (played by Roddy McDowall at his most dimwitted) decides to become a coal miner? Huh? Shouldn't this story have been about the changing times and economy in Wales? Shouldn't it have been about transitions? About how the narrator went to school and escaped this dead-end trap of the coal mine? I'm Welsh in heritage; I really wanted to like this film. Do yourself a favor and skip this stinker."
1,Won't start with clips broken,"I loved this blender, and didn't have too much trouble with leaking until I had used it for several months. What caused me trouble? The clips on the bottom of the skirt snapped off. After they all fell off, suddenly the blender would not go on. I superglued them back on so that the sensor would allow it to start. Now I have three clips missing. As one falls off, I glue it back on. I realize this is to prevent the container flying off the base and redecorating the kitchen, but why so poorly made? This is a powerful motor!!"
1,"They're ok, but can be damaging","I purchased these screen protectors a while ago.... They work ok, but if your Jornada gets any tiny little invisible specks of dirt between the screen and the protector, you'll have scratches all over the place.... Just a warning....make sure you clean your Jornada before you place the protector on....and keep it clean.... Hope this helps!!!"
2,A Complicated Life,"Maybe it's because I'm not an English major or a writer, but I loved this penetrating biography. I was never bored by it and find it totally amazing that others were. Further, I'm a compulsive biography reader and would have been mystified by this life story if the unpleasant and sordid parts had been omitted. I was especially interested in the picture Milford drew of Millay's genious and how it manifested. It was also fascinating to read how the husband cared for her and seemed to understand what she needed to keep her talent alive. Alcohol and drug addiction have plagued many writers and artists of her generation and she was no exception. I think it's wise to remember that society knew very little about these illnesses then; once in their grip, Millay was probably doomed because she would have had little help available to her."
1,Fake Vampires and Flat Characters,"The book starts off with an interesting enough premise, but all the build up goes no where fast. The book is driven by plot and the characters are merely 'there' and have no actual effect on the story or reader. A big let down. I'm glad I didn't buy it."
1,stoooooooooooopid!!!!,"Sometimes DUMB is funny - here it's mostly just plain DUMB. Definitely in the top 10 of the ""worst films I have ever had the misfortune to see""..."
2,George Elliot's Romola,"In my opinion, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been to Florence. I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in. It seems to keep getting more and more dramatic and then concludes with a very satisfying ending."
2,Great Wine Safe,"This requires a strong person to put together, but it is sturdy and handsome and both keeps wine at the proper angle and locks it safely away."
1,Oh dear,"Please note this toy does not work with Thomas tracks. We bought it for my son's train track set and were disappointed that it was too big. I would have been OK with that, but no battery configuration that we tried ever got this to work! Sad toy."
1,don't play this game!,"I want to make one clear to you. Big Rigs is without a doubt the worst game of this generation! It claims to be a racing game about truck drivers who would race to deliver cargo from place to place while staying ahead of the law. That's what the game's box says. And it lies! there is no goal or story in Big Rigs. You just race from point a to point b, excuse me you drive from point a to point b. The truck you are supposed to be racing never leaves the starting gate! So you will win every time! Objects in the way? Don't worry, you can drive right through everything in your path. You can also accelerate forever. you can also clime vertical inclines with no trouble at all. you can even drive off into nothingness! I'll end by saying this: buying this game would be a waste of your hard- earned money!"
2,Excellent Device,"I have own Sony Microvaults since the 2 GB series. They have been proven to be reliable and fast. The Compression software is useful, but can not be utilized unless you are an administrator. Considering it is a sony product and the size of the device the price is excellent."
1,Very disappointed....,"Good luck with the instructions. Unit is cheap plastic and some of the main supports are ""snap on"". Still deciding if I'm going to put it in the car or throw it in the trash. If I do install it and it doesn't fall to pieces the first day, I'll be surprised."
2,Performs just as expected,This drill bit fits perfectly in my hammer drill and appears to be very durable. I have already used it to drill through cinder block walls as well as holes in concrete decks many times and there is very little wear that can be noticed. I am very satisfied with this purchase through Amazon.
1,Awful,"This book took me to the depths of boredom. The characters are all to typical and predictable. The story is mundane and without meaning. The author should get out of the bussiness. Although, the book does serve as a fine paperweight."
2,passion before profit,"I am ad admirer of Steve's previous books and his on line columnfor USA TODAY. I also have seen him speak in person. His insightinto today's small business marketplace is quite impressive.I think he sums up the entrepreneur philosophy with his phrase,Passion before Profit. If you do not have passion for yourwork, you will probably not see the profit you desire.I look forward to Steve's next publication."
2,Piece of PUnk History,"Well, this is truly one of the best Punk records ever! All the songs on it are awesome!"
2,WAHL Replacement Blade,"It was a much needed upgrade from the dulling blades I was using. Glad to have new blades, cuts like butter"
1,PAINFUL TO WATCH,"This movie had a nice idea but either the writer didn't carry the plot all the way through or the director held everyone back. Ever watch someone try to dance and you just know they're counting out their footsteps? Well, that's what this movie felt like. The characters never really clicked and the plot just fell apart. Anyone over the age of 6 will probably not want to see it."
1,Horror Collector's Set: Four Film Collection (Purchased on 03/26/2010) by Billy Zane,I have not received this selection yet. I hope you will be able to send it soon. Thanks Jeanet Zech
2,GREAT QUALITY,This is a high quality professional product. Just as described and a good price for an item that will last years to come.
2,My cat leaves my new couch alone,"My cat loves this post. I bought a new (expensive) couch and I was very concerned about him scratching it. I placed it in front of the couch and he is very happy to scratch it and not the furniture. I think it helps to have the post in the middle of the ""action"" so he can show off his scratching prowess."
2,A More Mature Gidget,"Gidget in Love? Gidget's always in love! Longer on plot and shorter on the nuances of narrative style than the early Gidget novels, this later entry reads more like your standard paperback, but is still a good read--especially for die hard Gidgephiles. Following ""The Affairs of Gidget"", Franzie comes home from OSU/Corvallis and transfers her credits to U.C.L.A.--this is because Jeff has completed his tour of service and is studying at Cal Tech. The relationship is rocky, though, and to prove a point, Gidget takes a job teaching at a small private school; she has of course, bitten off more than she can chew--if only she stopped there, but then how could she? More than she can chew has never been enough for Franzie Hofer. This is a more mature, less self absorbed Gidget, and it's good to see her do a little growing up."

1,Would NEVER own another one,"We bought our catgenie 6 months ago and so far we have replaced 2 motors, 1 bowl and the scooper arm. The only thing that we have NOT replaced is the base and I am sure that will be the next thing to go out. I have spent so much time on the phone with the technical support I am on a first name basis with Nora, the customer service representive. Customer support has been great. They always take the time to help me figure out what is wrong and they have sent out the replacement parts quickly. We have 3 cats, 2 of which spend at least a part of each day outside, so they should not over work the catgenie. However, I have to take the machine completely apart and work on it monthly because it is blowdrying cat feces. Which is a smell you cannot forget! I will say that when it works it is the best thing imaginable, but it does not work consistantly. For what it costs I would expect a much better built product. Thank God for a two year warranty!"
1,No Good,I love Gaiam products but I have to say I pump up the ball every time I go to work out and by the end of my workout I would need to add more air. It also includes a DVD and a VHS to give you a sample of the various exercises you can do using the ball. The VHS had no sound so I used the DVD and it was very short and didn't give me a good enough tast. This package is definatly not worth the money.
1,my dear liz phair...,"The thing I (used to) love about Liz Phair's music is that at first you don't really like it and then you listen and listen and it grows and grows on you. Every song on this album was easy listening - bad sign. I can't get the songs out of my head and I want to!If she'd only not had such lame backing music and vocal synthesis I think the album would be OK - it's as though she wrote these interesting tunes with her guitar and handed them over to her producers saying ""butcher me, baby!"".It's really disapointing - at best, a wider audience will be attracted to her music now and she might get some more worthy recognition for her brilliant first three albums."
2,Love it!,This is one of my favorite videos. It's great and you can do it at your own level which is wonderful. I definitely recommend it.
2,Great Book for Fetish overview,This is a great book to learning about the fetish and easy to understand and follow along. It is great for a beginner in the lifestyle of Handler/dog..
2,Great Video!!!,"This is a beginner to intermediate video as far as belly dance goes. As far as a workout goes, this is just great. BUT I must tell you, this might as well be called Introduction to Props, Veil and Cane, because that is what you are getting along with this dancing workout! I highly recommend this to my students! Tanna is clear in her presentations and I especially like her folkloric style. The performance section is beautiful. World Dance New York's DVDs have good video and sound quality and the instruction in basic veil and cane on this one make it worth well over the purchase price!!! I would buy the DVD instead of just watching on demand because I like to have the really good ones to pop in anytime I like. Maybe you want to watch it first, but you will probably want to buy it after!"
2,"great book, made me cry","This was a very good book. It had that certain sadness to it of wanting someone you can't have. It dragged somewhat, but it picked up and had a great ending."
1,A bad film.,Not a good movie. the only thing that makes it viewable is the performances by the actors like Denis Quaid. Recomondation: Avoid.
1,Amazon - please stop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Amazon has the potential to be so much more. How do they allow stuff like this to sell? Smell was 110% repulsive. Positive reviewers could only work for the company. Sending them back. Costs me time and Amazon money. Just a dumb dumb product.
1,Like a train wreck you can't stop staring at...,"Did they REALLY expect us not to notice that they used a Vietnam era UH-1 helicopter in the desert of Afghanistan post 9-11? I watched this all the way through to see where it was going but it ended up going off into some 60's style psychedelic mess...I guess that's where they got the Huey. Their so-called special forces unit bears no resemblance to an actual military unit with squad members asking, ""You sure that's a good idea Chief,"" almost every time they're given an order. And special forces do NOT shoot randomly into the air at an enemy that nobody can see...I hope. The ""special effects"" could have been done on my laptop from 20 years ago and likely were. There was no real explanation of who or what they were encountering in the desert and they showed zero survival instinct after getting lost without provisions. Other than that I really liked it."
1,LEAKS LITTER!!!,"For the life of me, I can't seem to clean this litter box without having litter spill everywhere on the floor! It is awful! I am going back to the old scoop the poop method! Save you money!"
1,WRONG COLOR SENT,"When I came across the BOCA RATON STRIPE pad/cover, I was excited to order a fun pattern (as pictured with bold orange stripes). However, what I received was an altogether DIFFERENT brand (""Whitney Design"") in a TOTALLY DIFFERENT pattern (""April Stripe"", which is blue, yellow and green stripes). I went ahead and returned the pad/cover, requesting a replacement be issued in the correct color/style (BOCA RATON). AGAIN, I received the INCORRECT pattern in April Stripe (not even listed!). I can't speak to the other patterns offered, but if you're contemplating ordering the ""Boca Raton Stripe"" I would beware! The customer service person was rather apologetic, but I'm still out a cover/pad and have had the burden of making two trips to the post office to make the returns."
2,Interesting film,"""The Misfits"" boasts an all-star cast and an interesting, if unusual story. The script has a few holes in it, but the colorful characters keep you watching. The last scene of Marilyn and Gable looking up at the stars as they drive home is hypnotic and powerful. It caused me to remember that both of these legends never completed another film, and that neither lived much longer after the movie was finished."
2,Great Album!,"I like this album because it is a classic record from the ""hair metal"" era. The only thing is, it has too much of a metal crunch. Of course, it is Alice who has changed with the times repeatedly. Maybe not well commercially, I still enjoy it."
1,I'M SO DISAPOINTED,"FOR ME BEING AN VERY DIVERSE MUSIC FAN[AND LONG TIME DMB FAN],I was very disapointed with EVERYDAY.Where's the rawness andjazzy vibe of BEFORE THESE CROWDED STREETS? And what's up withthe synthizers,pop sappiness,and blandness.Glen Ballard[EVERYDAY's mastermind] may work well with average-soundingartists like Alanis Morrisette.But Dave Matthews' moan,Tinsley'svoilin,and Carter Beauford's precise drums are all the ""production"" they need.""The Space Between"" is bland andpop but it is pretty and grows on you.My favorites on this albumare ""Mother Father"" and the title track.That's when I actuallyheard the real Dave Matthews Band become the Dave Matthews Bandagain.EVERYDAY isn't horrid but it is a disapointment to a lot ofDMB's fans!"
1,Ditto Los Angeles,"Couldn't agree with Los Angeles more. I rarely give up on a book, but Joy Sterling is so annoyingly self-absorbed (she writes that on her wedding day no one could go out for a decent meal because most of America's great chefs were at her party) that I became too disgusted to continue. Too bad, because the story of growing and bottling wine is an interesting one, and she doesn't tell it poorly. Anyone who finds space in a book about wine to describe her own birthday as being ""on the order of an intergalactic holiday,"" however, is drastically overestimating her audience's interest in the pretentious details of her life."
1,"OMG, Really?! This is trash!","This is the best example of how a big household name like Trump can be used to market and over price products that are truly shameful and rubbish. I could not believe the contents of this Cds. I thought higher of Mr. Trump's products before listening to these videos. I was fortunate enough to resell it rapidly on Amazon's marketplace and did not loose much money. The name, the marketing and the packaging will lead you to believe you are buying a great product, but honestly this is not. I beleive this is my only one star review for an Amazon product in years, but this one, truly deserves it. Two stars on it would be overselling its virtues! Very incompetent and over priced!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"I purchased not one but two separate copies of the DVD. When the DVD is inserted a caption reads ""input code, parental violation"". Huh?Both DVDs created the same problem for my late-model GE digital DVD. Called the distributor. Waste of time, they blamed my player. Yikes!"
2,a lovly cllection for Jane Austen fans.But...,"These movies are great but i was really dissapointed with Perrsuasion! In outside films,they used real film ,inside, they used plain tapes.Also, the casting was all wrong with perrsuasion. Also, the captins didn't were their uniforms which, backthen, was incorrect. Overall, the rest were nice movies."
1,Does not help at all,"I actually returned this book because it had very little , if anything, to do with WHY you actually compulsively eat. it did not go into or even explained the psychological factors that influence C.O. all this book talk about is how women's self-image is polluted with diet ads etc, etc. it does not deal at all with how to actually stop, in an effective way.same thing as Overcoming Overeating. the whole point of the book is to stop dieting and to stop having a dieting mentality. also it doe snot deal with the actual cause of you overeating ( which is not dieting)if you really want to overcome overeating and end your obsession with food, you need to know why you are physiologically addicted to food. why you find so much pleasure in it. and for that you have to read books with substantial research, not just a feminist sound-off.read : the pleasure trap, LIfe is hard- food is easy , to name a few good ones.but this one and her other one won't help you at all."
1,Even my Grandson Became Bored with this Movie,"Okay, this movie is supposed to be about three teen boys. However, I didn't know this when I tried to watch it with my grandson, and they looked to me like twenty-somethings who had never grown up. I guess they did to my grandson as well because, although he talks frequently about skatboarding when he gets a little older, he lost interest in the movie barely a third of the way through it. I felt the same about it - it was intensely boring to me to watch what looked like a bunch of immature guys doing their thing. Maybe if one is really into skateboarding this movie might be of interest. For me, and for my grandson, it wasn't worth the time spent watching it."
1,Caution,I've been Crocheting for over ten years but a friend wanted me to make the Irish Lattis pattern. And I found a ton of mistakes. The way they have the pattern written does not match the picture at all and they tell you that the wrong side of the afghan is the right side sometimes. I wouldn't suggest getting this book unless you have a little more experience and can easily fix the problems otherwise you might get very confused with the instructions. I'm assuming since that pattern is so off there are mistakes in the other designs as well.
2,A warm return...,"When all around seems to fall very short, there evolves a nostalgia from the depths of blockbuster lack-lustre. Daniel Craig surprises you with an edgy hark back to the style which suits him so well and, not so surprisingly, afforded him the darker 007 he performs. If you're a Brit from the 70's, then this will sadden you as it brings home just what we had then. At the same time it will also light a old flame of those days, which you may have missed!Attention to detail here makes this a pleasure to watch and with a soundtrack to match, although the soundtrack could have been deeper in volume, rather than reflection. Some nudity and adult scenes, necessary for the context of the plot, which don't offend.A great Sunday afternoon watch and one to recommend."
2,Doreen Virtue adds to the enjoyment of this audio book...,Great book. Love the audio. Doreen brings her character to life. This is a nice book to use for helping with understanding A Course In Miracles.
1,West Ben Digital timer,The controls on this timer work backward to others I have used. It's kind of a nuisance. I tried to reset it the other day and I had to wait until the time ran out before I could put a new time in.
2,India,I think this book was great. It shows the way life was in India during the British control. It was good. It couldnt of been more correctly writen. Forester was a great writer that captured the essaence of india.
2,Beautifully written ...,"This book has depth. It's not an easy, forgettable summer read. Like the last two, it blends together issues that teens can relate to with emotion and catchy writing (I actually remember lots of quotes and lines from this book). The characters are so real, I feel like if I go to Bethesda, I will actually be able to find all four of them (or at least their homes, considering they're all in college). It all feels that real. It's an amazing, heart-warming, tear-jerking book that didn't make me necessarily feel happy at the end. More like thoughtful. Like I've been part of something that's important. Read it."
1,I Don't Get It,"What is this music? I actually don't even give this one star. I mean the lead singer's voice sometimes sounds like a child's. It's weird. A lot of times you can't even understand what he's saying. This is definetly the weirdest band I've ever heard. If you want good rock stick to the All-American Rejects they're really good and have great vocals, they're so much better than this band. This band is just plain weird."
1,Mindless Entertainment,"The Klone And I is a silly story of a love triangle between Stephanie,Peter and Peter's clone,Paul.The novel is simply outrageous and provides mindless entertainment.Too bad that this book got published.This is arguably the worst Danielle Steel novel I have ever read."
2,The Perfect Purple Cow,"This book was recommended to me by several marketing collegues as a must read. I became a fan of Seth's work after reading this book. He addresses being different, thinking different and marketing different are keys to standing out and being noticed. I already was a believer in this philosophy, but Seth's numerous examples, enjoyable writing style and wit made this book a wonderful read. I think this is a must have book for any marketing person or entrepreneur. Once you read it, you will get hooked as a fan of Seth's style, and message. This book encourages you to examine what you are doing or not doing to be a leader in your industry. It challenges you to think outside the box, and create extraordinary campaigns, messages and results. We don't live in a world that allows ordinary to last very long. If you want to prosper, you will need to become the purple cow!"
2,Good comedy movie with mindless entertainment,"Tower Heist is a very funny movie with good comedical actors doing very funny movie roles. The movie has many funny moments, a few slow parts in between the funny parts, but the good acting saved the movie in my viewpoint. But if your just looking for a mindless entertainment movie to waste some time one night then pick this movie up and have a few laughs here and there with the actor Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy. Plus the supporting cast made the movie even more enjoyable. So sit back and enjoy a good evening with good comedical movie."
1,BOOOOOOOORINGGGGGGG,I only finished the book because i paid money for it. Don't waste the money... I should have returned it as soon as i got a few chapters in but i was hoping it'd get better as i read further... boy was i wrong. :(
2,A Powerful Film,"This movie was wonderful. Part of the story is a father/child relationship similar to but more powerful than in Mrs. Doubtfire. Parts of the movie are quite sad, but the joy of Georges (a man with Down syndrome) shines through. The film gently touches on uncomfortable subjects such as the close friendship of two men, and ends up as a hilarious, heart-warming experience."
1,wheel exist not pelican though,"To John and James, I've seen a wheel advertised at team x-box.com its made by Fanatec it looks like a great wheel maybe this is the product you are hoping to order since pelican does'nt seem to know about a wheel like this......"
1,Wild Highland Rose,"I love to read and I love to read historical romance novels that are set in Scotland, but this book was almost painful to get through. I think this is one of the worst books that I have ever read. It was flat and boring. I felt nothing for the hero, heroin, or the solution to the plot. I think the publisher must have printed the author's first draft by mistake"
1,"Not much new info for me, but good for younger person possibly","The first couple chapters were interesting, but then it seemed like something I might have found useful about 15 years ago. If you have read any of the more popular PUA books or social dynamic stuff, this is way on the novice end in comparison. Also it is co-written by a woman, so if you are interesting in using it to meet women, it is mostly useless. There were some good bits of info, such as what men find attractive vs what women do, but seems like a better read for a high school age person just learning to talk to girls."
2,Best tv show eveeeeer,Loved loved loved it. Good show and great quaality of the dvds . I. Totally recommend it. Fast shipment. .
2,"""killing me softly""","this cd is amazing. I bought it about 7 months ago and i'm still trying to listen to the cd in full. the mourning vocals make the music seem to drag at times, but if your patient you get some very cool driving beats. This is a must get for any radiohead fan!"
2,Interesting world rock music - Native artist,"Filed sometimes under New Age Music but actually would consider this World Music. Pretty good, am surprised that more people have not caught on. This native award winning band is a multicultural asset.Intersting and unique- various slower harmonic/fast paced rock includes drums, flute, guitar, piano in modern and pulsating arrangement, some tracks peaceful and serene. Mainly instrumental with vocal enhancement. Give it a try.. it will take you to another land."
1,Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read,"This book is a mess. I am amazed that it had 100,000 copies printed. It's supposed to be a thriller but the plot is transparent and predictable. It's supposed to be erotic but it was more like 4th rate porn.But the worst was the terrible writing. The author loses track of a couple of scenes. Meanings are lost in murky language that seems to be an attempt at great writing but comes across as a parody.I'm glad I bought the book used. I don't want anyone to ever pay for this copy again so I'm going to leave it lying at the airport or in a coffee shop with a warning inside the front cover."
2,The First Lady Has No Peers,"This is a terrific boxed set of, perhaps the greatest female country singer of all time. She certainly had the voice, the right inflection, the material, the producer (the great Billy Sherrill in his prime) and the husband (all-time legend George Jones). Current ""country"" singers today can't hold a candle; I would only deduct one star because if I was doing the compilation, I'd have included less 80's-period stuff and more of the 60's/70's material that's missing...like ""There Goes That Steel Guitar"", or some of the Christmas LP original songs, or better, some of the more obscure duets with then-husband, George Jones, like the classic ""We Believe In Each Other""...but no matter, most of this is REALLY GREAT stuff from a really great traditional country singer. Looking forward to her estate finally giving permission to release all of those very solid LPs from the 1970's (so we can finally hear songs like ""I L-O-V-E-Y-O-U"" again). Here's to the REAL First Lady..."
2,Excellent,"This album is where she found her niche (in my opinion). This was her most grown-up sounding album (at the time) and was the first to feature heavy writing credits from Madonna herself. There are a lot of gems on this CD, even some non singles:True BlueWhite HeatJimmy JimmyPapa Don't Preackto name a few..."
1,Glad my kids don't like it either!,"All I can say is I'm glad my kids hate Junie B as much as I do. I helped regularly at my school library, and some kindergartners would come up to the counter to check these out and say how much they like Junie B. because she uses words like ""stupid"" and ""dumb"" etc, etc. Junie is rude, and everything out of her mouth is incorrect grammer. Not an occassional ""slip"" - constant! Is this the way you want your kids to talk and behave? If the answer is no, find another series. My kids LOVED the I Can Read series, than Magic Tree House, or there's Arthur chapter books, or the Flat Stanley series. Would not reccomend any of these."
1,Just Ok,I started out interested in this book but couldn't make it through. It just didn't hold my interest.
1,Would be funny if kids werent involved.,"One of the most sick and twisted books I have ever read (part of, couldnt stomach the rest) and no... I did not pay for it. This woman is seriously in need of help. She tries to make a buck by sharing her techniques for dominating, humiliating, and abusing her three children. And why would one read this and take her advise?? Does she hold any certificates or degrees in child education or development. N0! She is a has-been sitcom actress, from some show no one can even remember turned quasi-religious preacher. The only thing this woman seems to know about children and religion is how to exploit them both."
1,Yaawn,"Oh, sorry, I fell asleep! Had a hard time staying awake threw this one. Just seems like another novel with a happy little ending, Ho...Humm... so predictable! It would have been nice to see real life struggles, such as, due to her ex husband not paying taxes, the IRS came after her, resulting in putting a lean on her home, took her IRA account, (retirement fund) and lost her job! What in the world would she do then along with her inner turmoil with her sister death and fathers meaness. If we are going to have problems,lets have some real ones (money) that we all can relate to!"
2,Revered,"As I sit here, fresh in the wake of The Lovely Bones, I wonder how to put into words what this book has done for me. This book filled me and then drained me, over and over again. I have genuine and lasting cares for every character in this novel. I find myself wondering ""what became of the love that could have been and the love that was?"" Sebold is perpetually honest and empathetic when describing her characters. It seems she loves them as much as I do. The Lovely Bones is, how the late Susie Salmon described her first kiss- ""a beautiful gasoline rainbow"". Bittersweet from beginning to neverend."
1,It died way too fast!,"I purchased this battery at March 14, 2010. In last 2-3 months it started to show signs of weakening - quickly self discharging and can't hold capacity well. Yesterday, after full owernight charge with specified original charger, it was only to able to drive 3 screws into plywood.Very shame for a battery made in japan and costing $60!Just for comparison, in January I bought Black & Decker FS130 battery (which is same as dewalt, but 1.2ah capacity) and it still works flawlessly!"
1,Neither Accurate or Precise,"I brought this scale so I could read the meter w/o glasses, and because it looked good. However, with some use it became apparent either the scale or my body wasn't functioning propoerly. I have access to calibrated weights, and found that after weighing a 50.0 lb weight multiple times over different days, that it was the scale wasn't working. The weight had values ranging between 50.4 to 52 lbs, an error of 1-4%. Given that my diet was calling for a loss of 2 lbs a week, that was an unacceptable error. What was worst was that the scale's precision was terrible. One day yielded 5 straight readings of 51.0 lbs. The following day yielded 50.4. The day after that returned mixed results of 50.4 (2x) and 51.8 (3x). Thinking that perhaps an uneven floor may be causing problems, I carefully placed the in a set spot, and repeated the tests. One day saw values of 50.4 lbs, and the next saw 52-51.8 lbs. At this point I gave up. Avoid this scale."
2,"high energy sundtracks, another perfect from warner t.v.","For those delving into euro dance, the two top producers of quality club music are telstar t.v., and warner t.v.. This paticular compilation has 3 c.d,s packed with high energy sound. Telstar t.v. produced clublife 2 1998, which is also outstanding."
1,Yuck!,"Truly this movie is horribly lame. And you know what the real killer is? At the end of the movie one of the characters- Ranger Bob said: ""Don't worry about me. I'll be back next year."" Is he implying a sequel? Holy God!!!"

1,Very disappointing,"Red Dragon- excellent, SOTL - brilliant, Hannibal - waste of paper What a disappointment. The psychological picture of Lector built up in the previous books has been ruined by this sequel. If I didn't know better I'd say it was written by someone else. It started promisingly but just deteriorated into an extremely unlikely, dissatisfying conclusion."
2,91xG hdtv antenna,"Shipping was pretty good, everything packed well; when I went to put it together everything was fine till I mounted the elements on the boom, the elements where loose they moved around in the wind, so I had to put little plastic wedges in the element clips so they where snug on the boom. The element problem made it a little disappointing.I get all the Los Angeles HDTV channels with a pre-amp I have a hill between me and Mount Wilson I live in Sylmar SFV"
2,a valuable resource for any mystery shopper,"I wrote this for the book after reading an advance copy.""Forget the hype about making big money, eating for free and taking cruises. Here you get the truth and well-researched advice on what can be a great career or profitable spare-time hobby.""-Raymond F. Sola, Founder and President Volition.com LLC"
1,I didn't like it.,This game has pretty good graphics but the gameplay sucks. It is so hard to aim because you have to use the D-pad and the joystick at the same time in order to aim while moving. They should of made it like Golden Eye (james bond) where you move with the joystick and you hold down a trigger to aim. The missions are just going around shooting people then collecting a coin after you kill them. And the arenas are tiny. If you like little Deathmatch games with the most annoying aimer I would suggest it. But if you have a nintendo stick to Goldeneye and Perfect Dark.
2,Classic early 80's synth-rock.,"Tony Carey is an excellent songwriter and his talents shine on Plant P. Technology and outer space are the main theme, heavy synthesizers and guitar, intelligent lyrics, strange twists... Early 80's MTV type stuff, a must have for any true fan of 80's rock."
2,THE WAY OF ALL FLESH was a surprisingly insightful novel.,"THE WAY OF ALL FLESH is full of insightful generaliztions abou the human race embellished in a character which is so well-developed that the reader can feel pity for him for the situations which he is eveloped in are ones that we can be trapped in everyday. I used this book for an independent novel study (Grade 11) and would like to reccomend it to all students who are to be doing such a project, especially if the subject has to do with irony."
1,Robert Altman at his weirdest,"This film is evocative of the quirky, madcap Robert Altman at his best and worst. We got it because we have a Bud Cort fan in the family, and just to see him makes it worth it. But the story is strange, resolution less than satisfying. If you're really a big Altman or Cort fan, then you must see it. Just be aware that THIS IS NOT A WESTERN! (I had it confused with John Wayne's ""Rooster Cogburn"" and the Dennis Weaver's ""McCloud"" and kept waiting for it to start, thinking I was seeing more previews.) The storyline combines an oddball who lives in unauthorized apartment in the basement of the Astrodome who is trying to fly, with a murder mystery and detective story. This is one of Shelly Duvall's early roles -- don't miss her upside-down false eyelashes!"
2,A new insite,"I love this book and it's indepth new, to me at least, outlook on how it is we FEEL love, and how to learn to express love to others we care about in learning their language.There are a few people I've talked to that tell me that once you get to know a person intamatly all over, there really isn't ONE love language that stands out. BUT for the rest of us people who aren't in such relationships and are still learning to GET there. It's a great book to keep the GOOD feelings of acceptance and love open, available, and expressed."
1,"0 stars... this ""music"" is dumb... just dumb.","This guy is talentless. He's on MTV yet mocks MTV. Hypocrite. He writes songs about himself and how hard his life is/was. Redundant. He writes songs about people that don't like him/he doesn't like. Boring. The songs are stale, the beats are wannabe, and the voice/lyrics are really stupid. Eminem is for kids who don't know any better. If you are an adult and you own Eminem, shame on you.Eminem has opened the flood gates for MTV manufactured, talentless posers who seem to want to just look tough yet cute and sing about how hard life is and use the same sounds over and over again in each ""song"". Please throw away your Eminem material. Don't sell it, just toss it."
1,"Go on Wind, BE Gone","The Wind done Gone is a good way to describe this story. I am no fan of Gone with the Wind and I know this was supposed to be the untold story, but I couldn't follow this story at all. Lady, Planter,Cynara, Corinne, whoever else, I could not get straight. Cinnamon and R, What? Honestly I think that you have to be a real Gone with the Wind fan to understand the story of The Wind Done Gone. Maybe a publishing of the original diaries may help, or maybe if Alice Randall would have changed the dialect and made it more of a story form, than a diary setting, I may have understood it better. If you are a history buff orvery curious as to why they fought to publish this story, you may be intrigued by its contents, unfortunately it left too many questions for me, oh and mind you I am not a fan of Gone with the Wind."
1,"Boring, dated, juvenile","There was nothing in this book to draw you in: the characters are one-dimensional, the plot is laborious, and the dialogue is dated, preachy and long-winded. It is also notably misogynistic. I recommend spending time and money on something more worthwhile."
2,Is the best Metroid game ever!... wait till Metroid 4 GBA,"When it came out i didnt hesitate on buying it cause i owned it on nintendo and on Gameboy and it was a challenging and puzzling game.Now this one has more of the story into it and has a lot of action and motivation into playing it.I have been a Metriod fan since i was 8 yrs old back in 1990 and never changed, im just waiting for metroid 4 for Gameboy Advance to come out and im 19 yrs old. Ive been waiting a while for the next sequel from super nintendos super metroid. I recomend this one before playing metroid 4"
2,Wonderful too Watch!,I Just Love watching Touched By an Angel series! I wish they would Release the Other Five Seasons!!
2,The Madman's Return,"I listened to this stuff all the time when I was little and I still enjoy it now. It is like a mix of techno, dance, electronica, and hip-hop all blended into one sound. I like the lyrics of most songs are the beats are crazy techno stuff that still sounds great today. My personal favorites of the album are:1.Rhythm Is a Dancer2.See the Light3.Madman's Return4.Who Stole It?"
2,Shoes of the fisherman,"The ""Shoes of the Fisherman"" is not only a very dramatic film but a very educational one as well. The movie depicts the sequence of events leading up to the election of a pope. Many catholics and non-catholics alike do not know the procedurs envolved in electing a pope. The writers could not have picked a more dramatic actor in Anthony Quinn. I have found the movie very heart warming and moving. I have watched the movie 3 times already. I highly recommend this movie to all."
2,Great begining book!,"I grew up learning many sight words from this book, and it belonged to my cousin before me! It was one of my favorites. I can still remember ""Up Spook Hill...""I am very excited to see this book still in print so that I can get it for my child, my copy is a little worn after many years in storage!"
1,AWFUL,"This has to be the worse Christmas movie I have ever seen. The acting was terrible, Hepburn was so bad, I couldn't watch her....it just made me sad.There was no emotion to the story...I just didn't care.Let's put it this way....I set up my tree first, then watched the movieAfter the movie was over I took my tree down!"
1,Casing cracked after eight months,"The filter generally worked well but the casing to the filter cracked after eight months of use. It's possible that, when inserting the filter, we stressed the plastic casing to some extent but the crack opened under water pressure alone. The return window expired six months ago."
2,Best One Yet,"I really hated to see this very funny series go !! I think season four was one of the best ones out there !! Season 1 was a great starter, but the prison and coma segments in season 2 and 3 were not super entertaining. Season 4 went back to the roots of 1, but much more refined. You can finally find out why Crabman went into witness protection !! None of the folks I work with enjoyed the show, so I had no one to talk to about the shows. I just enjoyed them myself."
2,"Hot, Hot, Hot!","The title of this video says it all...If you like sensual and shapely curves on tanned bodies, you will love this new video by Playboy. Beautiful women grace beginning to end of this tape. I can't wait for a sequel...HOT!"
2,~&#9835;~,"This is one of the most strikingly, disarmingly true messages to come out in music for a long time, on this scale.The remixes will have your brain soaring through the landscapes of the universe, oneness, and love.It's an amazing single, with an amazing video, that will provide you with an amazing, 4 dimensionally techno experince.No words can properly define it.Buy it!:>"
2,Perfect!!,These brackets fit perfect!! They are the newest model that fit either round or square bars. Work great on my Thule rack.
1,chicano rap is garbage,"chicano rap is garbage, stick to the realness of hip hop like common , tribe called quest, the roots, KRS ONe and etc"
2,collection of knitting styles/techniques from all over,I really enjoyed this book. it can be read for knowledge or to learn how to do the techniques. The history of the different styles is given as well as the how-tos from fair isle to tvaandsstickning(that's how it is really spelled) to shetland lace. It is a great into to different ways to knit. I would recomend it to anyone who wants to expand their base of knowledge(sorry if I sound like a teacher).
1,grandma,"I bought this item for my daughter-in-law. This bassinet is beautiful online. When it arrived and we proceeded to put it together one of the side pieces had two left legs instead of a left leg and a right leg. We had to redrill all holes in order for it to match. Also one of the rails were broken.(poorly packaged) Also I do not like the exposed meatal screws on top railing of bassinet, very tacky looking. Canopy does not fit properly. Also sheet was thread bare, I'm afraid to wash it."
1,Junk,"I would have thought that ""Natural Bodybuilding"" means bodybuilding without chemicals, including exotic supplements. But various participants in this book describe substantial supplement routines, including one fellow who says he took (at date of writing) androstenedione and a staggering 453 grams of protein daily(!!!). Another contributor describes Cort-Bloc; yet another talks about taking effervescent creatine, insulin mimickers, androgen precursors, HMB, etc. This is ""Natural""???Too much of the bodybuilding industry rides on profits made from pitching exotic substances whose long-term effects on human beings is unknown. The hard reality is that truly natural bodybuilding will not make you look like the full-time fitness models (who always look vaguely ill to me), unless you have incredible genetic gifts.Save your money."
2,VX-3000 is a great cam for the price!,The pack is a great deal. The pic quality is good and appropriate for the price point. Worked perfectly with Skype without any problems (in XP and Fedora 9). Got it to work within Fedora 9 but pic quality is definitely degraded.Definitely recommend.
1,Another Boring Dud,"It Starts like a campy horror flick...should have stayed that way......The acting by all was average at best,except the the high camp of Cary Elwes which was awful....Almost zero suspense..Anyone could figure that this turkey was going nowhere.The very end where a new video was dropped through a door slot was the typical surprise ending repeated over and over in a thousand cheesy horror flicks...Poor and boring trash."
2,THUNDERBALL!!!,Thunderball was a very action packed 007 movie. A lot of girls took place in it but still looked like it was very good. GET IT NOW. Hoped you like this review.
1,THE WORST,"This is the worst game guide book I have ever seen. It is lacking in screen shots, map explanations...everything. The only reason I am giving it one star is because that is the lowest the ratings go. Dino Crisis is a game where you need a little help...and this book offers little. I would suggest going with Prima Publishing...either that or head to Adrenaline Vault...both have much MORE to offer than this waste of money."
1,Warning,"I suggest readers check the bestseller lists and mainstream reviews for themselves because this is a third-rate thriller by an author who had an attack of self-importance while writing it. I thought the idea here is to express an opinion, not attack and discredit those who think this book is awful."
1,No cables are provided!,"I haven't actually set the thing up yet, but just a warning... I received the KVM switch but not any USB KVM cables as listed in the product description and on the manufacturer's website. When I contacted the company (PC Universe), they told me to return it for a refund, which isn't very helpful and doesn't solve my problem.I am still trying to work this out with their customer service. Buyer beware!"
1,Shoddy,"First one came in with a broken switch and totally would not work. Second one works but feels like its going to break soon. Boy, I'm glad my S&W; pistol is not made shoddy like this. I use flashlights EVERY day. I'm a LAN tech that's been using small flashlights for 20 years. I always thought the mini-mag was unbeatable but I like the 3 LED Coast that I carry with me now. Don't buy this flashlight, you'll be sorry.On the plus side, Amazon did the return in a very professional manner. I'm very happy with the way Amazon does buisness. I rarely shop anywhere else on line."
1,Nothing original,"Picking and choosing from various sources, Lawler has a knack for choosing the most trite material. Nothing original here."
2,StillWillis will rock your face off,"StillWillis, Philadelphia's premier acid folk band, is awesome. nuff said. buy this cd."
2,"Ray Stevenson as Punisher, Colin Salmon as Eye Candy","Movies like this are why people should read reviews before purchasing. It should have been no surprise about the violence if you were familiar with the graphic novels. I don't normally go for such violent and gory films, but I like watching Stevenson and Salmon so I gave it a chance. At least it's not brainless, hence my 4-star rating. There a plot and a purpose to this film. And, the ending is okay. Not recommended for the faint of heart."
1,Don't like these,They are coated with an awful feeling lubricant. Don't buy these. Durex Extra Sensitive are way better than these.
2,Fantastic machine!,I love this sewing machine! The speed levels are great for when I need to sew slowly and quietly or for whizzing through projects. It's a breeze to operate and as always the Brother manual is extremely helpful. The only thing that I'm not completely satisfied with is the needle threader. It doesn't always line up with the eye of the needle and I have to push it sideways. It makes threading the needle very awkward and frustrating.
2,A Solid Prog CD,"I have yet to be disappointed in anything done by Spocks Beard. Their songs are beautifully constructed and the musicianmanship/vocals are superb. You can't help but listen to this group and hear a uniquely American expression of the genius of Gentle Giant. Spocks Beard successfully blends elements of rock, fusion and classical sensibilities."
1,Where's the plot?,"This is a really bad movie. No one could act not even Tom Cruise, the writer must have been drunk when he wrote it, and it seems that whole movie was just trying to look like The Matrix only this movie has no plot.I mean this movie shouldn't even be listed as the sequal. Mission Impossible 1 always kept you guessing, you never knew what was going to happen next, but in this one you always know whats going to happen. What's that oh another rubber mask HO HUM!!!!!all in all the only impossible mission here is trying to stay awake! BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK"
2,Good Upgrade Study guide,"Let's keep in mind that Microsoft deliberately chooses to ask questions from the core study areas, rather than the methods used for the NT MCSE exams. Therefore, no single manual will be enough as by its nature each study guide covers only ONE subject. Having taken the exam, I can say that your success will depend on your preparation and EXPERIENCE. I STRONGLY advise that you purchase the CORE study set before taking even one exam. This is the whole objective behind Microsoft's plan for the MCSE 2000 certification. To this end, this manual is very good - and Sybex's Core study guides. As usual, if you have any questions use the ON-Line manual with the software to further your preparation where needed. I wish you all luck.Patrick Diaz MACP, MCSE+I, MCDBA"
2,A Lighthearted Romance Novel With Some Humor Added,This is another of Evanovich's lighthearted romance novels. It is a quick fun read.
1,May as well enter 'my' vote...,"Even though I've personally burned all seasons onto DVD from TV dubs from the 80's, I'm with everyone else here.Screw streaming and downloads. Give us the rest of the series on high-quality dvd's!MGM is 'not' a stupid company, yet expecting people to watch crappy low-res copies is an insult."
1,FAKE!!!!!,"This is a fake product with a fake scent. I received the package and the ""made in China"" sticker was cut out and over it you see a small ""made in Italy"" label. Spend 10 more dollars and buy the real thing at a local store. The scent was terrible, the bottle was wrong, the scent did not stay. Terrible item and Terrible Seller!"
2,Family Fun,"This is a great game for family game night. I used it to get my parents used to playing the Wii. It's a bit more advanced in its entirety than the Wii Play games (bowling, tennis, etc.) It allows someone who is not used to the Wii, let alone video game consoles, to progress to other games like Zelda or Mario Cart.The appeal of this game is that the basic board game play is easy and intuitive. It's simple enough to learn and it keeps newbies involved no matter how good or bad they are doing. The mini-games at the end of each round are always fun. There are so many different mini-games that it's rare the same one is picked twice. These games show off the many unique traits of the Wii-mote controller and is a perfect launch pad to more advanced games.Highly recommended for family game night."
1,Errors in book detract from its value,"Nice photos, but how much faith can you put into the text when simple errors stick out like sore thumbsFor instance:Man Called X: Ken Thurston did not have a girlfriend and had nothing to do with the Cafe Tamborine (that was an entirely different program.)Jack Moyles did NOT replace Frank Sinatra as Rocky Fortune. That series ended when Sinatra left it. Moyles DID star in Rocky Jordan, an entirely different show.It is little things like this and make the book suspect for me. How many more errors are in this book? What can one take as fact and not with a grain of salt?Excellent concept, faulty execution. I would not buy this book again and am considering returning my copy for credit. I do not consider this book to be a valuable reference item. Casual reading yes...reference work...no"
2,Really Good Entertainment for this Cinephile,"Really good entertainment for this cinephile. I said that because I've learned that everyone sees them differently and I should not recommend movies, but I wanted to rate the film because I enjoyed it from start to finish. (That's more than the required twenty words, isn't it?)"
2,NEW FOUND GLORY ROCKS MY SOCKS OFF,"NEW FOUNG GLORY IS THE COOLEST BAND EVER!!!!!! ALL OF THEIR CDS ARE EXTREMLY WELL MADE AND VERY UNIQUE, BUT THIS ONE IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE I'VE HEARD YET. THEY EXPERIMENTED WITH A NEW ""HEAVIER"" APPROACH TO THEIR SONGS LIKE ""ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE"", AND ""YOUR BIGGEST MISTAKE"", WHILE AT THE SAME TIME,EXPERIMENTING WITH SOFTER VERSIONS, LIKE ""I DON'T WANNA KNOW"" AND ""WHO AM I"". THEY ALSO HAVE MANY SONGS WITH THAT TRADIONAL ""NEW FOUND GLORY SOUND"". I DEFINATLY THINK YOU SHOULD GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD IMMEDIATLY. P.S. THAT GUY WHO WROTE THE REVIEW ""OMG, these guy's suck!!!!"" NEEDS TO SHUT UP. I THINK HE'S A POSER BECAUSE HE THINKS HE'S TOO COOL TO LISTEN TO NEW FOUND GLORY AND SIMPLE PLAN. PEACE OUT"
1,I Can't Believe It's Not Fiction,"Rips is an entertaining writer but few words in this book ring true. A town of 5,000 people in Italy where all the old folks (and others) speak English and a foreigner who speaks no Italian gets the whole scoop and makes great friends in a few months?Truly unbelievable. The book started sounding made up with one of the first stories, about the beans--beans noted throughout Italy, by the way, as the only ones never to cause indigestion. By the end, it was total super realism. That said, Rips is an entertaining writer who should stick to fiction that's billed as such."
1,Uhhhh...,"Okay, I give 1 star because giving the rythyms a phrase to say was helpfull. Unfortunetely the phrase she gave for the beledi (I-am-re-ady-for-my-massage) makes you play it wrong. Beledi is doom-doom teca-tek doom teca-tek, playing it her way is doom doom teca-tek doom tek tek. I guess she couldn't think up a cute enough phrase for it the right way. And she messed up so many times when she was doing the routines, I'm not even sure she's played the zills before. I would pass on this one, a good sub would be Zills with Ansuya from IAMED. Pricier but worth it, Ansuya would zill Dolphina into the ground ;)"
2,Celion CD,Super fast delivery and product was received was stated as seller. I would definitely buy again from this seller.
1,I can't believe you actually sell this!,20 minutes long if that. This is what you consider a documentary! Shot from a camcorder this is a true joke and amazingly you try to sell this as a documentary. The sound is horrible the interview is horrible and it looks as though I was watching a homemade (movie) in the silent era before film or video technology were discovered. A complete waste of money and time. Being a huge Ted Williams fan this would have turned him over in his grave! He would have never allowed you to put this out i can assure you. Take this off the market or Amazon needs to look at this. I will be reporting this to Amazon as well. An embarrassing joke to say the least!
2,A Great Running Shoe,"It's exactly what I was looking for, comfortable, stylish. . At the beginning I was a bit reluctant to buy a running shoe over the internet (I thought ... I must try it before I buy it!!) but I finally ordered this Adidas Megajet and guess what? I'm really happy with the result :)the best running shoe I've ever had"
1,Boring,I don't understand how this album has a better rating than Talkie Walkie. The songs on this album bored me death. Everyone seems to prefer this album over Air's other albums but I think Talkie Walkie is much better. I liked nearly every song on Talkie Walkie and I only liked a few moments on Moon Safari. Overrated.
1,Stretching for Seniors,"Very, very poor quality picture. Not relaxing to follow. Not what I expected or hoped for."
2,"It was STAR WARS, and that saved it.","One word, ""DULL"" and another, ""BLAH"". there best character was Anakin, and they sent him Jacen and Jaina to Anoth as soon as the danger started. it had high points, as all books do, I won't read this one again, but I am glad I read it, it'll give me something to put across from Zahn's books on my chart of Star Wars books. so you wanna' know why I read it all? It was suspenceful. Why did I give it four stars? It was Star Wars pure and simple."
1,I would never buy a product like this without a booklet,"Thank you R. Morris. I almost bought this product assuming it had and accompanying booklet in at least transliteration, but preferably script and transliteration. A language product without either?! Ridiculous! Thank you for letting me know before I wasted my money!"
2,"""The Dream Giver"" totally busts your borders","This I just an incredible video! I just happened on it in a video rental store of all places and now I just have to get my hands on a copy for myself! He puts things into perspective and really gets to the root of what keeps us from getting to the Dream that God has placed in our hearts. Watch the first two ""sessions"" on this and you'll want to watch the rest and start turning your dreams into realities!"
1,Definitely Cheaper on eBay,Go to eBay and spend about half the price for the equivalent cable NOT made by Sony. This way the bozos at Sony aren't making a dime off of you for their not-necessary-to-be proprietary cable and you still get what you need. I got this for my HDR-HC3 video camera for playback on my TV.
1,Oh no,"I can't believe what Kenny did to Julian Cannonball Adderley's hit. If he were alive today, Adderley would die twice. For that, Kenny should never be forgiven."
1,Better choices out there,"My daughter received this bouncer from an aunt. We tried sitting her in it a number of times, but she never liked it. It didn't look very comfortable for her, and the ""nature sounds"" were a bit annoying. We ended up putting it away--we should have taken it back to the store, but we waited too long. Although she didn't like this bouncer, she *loves* her Baby Papasan. Couldn't live without that one! Overall, the Eddie Bower bouncer just isn't worth the money."
1,Immune Power,"Dr. Kaiser's book presents information that has existed for many years prior to the onset of Human Immunodeficiency Virus. The book does a marginal job in reflecting information however, it lacks current research data to support his theoretical construct. The book does however, serve to provide a rudimentary understanding of pathologoical issues connected with the disease process. In my opinion, the book needs to be more centered on the psycholological issues that are as a direct result of multiple physiological problems associated with the disease process.In my opinon, readers should understand the author is a medical doctor and as such presents his information from a medical model and apparently lacks Clinical Psychological training in the field of Health Psychology to support his findings.David Wayne Doyle, II M.A.,LPC, CTADT,CCGCDoctoral Candidate-Clinical & Health Psychology"
2,No more sleepless nights from the neighbors,"If you have loud neighbors, roomate, or traffic; this sleep machine is perfect for you. In my apartment the ceilings do not have enough (or any?)insulation. We were constantly listening to TV at 2:30am. With this white noise, we no longer have sleepless nights.I highly recommend this sound maker if you are just interested in a steady white noise."
2,A good buy for Soundgarden fans. Not so much for non-fans.,"This is some good music. It is much more stripped-down than their later stuff, but the songwriting is still strong. The song quality is inconsistent, though. Very raw, it probably wont appeal to most people."
1,Cheap plastic and goes out of shape,Though it does the job.It is made of cheap plastic and goes out of shape quickly and bends easilyIt does not sit on any dinner plate properly
1,Out of box failure,This worked for all of 1/2 cycle of the ride. I would consider this a out of box failure. The manufacturer was no help at all but Amazon too great care to replace the item with a different one.
2,Captivating Business Story,"This book was required for my Operations Management class, and to be honest, I wasn't looking forward to having to read it. However, once I started it, I couldn't put it down. I finished it in about three days, which is hard to do when you're a full time student with 6 other classes to prepare for. I'd highly recommend this book for anyone in business or managerial positions of any profession. Enjoy!"
1,boring,"I hate to say it, but I was very disappointed in this series of books. You really can't review just one book you have to do all three. It was a good idea, but way to long winded. Very boring..... If you like Q ( which I do) you might want to read it to get some history on Q."
2,Fabulous read!,"Feminist? Yes. Hilarious? Most definitely! I enjoyed this book from ""cover to cover"" and couldn't put it down. Who wouldn't love a book where the women leave the men to make a BETTER society, lol. I was so thrilled by this book that I am going to have to look for more Sue Lange because I know I will enjoy any and all books by this author."
2,Outlaw Josy Wales,Having been a lover of Westerns all of my life I have found that if Hollywood would go back to the basic such as a good honest story line as in Outlaw Josey Wales where its good against evil the world might be a better place to live and the public wouldn't be pleged with the trash that's out there now.I'm thankful for Clint Eastwood he I think is the last hope in a America for film greatness. thanks pardner. Leo
1,WORSE THAN THE HOLOCAUST,"This is by far the most buggy, speed draining, useless garbage software ever written. Symantec has slowly morphed into a junk software vendor interested only in selling you useless gimmicky crap that breaks your computer. I am a computer technician and I see over 1,500 computers a year. Of the ones with this software installed, (perhaps 75 or more), NONE of them has functioned properly with this sloppy monstrosity on it. Symantec thinks since they own the trademark Norton, people will buy it's software because of it's once well-earned name recognition. And alas; they are right. The mindless masses eagerly shell over an exorbanent amount of money to adopt a little yellow box with the word NORTON on it, but beware - don't even get the BOX close to your computer. There should be a class action lawsuit against this crooked company. Anyone who gives this product good reviews either is in a persistent vegetative state or works for Symantec. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. Period."
1,Junk,"Cheaply made, the ""click"" action is vague and sloppy, and now it appears to be completely shot, and I only used it once. I would never trust this on any critical fasteners... could do a better job judging by hand.Should have put the 20 bucks towards a better quality item. My mistake."
1,"Ponderous, pedantic, and pretentious","It's not so much that this novel is both immoral and grotesque (which it is), but that the love that is supposed to bind it together is so preposterous as to make the novel unreadable. I found myself giving up around page 100, frustrated by the all-too-precious prose and the absurd idea of a man who's had his kidney removed by a woman only to fall in love with her. I don't know about you, but there's only so far I can stretch a metaphor. Take away my kidney, and that's where I draw the line.UPDATED: It was very interesting to see how all the bad reviews of this novel received multiple unhelpful votes while none of the good reviews did. I wonder who the voters are? Can you say author's friends and family?"
2,Looks good so far,"I haven't had the chance to shoot any caps in it yet (I was hoping to find some locally, but that may not be the case), but the gun itself seems pretty sturdy. The hammer doesn't cock back (I honestly can't remember if they did when I was a kid or not), but the cylinder does spin when the trigger is pulled. One thing to be aware of is that it does ship with an orange plastic piece on the end so you know it's fake (I honestly wanted something without an orange tip, but I'm pretty sure I can pull it off if I want). I'm using this with a Woody costume kit for Halloween and I think it'll work out just fine.My son loves the belt almost as much as he loves playing with the gun."
1,IT NOT WHAT YOU DO IT'S HOW YOU DO IT,I think that Mo'Nique has a problem with herself and trys to tell the world that she ok and its ok to be big. In my eyes its nothing wrong with being big or large but its how you carry yourself. You cannot walk around in life trying to make someone else feel bad to make yourself look good because when she gets home at night she probably cry herself to sleep. Now that being said if she wanted to make a point with Big Women or people in general she could should have to kept the point of how you can love yourself being big in a small world. Yes it is true that we live in a Barbie world and thin is in but in reality is not because I myself love dating big people but that does not mean that you have to put other down to make yourself feel good. This book has some good points but overall Mo'Nique needs to grow up and figure out what she loves about herself and STOP pointing the finger at everyone else(maybe thats why her husband left her).
2,Great,I love this sprinkler. I have a huge yard and would often get distracted and forget to move the sprinkler. Now I can set it and get other things done while it moves itself. Very Happy
1,Very short and small,Hard to read on 7 in kindle. Does not zoom. Just an intro. No story. Art work is good enough. Generic story line.
1,Antiquated Terms,"Our book club does not recommend WELCOME TO THE WORLD, BABY GIRL! mainly because of poor character development (lead character Dena especially) and what came across as a less than sincere development of what seems to be an anachronistic theme ( words like ""quadroon"" and even ""passing"" seem antiquated) or at least SHOULD be."
1,Completely Useless,This product is completely useless. I wanted to create some ringtones for my phone and it didn't work. It would let me download pics but not audio due to encoding or some other nonsense. I reccomend that you spend your money on a memory card instead. Then you can just drag and drop whatever files you want into your phone. it doesn't get easier than that.
1,Southern living,I was very upset because I didn't order it. It was to hard to return. Although I would have liked it otherwise.
2,THIS YEAR'S WINNER - HANDS DOWN!,"This is the book I most often recommend. Sister Souljah has woven an engaging and realistic story. I couldn't put it down. Though I read it months ago, I still carry vivid memories of the characters with me. They're so real that I occasionally find myself wondering how they're doing. I hope Sister is currently working on a new novel. Rest assured that I'll be among the first in line to purchase it.! RIGHT ON SISTER! Thanks for this gift."
1,Least impressive Banks' book I've read so far...,"While Ian Banks is one of the most interesting writers I've come across in the last few years, unfortunately ""A Song of Stone"" is one of the least engaging novels I've ever finished. Muted, yet overwrought, this tale of dissolution is less shocking than turgid. The extended and tedious stretches of ""purple prose"" in this disappointing book, which were apparently consciously intended to embody the self-absorbed and effete mental state of the protagonist and narrator, did little but lose my flagging interest repeatedly. Coyly lurid, and basically quite unsatisfying, this dim variation on an apocalyptic, Road Warrior-ish theme goes nowhere and then dies...Read anything else by Banks before or instead of ""A Song of Stone"". Though I do rather enthusiastically recommend Banks as an author, I can't in good conscience give thumbs up to this book."
2,*+*+*Mike & Shawnie*+*+* Major Transformer Collectors,"We are avid collectors of all things Transformer from G1 thru the new Cybertron series, and the line of Alternators is by far and away our favorite of all, Battle Ravage is one of the more top end Alternators in the series, with awesome attention to detail. We generally buy 2 of everything, one for our boys to play with and one for us to keep mint in the package for our collection, and Battle Ravage has survived their ravages of Autobot and Decepticon battles for Energon thus far. We are impressed!"
2,a little water for hours of entertainment,"I bought this for my 3-year old daughter, and it has become an instant hit. I am amazed with how long she is able to play with it. OK, it leaks a little and it's messy- but at least it's just water. In terms of a toy that keeps your little one entertained for hours, it's worthy of 5 stars!"
2,Great book overall,"This book is great for beginers as well as professionals. Easy to understand with plenty of illustrations and examples. The book covers form design, web page design, as well as business stationary design and more. I myself learned a lot from this book and would recommend this book to anyone wishing to know more about graphic design."
1,this game really blows,"this game is not very fun at all it has alot of reading and when you die you have to start all over again and you can not skip any of the reading and every time you have to fight something you go to this stage like thing then you take turns hitting each other it is really lame I don't know why the other reviewers say it is fun I would say this is the lamest mario game I have played and I have children age 16,15 14 ,12,10,and 7 that all thinks it is pretty lame also it really blows."
1,Not worth the money,My signal strength went from 86-88 to 87-89. Not worth the electricity it uses. And what is up with the RG59 cables? Anybody who is serious about signal quality will only use RG6. It is being sent back for a refund.
1,Vocals sink this one.,This is the most progressive recording by Marillion since Fish's departure. In spite of the considerable talents of the musicians within the band this recording suffers considerably due to the poor performance of Steve Hogarth the vocalist. When he restrains himself his vocals are listenable but seem out of place within the context of prog-rock. When he cuts loose he is in danger of sounding a fair bit like the Jon Bon Jovi's of the world. He over-emotes and leaves the music sounded as dated as an 80's era hair band. Marillion really need to consider a change in the vocalist's chair. Hogarth just doesn't cut it. Return to Fish era Marillion or turn to the Flower Kings or Transatlantic. Save your money and give this one a pass..Simon
2,"Cute, comfy dance shoes","I was afraid these would be too small as I ordered just one size larger than my street shoe and so many reviews said to go 1.5 or 2 sizes larger. I normally wear a 7.5 and ordered 8.5. The 8.5 is perfect, but it would be too big if I was wearing these in a real dance class. Please note that these are *dance* shoes. I am wearing them to Zumba class. I tried several other pairs of shoes and they were all too sticky. These allow me to twist and turn easily. I'm really happy with them, but I may go down half a size next time."
1,Very poor customer service!,"I accidently ordered the wrong item and when I tried to return the item I got absolutely no help and a lot of sarcasm. Long story short, the item is still sitting here."
1,DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED!,"I LOVED to read ""The Godfather"", therefore i believed that ""FOOLS DIE"" would be as excellent as, but it seems to be a tedious biography of Mario Puzo, who had to written something to get some money... mixed with something left from ""Godfather"" and a good draft text about human relationship who is used in the introduction and reprinted at the end to fill the gap left of the book."
2,Zaktan leader of the piraka,I got him one day at walmart and when I got home I built him.He has cool weapons like a 3 bladed sword and a zamor sphere launcher. I like everything about him except the rubber part it just doesn't seem right. Overall I give Zaktan a 9.8 out of 10.
1,The British Version Is Just As Bad As This One!,"I gave a review on the first season of the BBC edition a little while back and I mentioned how poor and boring it was. Yesterday I viewed the first episode of the American version of this farce and it was no better. If you people want to watch something entertaining & funny, then I suggest you watch ""Everybody Hates Chris"" and/or ""Scrubs."" Don't waste your time on The Office, from either Continent."
1,"Donnie Dacus, where have you gone?","This is that dead-dog Stills album that no one bought when it came out (for good reason) and they had a ""quad"" master laying around from the old SQ mixing. It really stinks. Its mostly Steve's newly discovered now washup/has-been Donnie Dacus. I am going off the LP; the CD must blow equally. As always, ""Your mileage may vary""."
1,not at all a good book about swami,I don't understand how a person who visits 3-4 monks & write about swami. He visited 2-3 places & wrote a big book. I don't think it's good book to understand about swamis & sadhana thay do.
1,Horrible little tent,"I spent one of the most miserable nights of my life in this tent. My daughter and I were camping on Current River and got caught in a strong rainstorm. The pitiful little excuse for a rainfly that this tent comes with is almost criminally negligent on Eureka's part. Any tent that doesn't offer a full-coverage rainfly is begging to leak.Woke up with darn near an inch of water in the tent with us. Wet bags, wet clothes, wet us.I hope to never have the misfortune of spending another night in a Eureka tent. At least not this one.I got home and ordered a Columbia Hawk Ridge tent instead. It's made all the difference. Much superior in every single way.I can't recommend this tent, unless you're planning on camping indoors."
2,Panic Free is excellent.,"I highly recommend ""Panic Free"" for anyone with anxiety. Dr. Freeman presents a unique perspective. This expert is different from other writers of books on panic and anxiety in that she has suffered from panic attacks herself. This provides ""Panic Free"" an insight into how to recover which is the best I have read. She is also very savvy about medications, and helps to clarify how to work with your doctor or psychiatrist, or how to work without one. The book is very informative, and gives clear steps to help get over the feeling of being trapped. Try this one, it actually works."
1,Both Sides are CRAZY!!!,"The question shouldn't be whether about Kerry as an officer in Vietnam. Neither you nor I were there, so let's get over it. And most importantly, great military commanders do not necessarily make for great presidents (U.S. Grant). The real questions should be 1) Did Kerry offer his service to this country? 2) Why did Bush and Cheney hide from serving in Vietnam? 3) Why is it so difficult for Bush to prove that he was not AWOL? I am not an die-hard Democrat, nor a Republican, but I do question the secrecy that this current administration hides behind."
1,Sub-standard product,"Although I received my order quickly the quality of the product was sub-standard. The image shows black tipped feathers, but the ones I received are a blotchy green. Several are in such poor condition that they are unusable. Several more are poorly trimmed or have notches torn out of them. Next time I'll pay extra and purchase feathers locally."
2,fun... but buggy,it has bugs. and glitches lots of them. it's like it was rushed to production. though it is still fun.
2,Classic trance upped the anté,"Greece 2000 is an anthem. Whether you've heard it or not, it is simply a work of trance art. Europa 2000 is no exception. Following the same lines as turkey and greece, Three drives cease to disappoint with a slow, suspensful build up, finally exploding into a vivid world of dancing imagery. This album includes all the 200's so far by three drives, so it is a goood value buy as well. If you ar eremotely into trance or even a seasoned veteran, I strongly urge you to check out this (on the downlow) quality cd."
2,A Good Shooter,"The Kyocera / Yashica T4 Zoom is a well-made, handsome and very compact zoom film camera. The lens has above-average sharpness and photos taken with this camera show little or no vignetting, a problem typical of these cameras. The camera is very easy to use and, although its small size makes for tiny controls, it's not hard to use. Color saturation is very good and contrast isn't bad, but photos may be overall a bit dark because of the slow lens speeds. My only complaint is that, at wide-angle settings, the flash isn't very powerful, but it's acceptable at close-up range. This camera probably won't take photos that are as sharp as those taken by a single focal length camera (like the Olympus Stylus Epic with an f2.8 lens -- sharper than the original T4? Maybe!), but for a zoom camera it produces quality results."
2,Stalking creepiness,"If you want to know what it is like to be stalked, order a copy of Evil Stalker by Violet Towe. The main character is stalked while investigating a series of gruesome murders actually linked to her being stalked.The reader will cringe at times as they follow the main character through her investigation.The darkness of the tale has a hopeful message, summed up nicely in the following author's words: ""....no matter how dark and lonely things get keep listening and before long you'll hear the birds start to sing their sunrise song.""Nice job, Violet Towe."
1,This is neither Suess nor Thomas,"This book has a picture of the Cat in the Hat in the corner of the cover. Don't let that fool you. The writing is awful. It sometimes rhymes, like a Dr. Suess book, but then sometimes it doesn't. There is sometimes a rhythm, but mostly it is lost and muddled. It is so poorly written that they don't even tell you who the author was (maybe it was done by committee?) Don't waste your money. Get a real Dr. Suess, or a Real Rev Awdry Thomas."
2,Deserves more respect,"I didn't really know what to expect while watching this movie. I heard that it was special effect driven, and no character building. I would have to say that I disagree with the no character building. I was really interested in hearing the backstory of the staff sargent. I really started to wonder if his group was goning to make it out alive. I just thought it was really entertaining. It reminds me of a video game like Resistance mixed with Gears of War. The thing I've learned over time is critics like bad movies, and hate good movie. They make us believe that The King's Speech or The English Patient are good movies. They tried to say that the first Batman movie that came out in 89' was bad. If I 'd listen to what critics thought I would have missed out on some really good movies. You just really have to judge a movie for yourself. You could always rent a movie befor you buy it. I would just have to say that this movie reminds me of Independence Day, which I thought was good."
1,Do NOT buy these sheets,"I bought four sets of these sheets in varying sizes and colors. I only give them one star because giving them ZERO stars was not an option. I was speechless when I opened the first set. The fitted sheet was so deformed that it wasn't even functional. It was bizarre, obviously not even good enough to be called ""irregular"" or ""seconds"". Thinking it was some sort of mistake, I opened the next set. Same thing. Avoid these like the plague."
1,Wrong all over,"It looks wonderful on the model, but not on me. The lace and seems were itchy, and it created a retro bullet bra silhouette, which if I had been looking for such would be okay. Normally I wear mostly t-shirts, and the occasional sweater. I like a much smoother look than this bra provides."
1,A Big Letdown!,"I was very disappointed in this movie. It did not live up to the hype. You do not get emotionally attached to the characters. It is just plain boring. Antz was by no means a good movie, but it was better than this. Do not waiste your money."
2,Quick and Easy Conversations,"This method leads to quick conversations. I am amazed at how easily I am learning the vocabulary and sentences. It is not uncommon for you to surprise yourself when the instructor asks you to say, ""Would you like something to eat?"" and you find yourself quickly saying the phrase. The Pimsleur method does not use visual learning at all, so that is one warning for those who may want to see something like a picture or phrase written out, but for me it has been a refreshing new way to learn a language."
2,Blindness,"Well written, but ""brutally"" realistic - the struggle of human ""good"" over human ""evil"" when society's security net no longer exists. Would ""good"" exist without vision in a blind society? One hopes it would, but the book makes you pause."
1,Bolts Too Short!,"Maybe it's because my crib is older? Anyway, we bought the crib in 2007 when my first was born. Finally bought the conversion kit in 2010 when we had our second. We didn't want to not have them in case the style was discontinued even though we knew we wouldn't need to convert for a few years. Tonight, I finally began switching out beds..2 y/o gets toddler bed, 5 y/o gets crib converted to full sized bed...and the bolts are an inch too short! Hopefully, I can get the same diameter bolt in an inch longer at Lowe's tomorrow. If not, the conversion kit will be useless to me!"
2,50th Anniversary frame,This is perfect for a 50th Anniversary gift! A definate must have.I included their before and after pictures as the frame was being presented. My inlaws loved it!
1,"Good Mouse, short life","Well the heading says it all I think. The mouse performed admirably with no problems for about nine months and then over the course of 8 hours it lost the ability to track movement. Literally,. I shut the computer down , went to bed for the night,. I woke up, turned on the PC and my mouse cursor was stationary. IT still registered clicks mind you.So I've currently had to go back to me previous 5-button which in a twist was an earlier model of this exact same device... maybe about 2 iteration cycles older, a mouse which had served me well for about 3 years and now continues to do so, with a few spasms of noncooperation here and there.I must say I am disappointed and I'd give this a flat out 1 or half star if it weren't for the fact that it worked well while it did and this might just be my bad luck."
2,Perfect for kayaking,"This wetsuit is excellent value, and I'm glad I purchased it. It gets pretty cold when I'm out in my kayak, but this wetsuit solved that problem. Fits great, perfect for kayaking, a great buy!"
1,Normally these shoes are good quality,"I have purchased many BCBG Katchen Shoes on line from Amazon. This is the 3rd pair of this shoe I have purchased in the last three years. I wear them as daily work shoe.Unfortunately, thie entire sole of this last pair came off within 3 weeks of wearing them. It was neither snowy or rainy. It was surprising as this shoe has always performed very well for me and BCBG is top quality. I wonder if Amazon had very old inventory in stock where the glue on the sole was separting.I was quite disappointed. But if you can get a normal quality pair, they are great. They look good and are very comfortable. I have never had an issue in the past and would still recommend them for women working in the office."
1,Disappointed,"For the most part the stories are extremely boring (let me hasten to add that i've been an avid Batman fan for the last 10 years), i only gave this book 2 stars because it had batman's name on it. the stories were childish bordering on moronic, not to mention out of date (1 story had bruce wayne ordering vacuum tubes for the bat computer). another flaw is that the book focuses more on bruce wayne than on his alter ego. for persons looking for good batman prose try the further adventures of the joker by the same editor or no mans land by gregg rucka."
1,Two thumbs down...,I didn't find anything in this movie uplifting. What is so uplifting about one man constantly judging another and letting all his anger out the whole time?A story of one man's trial to keep his church going in a bad neighborhood. Another man's test at learning what the other guy is living through.
2,Great book But . .,"Great book, read it when I was a teenager, about 40 years ago! However, I would not recommend reading the commentary first at the end of the book, by Herbert's son. It sort of ruined the book for me. If you're going to read it at all, wait until the end of the book."
2,I love the sheets!,I love to sleep on wonderfully soft sheets and these are definitely soft. The color is a beautiful golden tan. They fit the mattress great! You won't have a hard time putting them on like you can with some. Very happy with the purchase.
2,A Raunchy Comedy That's Surprisingly Sweet -- and Smart,"A raunchy but very funny and ultimately touching comedy. Much smarter than you would expect, and with a sweet center to it. It's not for the prudish -- there's some pretty frank sexual dialogue -- but it's all in good fun, and ultimately has a lot of pretty wise stuff to say about love, sex, relationships, and innocence.The performances are all great: Steve Carell tackles a really difficult role wonderfully, and as someone who had loved his work in ""The Daily Show"" for years, I was impressed at his acting ability here. And Catherine Keener is as wonderful as always -- funny and sweet and sexy, as Andy's love interest.Well worth viewing for the waxing scene alone!"
2,love buck howdy,"Always a great cowboy to listen to. Buck Howdy does it again. We love this cd. it is truly one of our favorites and stays in the cd player all the time. Thanks again Buck howdy, we look forward to seeing you live and your next cd!!!"
1,Unmarked package,"While I'm sure the cable is fine, it comes in an unmarked package. I didn't know I had bought it on Amazon, I didn't know it went with the printer I bought. It was beige not black like the picture. I tossed it!"
2,A Little Of Everything,"More than just recipes, this book also includes several sections writing about the region and it's relationship to cooking techniques. Also included are explanations of many ingredients, unique to Mediterranean cooking.The book is full of scenic Mediterranean pictures and pictures of the food as per recipe. And this is all done in an overall good balance, with respect to the actual recipes.A hard-core recipe book, it is not. But for someone new to this type of cooking, it is a great primer, that also gives you a little peak into this part of the world."
1,An Audio-lingual Textbook Posing as Communicative,"As an ESL teacher of six years and after studying the field of TESOL in graduate programs for 3 years, I have to say that this book is just another one to toss on the pile of ESL garbage materials. All the exercises are simple grammar substitution drills. The book attempts to cover too many forms in too few lessons. There are no explanations of grammar and no exploration opportunities to make such an inductive approach useful. Furthermore, I found the characters represented in the book to smack of stereotyping to the very point of racism. Do your students a favor and DO NOT adopt this book. If you must adopt it, make sure it's for the highschool audience it was written for and not for adult learners. I was forced to teach this book to adult learners for 5 years and even the very semi-literate beginners were not naive to the condescension involved in such a choice. I think the Northstar Series is much more communicative, and appropriate for adults."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DIGITAL EDITION.,"Awaiting feedback on really terrible formatting errors in the Kindle edition (as in, it's currently unreadable). Will update if anything changes."
2,unrisky buisness,"Most of the tracks on this cd are good. The only two that were not as good as the rest , were ""Guido the Killer Pimp"" and ""After the Fall"", though these were still pretty good. Most of the Tangerine Dream ones are hypnotic and dream like. Definately worth the purchase. I recently bought the film on blue ray so this is a good complement."
1,"Ughhhh, don't bother with GE Silicone II Sealant","I just spent this morning removing and troweling out the sealant I applied 3 days ago to an interior area. The sealant never cured! I touched it long after it should have hardened and it was still wet. Now, having removed the GE Sealant and washing it down, I need to go back to the hardware store and (gladly) buy a competing brand to apply. Not exactly what I needed during the Thanksgiving weekend holiday as I'll be climbing up and down the ladder since the product was used on interior windows in a bank of 3 floor to ceiling (14 ft highh) windows. Thankfully the windows are behind my sofa and no one walked back there during the holiday dinner. I just had not expected a product from GE to be so bad. Back to the Dap brand I go. For some reason I switched only this time. What a mistake!"
1,Repetitious Plot,"This was the first book by this author that I have read. I am not likely to read another. There were very erotic sex scenes, although the characters didn't really seem to connect emotionally. None of the characters seemed well developed and the story dragged and repeated itself a number of times.Perhaps books in this branch of the romance genre focus more on the erotic images rather than on a well written plot and interesting characters."
2,i prefer this to the clear adhesive.,"i originally tried out the clear adhesive first and wasn't too crazy about it. it was obvious and white when it dried. i tried this hoping it would be easier to blend in with my eyeliner and it is! it works great, it holds your fake eyelashes on for most of the day when applied right. i would recommend this product."
1,boring,you'd think dude was linked to the American Idol Chain for life with the over the top Production&the way He is presented with His vocals.nothing really stands out for me.His Albums thus far are just kinda there.he has talent but seems way to formula driven for a cat so fresh into there career.
2,"Great Insight, Easy Reading","I wish I had read this book while in college. This should be required reading of ALL University Students before a major is chosen.48 Days doesn't give you job ideas, it helps you analyze yourself to find where you truly want to go with your life. When you find your own personal strengths, you will be able to find the work that fits you best and helps you to be happy. This book is the written version of going to see a career councelor.I read this book in 3 days after receiving it, and wish that I had ordered it a month earlier, before signing a 1 year contract for a job I don't really like. Now I have a full year before I can implement the guidance given by Dan Miller and find work that I really love to do.We all know ourselves, but most of us don't take the time to truly analyze ourselves and develop goals. Read this book. Analyze your dreams and set realistic goals to achieve those dreams. Everyone CAN do it. Will you?"
1,this is the worst,First thing this is not real music it is some guy talking over a record. Thats why rap is not the highest form of music because you are taking someones melody and just talking over it. Wow isnt that great all you fools that buy this are sellouts.
1,Over hyped,"I just read this again after some 30 odd years. I didn't like it the first time and like it even less now. I have read all of the books by Heinlein and I feel this is his weakest one. Oddly, it is his most popular book with the masses. Less about SF than being preachy and trying to explore sexual mores. I remember this being controversial in the 70's, but it is not even shocking by todays standards. I think it is the frnak discussion of sexual attitudes that has kept this book popular for so many years. Highly recommend you don't read this until you have read the authors many other wonderful novels. Stranger in a strange land is the weak link in his long run of superb SF stories"
1,Not much fun,"Wii was Xmas present, so haven't used it long, but loved Wii Fit and Wii Sports. I did a bit of research and read that this one gets you up and moving. I assumed that meant like Wii Sports. WRONG. The controls are difficult to operate and there are no instructions. Have to choose your character (or Mii) for EVERY event. Then to suffer through the ""awards"" while hitting the A button to try to cut it short. Three adults played for 2 days, with newly purchased additional nunchucks and controllers ($$$!!) and realized...it's not us. Rent this game first. We should have."
1,Great book wrecked by runaway art directors,Beautiful pictures of everything including mouthwatering Italian cuisine no one will ever be able to make. Book is totally unreadable thanks to 4- and 6-point type throughout. Clearly the art directors have no respect whatsoever for the written word. Suggest they leave books to those who know how to read.
2,Cheap and Sharp,"I bought this knife thinking it would be just a cool knife to break out when I'm trying my hand in making some sushi, but I ended up using it everytime I'm cutting vegetables because of how sharp it is. The handle feels cheap, but it has held together nicely. The knife cuts through vegetables easy, and I haven't thought of anything to complain about it yet."
2,review by author C. Gale Perkins,"Carousel Music by Rick Moskovitz256 pages of suspense and heart rendering experiences of a young woman who spent several years in therapy to help her bulimia and borderline traits to relieve herself of the pain she endured during childhood and into adulthood. The author a practicing psychiatrist tells the story in a sensitive and thought provoking manner, which holds the interest of the reader to the very end. His sensitivity toward his clients is very vivid in the telling of his story. The courtroom scenes make you feel as though you are right there. I enjoyed this read from the very first page to the last. I read 242 pages in one day, I stopped 3 chapters before the end of the book as it was midnight! I was up at 6:30 the next morning to finish! I highly recommend this book."
2,Best Screen Cleaner,"This is , by far, the best screen cleaner out there! I have tried many cleaners, but this one cleaned the screen without streaking! It works great on laptops, desktops and even widescreens! You just can't go wrong!"
1,Rantings,"There is nothing new or original in the construction methods outlined in this book. The reader is simply shown how to construct a concrete house with large stone aggregate. The resulting product used as the example in this book is average at best. I am sure a structure built with this as an example would be sound but unless you like the look of concrete smeared rock, it leaves much to be desired. There is no real craftsmanship here.The author spends much time ranting at the current administration, national policy and organized religion that it becomes tedious and inappropriate. It is too bad that an author with obvious wit, would inject so much venom into a ""how to"" book as to make it unreadable.Lastly, the illustrations used are poor and of very little use. Equally and the photography is grainy and distant leaving much to be desired. With so many fine books available on stone masonry and slip form construction, do not waste your money on this."
2,Great bike tube,Previously I had purchases several bike tubes at Walmart and they didn't last very long. A bike rider recommended this brand and I'm pleased that I followed his recommendation. This tube is superior to other tubes purchased in the past.
2,Harry Potter's awesome,"Really awesome. JK Rowling is an amazing author and this is such a great book. I grew up with it, and it's still my favorite series. I'm 17."
2,Four stars,"This book was the first book on Wicca that I bought. Although I reccommend the book, I think it's not for beginners. Try Scott Cunningham."
1,Not user friendly,"I just returned my palm glove case. I tried it for a whole day. It is rather difficult to operate getting the palm pilot out of the case to use it while its on your belt. The velcro was way to difficult to deal with. The belt loop should be a belt clip, to take it on and off easier!This case was totally unhelpful for easy access. I hope to find a leather case with a belt clip on it."
2,Clean and fresh,I enjoy bathing with the product. It leaves no oily or dried feeling. It has a fresh clean feel and smell. I recommend it over other bath products.
1,Different Characters Same Soup Left Over,There's nothing different or imaginative about this movie. Basically If you see Fatal Attraction you have seen this movie. Except for minor details. Not even Beyonce and Ali Larter would have made this movie better.Save your money buy something else. Rent Fatal Attraction instead.
2,Great for arthritis,"This was a Christmas present for my granddaddy, who has arthritis and bursitis in his hands. The heat eases the ache and gives him a little comfort. Caution, Be VERY careful not to overheat or you'll get burned."
2,Wonderfully Simple,"These are very wonderful, multi-purpose items my wife and daughter use for face covers in the cold, dew rags, hair ties, neck warmers, sweat bands, etc. A great item for those, unlike myself, who have hair to control and those, very like myself, who tend to perspire a bit :)."
2,awesome imagery,"This book had some of the most novel ideas and though-provoking imagery I've seen in a while. Lots of really exciting ideas, ones that make you go, ""that's what i'm talking about."" Different stuff. Some were less well-written than others in this collection, but most were great. Wonder if this author has any other work."
2,Raise your thumbs!,I really liked this album. I watched the ballet and the music really fits. You should listen to this; it is a good CD in the classical area.A very moving piece of music!Enjoy!
1,surprised,"I read this book and this reader thought it was very poorly written and hard to read. It went in circles and at times I was wondering what I had read and would go back and read it over and over, and most of the time I never did figure it out. I was surprised I expected this to be a good and well written book."
1,Waste of Time and Money!!,"The head cleaner didn't work and fell apart. You are better off going to best buy and buying a head cleaner for $40, which is what I ended up doing."
2,Great Bocce Ball set!,"This is a gorgeous set of bocce balls, that's really all there is to it. Gorgeous and functional and great.It's really almost painful to start playing with them because you realize they'll never be quite as pristine again, but then you start playing and realize that the set not only looks great, but it plays very well too!Enjoy them!"
2,Opening books don't come much better than this one,"This is a dense but quite easy to read opening guide with very high quality. And the opening that it covers is one of the more interesting and versatile openings there is.The book strikes a good balance between analysis and verbal descrption. It is useful to any player, although I do recommend Matthew Sadler's Slav book for the <1800 player as the first introduction to this opening.The first black Slav game I played after studying this book was against a Grandmaster who is rated 400 Elo higher than myself. I equalised from the opening, and soon even reached an advantageous middle game (according to my own and Fritz' analysis). I attribute this to the quality of organisation of material in this book, which makes the lines and ideas easy to remember.BTW, I lost the game against the GM. That should tell you that middlegame study will improve your play much more than opening study."
2,story of many perspectives,Funny how Manhatten can become a small town. At least that's Lawrence Block's premise in writing this crime drama from several folks' perspectives - folks that don't really know each other but bump into each other often. The sexual tension with Susan is pretty extreme -- pretty much an X-rated read with explicit detail.
2,mesmerizing,"This album is simply amazing...I have been listening to it over and over again since I saw them perform here in Boston, and it gets better and better with each listening...do yourself a favor--buy this album AND be sure to see them in concert if you have a chance. Their concerts are flawless and beautiful."
2,BEWARE:,"Reviews of this very fine product that contain the words ""SHILL"",""SELL OUT"",""ESTABLISHMENT"",""HATE"" and particularly dismay at the prospect of (gasp) JOKES ABOUT THE FRENCH. The pathetic part is that such reviewers know that Miller's material and delivery are fantastic but because they disagree with his ""politics"" they dishonestly one star the DVD. He's stated that one of the reasons for his ""180 degree turnaround"" was that 9/11 changed him, and I'll buy that...if it was a deliberate career move and he means none of what he says now then he's easily one of the the most brilliant comics of all time. Even less reason for a low grade. Oh, and why is the concept of a conservative or right wing comedian battery acid in the eyes to so many people? How about an honest comedian?"
2,Really liked this DVD,"I have had some serious problems when learning to dance. With other dance DVDs, I would practically hurt myself in order to keep up with the fast-paced instructors. This was my first DVD with Shawn and Joanna and found that the basic steps were well-explained and it was enough to give me a good foundation on each dance. I also bought their ballroom starter kit and thought the selection of the dances that they taught was good and like the fact that I can learn more of each dance through other DVDs they have. If you want a quick way to sample and learn several types of dances without looking like a fool, you should try this one."
2,South Park Season 5,"Yet again, the amazing Trey Parker and Matt Stone give us another amazing season of South Park. This season has some of my favorite episodes; Super best friends - Jesus teams up with some of religions greatest names to destroy David Blaine. Scott Tenerman must die - one of the darkest episodes to date, and is referenced in future episodes (I'll make you eat your parents) of season five. Overall, a very storng season and a must have for fans of south park!"
1,Anyone For Pig On A Stick?,"I didn't like this book because of the gruesome behavior of Jack and the other boys on the island. They had been out of civilization for so long that killing a pig, or even each other, sounded like so much fun they couldn't resist it. I would give this book two thumbs down. Don't read it if you don't have to"
2,Almost what I needed,"I have an old HP L2005cu laptop. Still a great machine after upgrading to a bigger, faster hard drive. The dock works just great but only after I separately purchased an expansion 2 to expansion port 3 converter. Even HP documentation was unclear which type the quick dock was but the Amazon info lead me to believe it was a port 2 type. The converter was an extra $20 but the combo is just what I needed."
2,Husband is a foodie,What can I say Alton Brown is a great chef and a wonderful entertainer. All the little gadgits you never really need but really want even iof you don't know what they are for! Would buy every thing he has!g
2,A Classic Personal Narrative,"The author went on to have a long and noted career as an academic and government official. He was chief of the State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) and the Assistant Secretary of State during the Johnson administration.Roger Hilsman graduated from The US Military Academy in 1944 and was assigned to the OSS, Sent to Burma, the author commanded a guerrilla battalion, ambushing Japanese patrols, blowing up bridges, spying on the enemy, and slipping back into the teeming jungle. later he went to the prison camp in Manchuria where the Japanese had held his father and helped liberate him.This is an articulate and informative memoir. In the course of his career the author has written many political and policy books. This gives a sense of the man behind the job."
2,All You Will Ever Need,"The quality of picture and video is absolutely found here. You get so much Benny that you can't run out assuming you remember the good ole days when you laughed at the same skit month after month. Not packaged like the old TV show, these are presented in whole. Benny did do some skits more than once, but not even a complaint. I have also grown to appreciate the musical guests he had in the early years, real time capsule gems."
1,"Bough two, both broke within two weeks.","We purchases these fans for our kids rooms. My son's broke after two days, my daughters lasted I think ten days. My husband and I were the only ones touching them, so I can't blame it on the kids being rough. If it was only one I would understand, everything can't be perfect, but two that break that quickly make me think there is some shoddy workmanship."
2,Fits a King size down comforter!,"I really think that for the value price on this product it was worth it. I was able to fit my king sized down comforter that also had on it the duvet cover when i put it in the bag. It fit easily. The zipper is a little cheap so you must be careful when zipping up. Ad as other readers have said it is not water proof. But I think that if you are looking for something inexpensive, this product does its purpose."
1,Mr Gasket 12s pump = Low Rate Junk,"Lasts about six months....comes with a 90 day warranty. Hecho in china....go figure. Take your hard earned money and buy a solid, US made pump. It might cost twice as much, but if it lasts it is worth it."
2,The Diana Years,This is a beautiful tribute to Diana. Although Diana's years have ended she will be remembered for many years to come.
2,Great info!,Recently had a trip to Egypt just before the turmoil and this series did a great deal to suppliment my trip. Well done.
1,Lies,"Folly- A book of unreal comfort for those inside a world of uncomfort. Jesus this, Jesus that. Read the Bible instead."
2,Elegant timepiece for everyday wear,"I chose the Skagen brand for its generous warranty and timeless design. I was also partial to the titanium mesh band, which are quite comfortable and light, unlike hefty links, which sometimes pinch my skin or hair. The mesh is quite durable, unlike many leather bands. The demi mesh 382SGSD is elegant in its simplicity and is perfect for everyday use. The dual-tone metal ensures it will not clash with jewelry. As a woman with petite wrists, I appreciate how easy it is to adjust the Skagen mesh wristbands; this may be done at home. Additionally, the slender design of this watch's casing is very feminine and understated. I would highly recommend this watch to any woman looking for a simple, yet elegant watch. It's been nearly 6 years since I first purchased this watch, and have had no problems whatsoever."
2,Yummy Pops Rock!,"I bought these to give out to trick-or-treaters, but had to do a little quality control before handing them out. :) They taste great! My 10 year old and husband and neighbors agree. We had almost 2,000 trick-or-treaters (no, that's not a typo) and it made me feel good to give them healthy candy! Will definitely order again."
1,"Feature packed, but...","This phone offers great features and is easy to use, but the battery life is terrible. I am on my second phone and plan on returning it to exchange it for another brand. Had a problem with the battery coming loose in the handset which causes the phone to think a fully charged battery needs recharging after 20 minutes of use. Manufacturer offered a solution, but did not solve the problem."
2,Wow this is better than expected!,"At this price I expected cheap plastic, but it even feels well made. The screen is crisp and bright even in daylight. The kids love it. The dealer who installed it couldn't believe how little I paid for this!"
2,SCUM-the title of a generation,"the album that stared the heaviest music genre ever-GRIND!!! this album is an album that started grind.simple as that.pure brilliance.crashing drums at a mile a minute, homicidal chainsaw guitar that WILL tear off the heads of the light hearted, a low end bass that keeps the backround steady, and the vocals that created a new form of singing.,. napalm death came out with an underground heavy metal CD later labeled by all as the begining of a driving, powerful, brutal force known to many as grind."
1,Worst movie of the years,"This was one of the most unfunny movies of the year. I bought the movie because of Natalie Portman and James Franco and because I also love spoofs on the whole genre like Mel Brooks ""Robin Hood, Men in Tights."" But this movie is just bad, boring, gross and unfunny."
1,expired,"Expired more than 2 years ago awesome, never buying this again thats for sure going to see if i can get a different bottle."
2,works well enough with a Canon Pixma photo printer,"The only problem is that Windows (Windows 7 64bit) usually believes that the printer timed out... at least until the picture prints. Considering that there are so few choices for small appliance network print servers, it's good enough.I didn't use any of the software they provided to set it up and had no real problems."
1,Disappointing,This book offered a great deal of information that was intellectually interesting. For the new Mom looking for a way to incorporate yoga into her life with a new baby it this is not the book.
2,Another Gem from Dwight,"This may be one of the shortest discs we've gotten from Dwight, but the music is top notch all the way. I am very excited about this release and find it much more satisfying that his last two albums combined. I look at music this way. I had much rather have quality music than a long disc that you're ready to throw away half way through.In this day and age when country has become watered down pop it is refreshing to hear an artist stick with his roots and that's what you get here. Pure unadulterated, Dwight Yoakam."
2,Finally!!!!!,"Finally a cookbook that can be used! I get this book for anyone I know who is starting out or who needs to learn how to cook. I use mine constantly, and find that the results are always as stated- people rave about my cookies, brownies...all staight out of the book. Buy this and you will never need another general purpose cookbook or technique reference."
1,Disappointing,"I've been a fan of this series for years and until Book V, they seemed to be getting better and better. Book V was decent, but somehow not on par with the rest of the series. Mediocre is the best word to describe it. Book VI (The Song of Susannah) is just plain bad. The biggest problem is that it is very short compared to the others (except book I). The decision to write himself into the series has really mucked everything up, but it might have been smoothed over with an additional 400 pages of text. This book feels rushed and disorganized. There are several plot points that seem be going in several different directions and serve only to distract the reader. While the plot content of this book is disappointing, my biggest disappointment is that this book takes place mostly in New York and Maine. That takes alot of the magic out of the story. I enjoy the series mainly because it focuses on other worlds. I haven't lost faith for Book VII yet, but I'm definitely worried at this point."
2,Surprisingly good,"All the way through this book, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.On the whole, I think the book could have been stronger. We never really got to see the early parts of the marriage which was supposedly so great. Stephen's descent into madness was a little unbelievable, and the ending was too contrived.HOWEVER. It held my attention, and I liked it in spite of its flaws. I think this is because the main character was believable, and her transformation was also believable.On the whole, excellent mind candy, recommended for a lazy afternoon or a long plane trip."
1,Not much joy in Joyva,"The cost per ounce was extreme, the bar was dry, stale, old tasting. I wouldn't purchase from this company again."
2,Missed the original concert by one day,"Missed the original concert by one day, but was so glad that I could watch it all the years later and see what I missed"
1,This is crap,"First of all, the cover photo is of the CGC Taney in '73 - '74. Hall was long gone by then. In addition he's supposed to be a radioman and doesn't even know the ship's call sign is NRDT. Give me a break. Don't waste your time."
2,Rapidfire entrepreneurship,The bad reviewers are right about lack of depth and writing ability. Read this book if you want to read a page and a half about how a bunch of well known businesses were started.
1,Meh,"Funny at times because it's Seth MacFarlane's writing, however, some of the scenes were just plain awkward to see acted out..."
2,Great headphones!,"I bought these headphones because I have Tinnitus and have trouble hearing the TV at low levels. Wouldn't you guess that my wife has above average hearing and prefers everything at low levels. So I got these awsome headphones for our bedroom, when we watch tv late at night. They are incredible. They are crystal clear and have great sound. I don't know why I waited so long. I'm planning on buying another pair for my living room. My experience with Amazon was, as always, easy and I got a great price. I am very satisfied."
1,"Great Band, Disappointing Album","I am a Starsailor fan and was completely riveted by their first album, the stunning vocals, the song-writing, the depth and diversity of subject matter and musical approaches made for a full, satisying album. Sadly, that's not the case here. While the vocals are as compelling as ever, the songs are, save two or three songs, much weaker, redundant, anemic, cliche-laden, forgettable. If you love Starsailor, then you will, as I did, buy this album, but it is clearly a mediocre shack compared to the splendid skyscraper of the first album."
2,Great reference for any mother who is breastfeeding,"I purchased this book for my sister in law who recently had her first child. In my opinion, it is a terrific reference book. Whenever I'd have a question or concern, I'd look it up. I have recommended it to many people over the last 10 years (since the birth of my first child)."
2,"Very Quiet Filter, at last!","I bought this filter to replace two Marineland Emperor 400 hob filters on my 75 gallon community tank. I have only had it set up for a month but I am amazed at how quiet it is! I read reviews that stated the plastic clips broke easily or that it was difficult to assemble. It did take longer to assemble than I expected, but unless you have a faulty product or are trying to force pieces together that aren't meant to go together the fittings shouldn't break.Admittedly I have only had it set up for a month but I am very happy with this filter. My water looks fantastic, my fish are happy and my living room is much quieter than it was with the two hob filters."
2,BRILLIANT MUSICIANSHIP!,"STELLAR PERFORMANCES, YOU JUST DON'T FIND MANY GUYS (or gals) THAT CAN PLAY LIKE THIS..!!"
1,It's dead already... less than 30 days...,"Going to check into returning/exchanging it. Of course, I don't have the box either <sigh>... Worked fine - when it worked. Now, no lights, no nothing. Something in power supply died."
1,Not ewerything is good on DVD,"This is not a DVD with quality. The Concert from 1975, but quality far from that. I recommend to turn down the sound look at the TV-picture. Turn on the audio CD of ""The Journey..."" in orginal. That's help!I'm Sorry! I'm not supriced!"
1,non-washable plastic transfer,"This basically glues a plastic sheet to your shirt with your design printed on the plastic. Wearing it feels like you might imagine it would, and it doesn't survive washing very well, even if you wash it by hand very gently. The directions tell you to iron it for much longer than it can handle. If you do as you're told, you'll burn it."
2,"Kinda different from their last album, but still good.","I'm not really into this whole metal scene. i coulnt' tell the difference between death, doom or power metal. I like old punk but this band caught my attension. Tho it is different from their last album, the female vocals is what makes me wanna come back. no other band has that pure voice of depression. tho the lyrics could be better, I still think its worth a listen. the synth doesn't really come thru on this album, they have more emphisis on guitar. better than any other band out there, I will say that."
2,Great for many uses,his thing looks great and is warm but not hot. It's much easier to breathe through than a ski mask. Ive worn it in movies and in the winter months here in Indiana where it is necessary. I honestly can't find anything to complain about on this.
1,So bad I can't finish it!,"I've picked this book up at least 3 times to try and finish it and it is just so BORING I have to keep putting it down. A good story makes you want to keep reading it and maybe even finishing it as soon as you can. This story is just not well told. It drags on a bit and the characters aren't hero material. Same goes for her other book, ""When in Rome"". I picked these due to the funny caricatures on the cover and the storyline sounded like it was going to be a fun read. Not so! I cannot recommend this book. Try the Sophie Kinsella books for good Brit Chic Lit."
1,Not Durable,"I purchased the Med/Large version rated for strong chewers according to the product label. It lasted all of 4 hours with my 55lbs Hound. The rubber is much too soft for strong chewers- esp. in comparison to The Chuckle, made by the same company, or Kong branded rubber toys, which have held up just fine with my dog. Save your money and get a different product that will last."
2,Bet On This...,"""Casino"" tells the tale of Las Vegas run by the mob through the decades. Sam Rothenstein (DeNiro) is the casino manager and Nicky Santoro (Pesci) is the hot-headed criminal who brings heat into the land of slot machines and dice. Sharon Stone also heats things up big time in her mini skirts and jewels as she plays Sam's sultry wife, who has an affair with Nicky and throws everything into complete turmoil. ""GoodFellas"" stars join the cast here, for this three hour plus film filled with blood, love, lust and excitement. Never a dull moment. Scorsese once again does the job with great directing. See it. It stays with you."
1,Does a disservice to the pagan community,"Bonewits's treatise on magick is good enough as an introduction to magickal practice, but falls flat on its face on the whys of magick. Most of his explanation of the ""science behind magick"" is pseudoscience, much of it already thoroughly debunked, especially now that the Russian science community is no longer under Soviet control. His explanations of auras and telepathy are particularly disappointing; if it is true that they involve radio waves, they should have been measured under controlled conditions, and they haven't been. His 'color categories' of magick only cloud discussion. Read this book with a great deal of skepticism. Then move on to Liber Null or Magick in Theory and Practise."
2,A LONG terrific book,"One of the best books I've read lately -- satisfyingly long and so beautifully written you don't want it to end, despite the suffering you endure along with the Lewis & Clark Expedition it depicts. You really feel like a member of the Clark family of Virginia, and a part of the expansion of America."
1,Sounds like a fake to me,500-1000 shots for an authentic Canon battery is not good which leads me to believe this is a fake. My Canon battery that came with my 20D would get me at least 1200-1500 shots at a wedding even after using it for 6 years and still have power left over. Unfortunately another photographer whom I was working an event at in Schaumburg stole mine while I had it charging and stuck his cheap knock off battery in my charger. Protect your authentic Canon batteries because they are worth every penny!
1,Taste Fine.,Taste fine but just a pain to fill over and over. I am doing this just for me and my dog so if you have a family this is not the way for you to go.
2,daylight agian,this is sweet. had it on tape and worn it out an long time ago. never could find it agian until amazon.. thank you. laurie
1,Anything to make a buck..,"I can only assume that this is meant to be a joke. From the samplings, it seems that not only the quality suffers, but no one can match axl's tone or slash's masterful licks.. This should definitely be considered a poor excuse for a tribute, but more importantly a failure as a compilation of music."
1,smells and feels good,I used this and the cream just to make sure I was not getting stretch marks. I used it every night every morning. last month....got stretch marks. didn't work for me :(
1,"Without Marvin, not worth it...","I've been waiting for this title to become available on dvd because it's been impossible to find on VHS. SAVE YOUR MONEY. They seem to have dumped the original soundtrack. It's not there. The movie opens with Marvin Gaye's wonderful voice drowned out by someone else singing over him. That was it for me. What made the film exceptional for the time period was Marvin Gaye's masterful soundtrack. I couldn't believe what had been done. Truly disappointing. If you don't mind this oversight, you'll love this dvd. If you're looking for the original soundtrack to this film, save your money."
2,RICO'S VIEW,Another very nice Dewalt product. I wanted a strong sturdy and flexible tool bag for my Dewalt tools and this bag works great. Plenty of room and nice small item pockets to use. Appears to be very well made!
2,Eaten Alive ! its realy unnature Video,"It would be a lie to say that we've never seen a film quite as bad as Eaten Alive, but after watching Tobe Hooper's ""follow up"" film to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it sure feels like the worst thing we've ever seen. Quite frankly, we feel as though we were eaten alive... by boredom.As in Chainsaw, the main action here involves hapless passers-by and their summary slaughter by a raving lunatic. Unfortunately, the power-tool wielding family of cannibals from the earlier, superior film has been reduced to a lone innkeeper with a ridiculously out-of-place crocodile and a large gardening implement.But let's not get ahead of ourselves.We knew we were in trouble when the film's opening shot of a full moon dissolved into the sun-shaped belt buckle of a hillbilly. This isn't just any hillbilly though, this is Robert Englund in the pre-Nightmare on Elm Street role of Buck..."
2,Funniest movie this year!!!,"When I first saw Eurotrip, I just couldn't stop laughing. It was so hilarious. And now, after seeing it about a dozen times, the effect is still the same. I mean, the jokes in this movie are just so great.And also the characters are great. Every single one of them. I mean predictable Scotty, my retarded friend Cooper, the nerd Jamie, cute Jenny, beautiful Fiona and all the way to the funny soccer hooligans. Maybe some people were feeling insulted after seeing it (the scene with the little 'Hitler' boy, the scene in Bratislava,...), but the movie is still great. It just shows the American stereotypes about European people (like the [...] guy from Italy,...) and it also shows how American people don't know nothing about the rest of the world (Europe is NOT a country).But all this facts, in the end, make a movie so great. So if you are lookin a movie, which will really make you laugh, i definitely recommend you Eurotrip."
2,Extremely Practical Advise for All,"This is a fine book that frankly should be mandatory reading for all. The title gives the impression that the book is aimed at priests. It's actually a series of lectures/essays on the virtues give to seminarians. The advice given is rock solid, practical, and inspiring. It is applicable to all: young, old, men, women, atheists, priests. While firmly rooted in Catholicism, the practicality of the Golden Rule doesn't discriminate based on creed.One of the reviewers took the book to task for lacking scriptural quotes. I don't think he read the book carefully. Each chapter includes a scriptural notation in the header, and the text itself is peppered throughout with scriptural notations. The serious reader will have his Bible at hand to follow up on the cites."
2,Vintage Isaac Hayes with some (good) new wrinkles,"""Raw and Refined,"" is a very good CD. Although almost all instrumental, it still serves up a nice combo of soul, smooth jazz, funk and instrumental, starting out with the rousing soulful rock anthem ""Birth of Shaft,"" continuing with a fusion of funk and smooth jazz in ""Urban Nights."" ""Funkalicious,"" ""Soul Fiddle,"" and ""Funky Junky"" also offer up a fun cross of funk, jazz, with a touch of soul that you'll want to listen to over and over. Two of the last three songs ""Southern Breeze"" and especially ""405"" are outstanding instrumentals that alone warrant buying the CD. Isaac Hayes stays true to his roots, but does a great job of blending in other styles that should please both his longtime fans and smooth jazz fans who don't mind in little funk in their latees. Excellent ""road trip"" CD."
1,Waste of money and time,There is only 2 tutorials and this information is available from After Effect. This young boy displays everything he doesn't know about AE. There are many places to find great tutorials for AE and this is not one of them. Chris and Trish Meyer have in depth books out with footage that are great. Total Traing is another good resource for AE training. Save your money and don't buy this junk.
2,A Fresh Perspective On Biblical Tales,"My younger son suggested that I read Alloway's book. My son's literay tastes run to Robertson Davies and other highly literate authors, so I took his comments as being quite positive. And, he was right.Alloway has taken the skeleton of little known and oft neglected biblical stories and overlaid a richness of detail and dialogue to illuminate the rawness of life in the crucible of experience of early modern humanity's struggle to reconcile the inner world with the harshness of the social environment, itself a reflection of harshness of the physical environment.This is a book for those willing to travel beyond the superficial to the highly personal, intimate effort that every person must make to encounter the reality and meaning of his or her existence and reason for existence. It is a book for the robust explorer of spirituality in the world of pain and wonder and searching and confusion and insight."
1,Revising preveious opinion,At first I was disappointed by this DVD. Seemed like a rehash of previous DVD's. And it is. But they are cleverly clipped and spliced to make over 50 different workouts and like 8 different training tracks. I must say I've warmed up to this DVD now I quite enjoy it.
2,John Boos cutting board very durable,"The John Boos Chop-N-Slice cutting board is a very good board that exceeded my expectations. Over the holidays, my in-laws were staying with us and did most of the cooking. I was worried that my brand new board would not survive the abuse because of the way they cleaned and used it. Normally, I would clean the board with a wet soapy towel and immediately rinse and dry. My in-laws on-the-other-hand would wash it in the sink with copious amounts of running hot water and lots of soap and let it air on the dish rack. The cutting board held well despite this repetitive cleaning, and I didn't notice any warping or splitting which I noticed on my previous wooden cutting boards. I did see some splintering on the corners which is expected since this board's edges are not rounded."
1,Disappointing,I bought the book. Luckily I bought used. The binding broke not long after I bought it (without much use). I had to wade through the book. It has some good pearls if you can last that long.
1,"Without their DJ Tony Byroads, Crossfade reduced itself to a generic band...","Listening to this album had me almost convinced I was listening to 3 doors down, Papa Roach or even Dark New Day. But no, the album cover certified me that it was in deed Crossfade I was listening to...Tony Byroads added a unique sound to the band and without him, the band has lost their novelty. Too bad.It might still appeal to your ears if you just want an album that rocks, although you could probably get that from any other generic band. If you were looking for that particular sound produced in their first album, then you might be out of luck."
2,Willy Caslon Experience,Must have mix for any DJ or any true fan of good electronica. Lots of original rhythms and beats. Check out the two tracks by the Willy Caslon Experience
1,"Spore, the most anticipated game ever to bore me.","I wanted to love this game, really, I did. But I can't. It is so repetitive... stupid games of Simon Says over and over again to impress creatures, oh look these guys want me to play a flute... again, dumb. Then you get to the massive space phase with the WORST gaming controls I have ever seen. Flying the space craft is the most bass ackwards thing I have ever seen in a video game. This game was not worth my money. I am sad I bought it."
2,for very small children,"This book is great for very small children that still have to be read to, under school age, older kids with pads and computer like devices will not appreciate it,bmj"
2,HEAVY FUEL ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm thinking this is the best Dire Straits CD yet. And I hear people whining about this album, can they stop whining and startliking this music? This album was the last Dire Straits studioalbum, and this one ROCKS! This one has several really great songs. One of my favorite songs of all time appear on this album,Heavy Fuel, probably the greatest song of all time. The live versions just as great. Is incredible. Highly recommended.Buy this great album today with Love Over Gold, and Making Movies. They are just as rocking as this one."
2,Mel Scores again.,"Great movie, the speaking of the mayan dialect doesnt detract from this movie at all.Mel may be a drunk, jew bashing sob. But man can he make a movie. I went into this movie thinking I wouldnt like it but was throughly suprised by it. Its a true classic.If you liked his previous work and your looking for a movie with a southamerican motif you cant go wrong,Also I didnt think this movie was as gory as everyone proclaimed it to be."
2,"Gee, it sure is large.",I put this massive poster on the wall in front of the desk where I studied for the Java 2 Certification. It helped. It would be nice if it had been designed for smaller space.
1,Junk,I'm so upset w/ this product! Started great but terrible corosion after about 6 months and useless! I wish I could return this product but it's too late. In the future I will just get wood products for my child's kitchen. It allows them to be more creative anyway.
1,Don't Buy This Book!,"Don't buy this book! If you're seriously looking at being able to find out about all of the registry line items available in Windows 2000 this isn't the book. The book is rated intermidiate to advanced. What?!?! It's a beginners book. I expect a book that is advertised at such levels to be like ""Windows NT 4.0 Registery: A Professional Reference"". Now that's a registry book!"
2,Cinderella With An Attitude!,"Violets in the Snow is the funniest, sexiest take on the Cinderella story written. Isabelle is beautiful, pious and charming. John is, according to Isabelle, ""no prince."" How they get together is pure fun. And it doesn't hurt to have a guardian angel close by. John and Isabelle weave a tale of what happens between the wedding and the happily ever after."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen.,"It seems like a lot of people think that if something is different then it must be good. While different often is good, this movie's a great example of that not always being the case. You shouldn't have to watch a movie more than once to understand it. For those saying, you have to see it again to appreciate it. No thanks. I wasted enough time the first time. I only wish there were a way to rate this movie a zero or at least a half star."
2,Rules of Engagement: The Art of Strategic Prayer and Spiritual Warfare,"To God be the Glory! This is an awesome work of the Holy Spirit. This is not only my daily family prayer but I am now taking it into my ministry. We as a body will read this EVERY week until ALL are healed and delivered. I believe it will bring order, healing, restoration, and abundance. I strongly reccommend this book if only for the prayer! God has an instrument and a general for the army of intercessors in Cindy Trimm. God Bless her obedience."
2,SLEEPER,"Although the blurb on the DVD's back cover indicates that this movie is ""Science Fiction"", it is not, except perhaps in the broadest sense, since it is fiction about science, instead. Events in the movie appear at first to move slowly, but not if you pay close attention to the little details. The ending throws a curve ball that is quite satisfying. This film won numerous awards at independent film conclaves. It deserved them all, although its appeal is mostly cerebral. Don't expect any special effects, it is not that sort of movie. It is, however, a profound movie about a rarely addressed aspect of human affairs. It might be called existential. It has greatness in it. It also requires some engagement in the story by the viewer. Unlike the in-your-face fantasy that currently pervades Hollywood (""Transformers"", the ""Terminator"", movies and such) this movie requires a bit of thought. It is well worth that effort."
2,Great Flick,What's there to say..really the AVENGERS. Great Movie. nice to be able to watch it on all my devices at anytime anywhere!
2,"Fantastic collectible item, of one of the greatest stoner bands of all times.","Clutch firmly implanted themselves as one of the most talented hard rock bands making music today. Burning Beard CD music With wildly creative songs that are both memorable and powerful, here comes a goodie for the true fan and fan to be: Burning Beard - one of the most powerful songs of the album in a limited edition with bonus track ""Slow Hole to China"" on the Vinyl version and the Burning Beard video on the CD single. 2006."
2,Awesome movie,Outstanding DVD. All the actors give superior performances. Very well directed and filmed the story line is riviting and keeps a fast pace.This is a must own for any collector who enjoys a strong plot and great acting.
1,Disappointed,"I had very high hopes for this book. I forced myself to finish it after reading the first chapter. Imagine a book written by an artist trying to describe the same mountain a scientist is trying to describe. The artist would write things such as vibrant flora, majestic soaring peaks, and serene tranquility. The scientist would describe it as: Mount Everest. Elevation: 8,848 meters above sea level. Located in the Himalaya Mountain range in Tibet. It is two people describing the same mountain from very different perspectives. This book is like an artist is trying to describe and explain Mount Everest to the world. Anybody looking for a more logical perspective should pass.It is probably a good read if you're an artist trying to explain yourself to the world. It is probably not a good read if you're a scientist trying to explain yourself to you. I know that's a sweeping generalization, but that's the basic premise of this book. An individual loner versus a sweepingly generalized mob."
2,Outstanding,"I got the movie quickly with no scratches and in wrapping. It was like buying it from a store. Not sure that there is a better way to get this movie, but I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
1,Broken Glass,"I ordered this item and apparently the claw was too heavy since witin a couple of days of displaying it the claw fellFitz and Floyd Glass Menagerie Craboff. I notified amazon and a new crab was shipped. However, when I opened the box a leg was already broken off apparently during shipping. This item appears to be too fragile to ship."
2,Fun work title,"I have used this book and the fun, whimsical discussion of personality/ style differences in a number of locations. It makes it easy to talk about a subject that can make some people uncomfortable. We are all different, and this is actually a good thing - any organization needs people with complementary skills. If we were all alike, it would get really boring, really fast."
2,HTML,This is my roommate's and he is really enjoying it. Said he can finally understand it. It is a subject that can be very confusing.
1,Tedious & Stock,"All of the negative reviews you have read here are true. As a 26 year Rush fan, I was dying to get this, and then was grateful I bought it with a gift card. I've read numerous Popoff interviews over the years, and I expected much more. As for the band, they seem as bored interviewing for this book as I was reading it!"
2,Great literature source for teaching a Native American unit,"This book provides rich detail about the life and experiences of a Native American girl named Karana. The reader is provided with a vivid picture of her everyday life, culture, and adaptations she made to meet the challenges she encountered.Educators can use this book to create a wide variety of activities. There are several interactive online resources available to help teachers enhance their lessons."
2,Very Exceptional Author and Book,"Ok Now to undersatnd the concept of the Man Alex Cross you would have to read Along Came The Spider and Kiss the Girls. Alex Cross is an Emotional yet tuff Detective/Pyschiatrists. He is the best in his feild. The two mureders are Jack &Jill the murders killing Popular Celebrities In washington. And there is the Truth School Murders. A Sick Twisted Homicidal Maniac is Killing little Children that Attend Sojurner Truth Elementary School. Both of these very detailed characters are greatly written. they delve deep into there mind without surronding the novel onto them. The novel is not the most brilliant peice of Marksminship he has writtin but it is very suitable and ELECTFYING, It kept me turning the page after every single chapter until i knew i was done with the book. It is a Chilling and GRIPPING NOVEl. If you are not careful the book will eat you up alive."
2,QuckBooks 2006 is easier than ever to use,"The 2006 version of QuickBooks is even better than prior years editions. It is much easier to use and learn. It helps non-accountants do bookkeeping and business management functions easily and correctly.There are big improvements in the 2006 version, such as expanded MS Office import/export features, a new homepage for users that makes it easy for them to understand what steps to do next in their daily work, and an easy, quick set up interview.I think every small business owner should try out the 2006 QuickBooks - either Pro or Premier, or the 5 pack if you have multiple users."
1,uhoh,"Im not certain what mr. martin was thinking, book 3 was a real page turner but ""A feast of crows"" tends to go off the story as a whole and disappointed me."
1,"good devotional, need not update","I have used this devotional for years, and wear them out or give to someone who is hurting and seeking.I was very disappointed with the update and the small print. If something is great you don't change it. I believe in keeping print at a readable size. print very small.I would not recommend any one to buy it."
2,No Pilot,"The DVD collection is great EXCEPT it does not include the Pilot episode. I can't believe that it is not included. So if you expecting the whole first season forget it, the first season does not include the pilot!"
2,Works well,This filter seems to be working well. Filters the water in the tank and has significantly reduced frequency of water changes.
2,Liz liked this item,"Bought this for my neice. She says they are great. Let's her organize all her disks and keep them clean. Not too expensive, and they work"
1,If I could choose less than 1 star I would,"System of a Down is the worst band that has ever existed, currently exists or will ever exist in the history of the world. How a no-talent collection of alt-metal posers can get a music contract is incomprehensible."
1,Take a pass...Nothing new here.,Repetitious. Long-winded. Over-hyped. Over-rated. Disappointing. Read the first 5 pages in book store and redeploy your capital elsewhere.
2,Another 5 Stars for Apple,"Within 5 minutes from out of the box, I had this out and working. Range is great, and it was very easy to set up the security. Couldn't be a better product, does exactly what it is advertised for, and the 5 different sets of settings make it a truely mobile wireless base station, haven't seen a better one yet. I have used both Lynksys and D-Link and they do not come close to ease of use and quality."
2,Nice and friendly humidifier,"Nice, friendly and functional. I like it a lot and I use it often.Delivered on time and in the described condition."
2,Wonderful for making dough!,"I actually didn't purchase this bread machine, I received mine for free through a Freecycle group. So obviously, my model came to me used and was actually a bit banged up. It's lid is no longer attached, and it looked like it spent some time on the counter being ignored. But it works and that was key. But let me tell you about how it performs and how I use mine.I don't like the way the bread baked in a bread machine comes out so I only use it to make dough (or butter if I'm feeling fancy). I use mine several times a week. It's getting a ton of use out and considering I've had it for about a year and a half, it's doing a bang up job.Will I buy another bread machine? Probably not since it takes a ton of space up on my extremely limited counter space and I can probably do exactly the same thing with a mixer which I can then use for other cooking projects. But if I were going to purchase a bread machine, I'd get another one of these. This model has impressed me."
2,Nice idea... reusable zip ties!,I gave these a try and they are pretty good. They are wider than the normal zip ties which can be tricky in tight spots but they seemed to work well where they would fit. I wish they sold packets of various lengths.
1,Flimsy,"Sleeves too narrow, flimsy material. The company was awful too. The product took 3 months to arrive."
1,excruciatingly unoriginal,"I'd heard about this book--with all those marketing dollars, who hasn't? Started reading it, and the more I read the more I began to feel a sense of unreality that this particular book is getting so much marketing attention. It's nothing but a passably written string of cliches wandering through a maze of better writer's ideas. After reading 200 pages I gave up in disgust. The publishing industry created celebrity status in the young author because of his youth and got away with it. But I do know young people who are very original and profound, even wise in their thinking. This book is excruciatingly UNoriginal, lacking in depth, and the style of writing is immature at best. Bottom line, if you buy it you're only proving the marketers right--that the public can be led by marketing dollars, even turning a silly imitative book like Eragon into a bestseller."
1,diablo II,"...this lousy game STILL runs slow... unless u have the super computers used at space shuttles dont bother geting this game......ALSO, THERE IS A BUG IN THE GAME WHERE PEOPLE CAN STEAL UR PLAYER ON BATTLE.NET"
2,good for the price,The receiver of the images complains of the images not being bright enough. And the USB cord could have been a little longer.. but otherwise i have no complaints. clips on easily on my HP notebook. is small n cute. n is one of the most economical webcams inthe market!
2,Thank goodness for resale!,"I was so HAPPY to find Super Dad on DVD. My childhood memories held such fond impressions of Bruno Kirby' character and the water skiing scene and Bob Crane's girly screams. Now I see some hilarious editing (the teens are filming dad from the boat but the family movies play back long shots from a neighboring boat - you know what I mean!). I enjoyed it long enough to view it again years later, loved the story, but packed it up the next day to sell to another. Enjoy the visit to the past!"
1,corny church music,i don't understand why people are being nice about this album when they know very well this album sucks i checked it out to see what it was cause i liked the artwork but just listening to it made me feel as im listening to corny church music i usually don't put down an album cause theres always something i like about it theres always songs that i like on the albums of kiss but i just cant find anything i like about this one sorry but the elder album of kiss sucks i DO NOT recommend getting this kiss church music.
1,quality and performance,bought 2 of these and got them installed last night in a 02 mustang in a cabinet that was bought from attrend. the subs are way too inferior to do any kind of low end audio. i suppose that its the age old issue of not getting something for nothing.
1,Keep looking for it...,"I've enjoyed Michael Thomas Ford's writing in the past, but this story is poorly written, poorly edited and extremely shallow. I couldn't help but think that Ford was just cranking out a story to meet a deadline. There's no depth of character in any of the main figures. The story line seems to serve no purpose other than to connect the over abundant and graphic sex scenes, some of which are extremely brutal. If your looking for a good story with believable characters...keep looking for it."
1,total disappointment,doesn't stay upright. Middle heavy and too much money for something well made but useless. I love vacuums but this one went right back.
1,Terrible waste of money!,"My orignal order of this 3D disc did not play at all in any 3D mode so I returned it. The replacement disc plays but there is no/zero 3D content in the actual ""3D"" movie except in the advertising at the beginning. What a waste of time and money!!"
1,a misleading title...,"I got this book for Christmas off of my wishlist. I had mistakenly assumed that it was a survey of blonde myth in culture, in which I would have been interested in reading. Unfortunately, this book is really a collection of stories about the author's life with a little myth interwoven. I'm extremely disappointed and couldn't even finish it. The title should not say ""Roots of Blonde Myth in Our Culture"", it should state: ""Personal Stories that Have Little to Do With Culture""And another thing: where in the world is the INDEX? How can the author use direct quotes or paraphasing and not site anything??? Maybe I would want to read a little more about the books or people she talks about - oh wait, I can't, because she apparently didn't have any other sources. When I was getting my English degree, I was taught that not siting any sources was called plagiarism. I think that's the thing that bothered me most about this book."
2,Works Well,"I bought this to heat garage when I'm working on motorcycles, I'm glad I did it heats very well. Burns a 20lb tank in 10hrs on high. I would say if you own the garage invest in some insulation and a quality built in heater, but if you rent like me this works good enough."
1,Oh . . . y'know . . . it's poetry.,"I dearly love Ric Ocasek's lyrical ability, and I even spent some time as an open-mic poet myself. But still, what can I say? It's a bunch of poems recited against various backgrounds of musique concrete. They're good poems. I liked the chick's stuff better than Vega's. (Surely they knew, going into this project with a pop mega-star, that they would be referred to as ""Vega"" and ""the chick""! No, I don't feel guilty for forgetting her name!)I especially enjoyed sitting and reading the poems from the booklet, in peace and quiet. The actual recording was a one-listen-only type deal. I don't even ATTEND poetry readings any more."
1,This thing sucks.. Just not dirt,"About a year ago, I purchased the above model/serial number and since then, i have been nothing but disappointed with the unit. My dining room and living room carpet is a little older and not a very fluffy carpet, and this unit simply scatters the dirt back at me. I can actually feel dirt bouncing off of my shins. The only room that i can effectively use the vacuum cleaner in is my bedroom, it has a thicker carpet. In fact when I move the vacuum after I have finished ""vacuuming"" there is always a little pile of dirt that the vacuum can't manage pull up into the canister.I also own a cordless combover unit that I use for my kitchen floors. This has zero suction power. In fact it can't even pick up the little piles left over by my normal vacuum.Time to kind a new brand."
2,Just as described!,I liked that they were honest about a little damage to the box. It arrived faster than anticipated. Great product and service. Thanks!
1,Not good for petite moms,"I had heard from a friend that this is the thing to have so we shelled out $50 for the pillow. I'm only 5'1"" and it is way too big. It's just too thick for being under my belly, and it's just cumbersome in the bed. The cover is cheap, extremely low thread count. The back support, however, is nice.I'd only buy this if you're absolutely miserable. Otherwise, I'm going to just stick with a traditional pillow."
1,She needs an editor!,"The book is full of poor spelling, bad syntax and random commas. Phrases such as ""Marshall law"" instead of ""martial law"" render this book nearly unreadable for anyone literate."
1,Way too much graphic sex,"I got this book for my kindle and had read others from this author before. I also thought she was a Christian author, it surprised me that there was graphic sex in the book. I never finished the book and would not recommend it."
1,How to ruin a good movie,I have never written a review before but this movie was so disappointing I felt that I had to begin now. The main reason that I felt so strongly was the fact that Vanilla Sky is a remake of a very good movie called Open Your Eyes. Vanilla Sky while not straying from the story failed miserably on all levels of movie making. Cameron Crowes use of rock songs for the soundtrack missed the mark and his rewrite of the script just missed the whole essence of the movie and the characters. I recommend Open Your Eyes which has Penelope Cruz also over Vanilla Sky 100% but it is in spanish and you have to read subtitles but it is worth it.
1,Alpine KCE-422i Broken/Loose connection,"Alpine KCE-422i iPod Connection Cable arrived quickly and in a plastic pouch. The cable connects somewhat loosely into my Ipod Video and wiggles around. The cable must be pushed upwards slightly to enable stereo output. When it is not being pushed up, only my right speakers work. Broken wire or bad connectors are my guess.I now have an Ipod with a rubber banded cord wrapped around it to supply constant pressure on the loose connection. Works, but for a simple connector that costs this much I would hope that it least worked all the time.Connector connects poorly. Perhaps shipping with better packaging would help.Would not suggest this item to a friend."
1,"ILL FITTING, AND NOT THAT GREAT LOOKING","I bought a Jawbone about two months ago after seeing the early reviews and commercials about the noise reduction technology and designer styling. After constantly struggling to have it stay in my ear far enough to hear on it, I'm giving up. I've tried all the ear loops and earpiece attachments, even tried attaching an additional Jabra eargel I read about to help keep it in place and none of them help achieve a snug fit that will stay in my ear. As far as the styling, it seems big and clunky to me, sort of a good looking design in the box, but a bit goofy looking on the ear. I've just ordered my third Plantronics 510, (I lost one and broke one)which is still the best fitting, best performing, and most comfortable for all day wear and heavy use."
1,"Good, but not good enough.","I tried using this at Mons Venus on Dale Mabry and Tampa. Let me tell you, they didn't work well at ALL. After the initial shock of ""making it rain"" wore off, these girls were really pissed off. I ended up face first on the pavement outside, thanks to one of the bouncers. If your looking for realistic money, I suggest you keep searching."
1,Poor fit,Poor fitting battery. Never held a charge very long and died a painful death. Will stick to DeWalt from now on.
1,He Can Do Much Better Than This...,"This supposed ""sequel"" to his spectacular hit LP ""Night and Day"" (early '80s) lacks all the warmth and humor that made that earlier record such a success.Here, Jackson employes latin drum beats and urbane lyricism, similar at times to the style found on Night and Day. But this new album has a cold, calculated, brittle feeling to it. There is absolutely nothing here that can match the sleek ambience of ""Steppin' Out"" (from Night and Day) for example...I was very disappointed with this CD overall... fans of Joe Jackson should seek out the new Live In New York instead(energetic performances of many of his classics, plus a few surprises).Those who are interested in a good starting point for Joe Jackson should try the Hits collection, which has been re-mastered and contains 17 of the best songs from his career.But avoid this one (Night and Day II) at all costs... it's tired and wearisome and boring and simply does not represent this artist at his best."
2,This music defines the word CLASSIC.,"I am 18 years old and this music is classic. Some people may say it's old people music but this is the kind of music that will be around for years to come. Those 4 men are extremely talented and outstanding artists,who are definitely around today wether people want to admit it or not. They are world known musitians who open your mind up to a whole new type of music that you will never get tired of listening to and will enjoy for the rest of your life. These 4 CD's are incredible and will never be replaced in my CD collection. These CD's are 100% recomended and guaranteed that you will listen over and over."
1,Terrible feel to mechanics,"I didn't try the tubes (I'm sure they worked fine), but they ground together so terribly when I opened the box that I didn't want to get them close to my camera. I found them very hard to move and I didn't like the release latches, either--had to push too hard to get them apart. The Kenko tubes are part plastic, but work perfectly (and smoothly!) with a nice fast 50mm, making for great macro photos--I recommend them instead."
2,His Future Is Bright,"This album got me thinking about Bill Evans and how pivotal he was to the direction jazz piano has taken. As another reviewer said, Glasper is the real deal. His amazingly intricate playing at times sounds like a refreshing shower of notes pouring down on you. He's always melodic, rhythmic, and rewarding to the ear. And his playing stands up to repeated listening. I saw Glasper's trio live at the Vanguard recently and the house was packed. It's clear Glasper is at the beginning of what I hope becomes a long, successful career. Although there are many competing players out there, Glasper has a real feel for a tune, which permits the listener access to work with him on it. He did a beautiful rendition of Autumn Leaves (not on this album) that I hope he records on his next album."
1,don't read this book,"i actually liked ""the bridges of madison county""; so i anxiously checked-out this book. i was totally turned off and was not able to finish it. silly story and poorly written. this happened to me several years ago and i still remember the suffering. to put this experience into perspective, i always enjoy reading novels and don't remember walking away from any other books so upset."
2,Warriors: The Darkest Hour,"After reading Book #1-#6, I have to say that I haven't been so enthralled with a series and it's author, for many years. They were so well written and descriptive, that I had a hard time putting down the book(s). I was transported into Fireheart's and the world of Thunderclan and totally immersed in their daily life, struggles. I have recommended the series to my 12 year old grandson, who I am sure will fall in love with the series. Thank you Erin Hunter and keep up with your magical stories."
1,"ok, nothing special, wasted money","it works, but no more than cheap ones. A cheap blade and rainx would have same effect. After one month blade is already streaking windshield."
2,Gotta Love It,What can I say? It's a magic 8 ball. You ask it questions and it answers truthfully. Fun for all ages!
1,graphics card,Not sure if it is my cpu processor or graphics card... but the new 7900 Nivida did not work. It caused lines and other distortions. Put my old card back in.
2,Much better than the 22-oz. version,"Although others have mentioned the longer handle on this 16-oz. version (compared to the claw hammer), it does allow plenty of room to choke up on it to strike the right balance. Unlike the 22-oz. version, this one was easier for me to handle throughout the day. Most of the time I'm driving either 1.5-2"" finish nails or 3.5"" framing nails for various projects. This works great. Thanks Stanley!"
2,mashala shahrzad (i praise shahrzad),this lady wholooks like a copy of her mother partor noori ala a famous poet.this cd is greatm after she split from silhouette this is her first album. the songs have great meaning and the songs are nice too. the song our story is the highlight of the album it is very nice.
2,"""Fast Girl"" A Hit for The Tractors","When, as a kid, you've planted a seed, it seems like an eternity before the little sprout comes poking up through the soil. Well, The Tractors planted a seed when I first heard their sound on ""The Tractors"" (1994, Arista Records). A little over a year ago, I heard that the next cd was on it's way. And, it seemed like an eternity until ""Fast Girl"" got here. It was definitely worth the wait. Steve Ripley has put together a beautiful thing. From the toe-tapping, put-a-smile-on-your-face ""Babalou"" to the heart-touching ""Ready to Cry"" (which includes some of Leon Russell's piano playing magic), this cd put me on ""Higher Ground"" from start to finish! There are a heap a' artists who contribute to the success of this cd. And, Ripley's musical sensitivity and technical genius come through on every track."
2,Iceman Soundtrack,"The film was a little corny, but like many movies of its kind, the music was excellent. A good soundtrack will always have a strong musical theme, which is reprised in many different scenes throughout a movie. The Iceman soundtrack is hard to find, which almost makes it a collectable. I recommend the music, and possibly the film over half a dozen imported beers."
1,"Yes, there's are better Yimou Zhang's movies than The House... and Hero","Yimou Zhang took a great novella by Su Tong, added red lanterns, and made one compelling beautiful film. However, the transfer of this DVD is a travesty. From the appearance of the main titles one would think this is a bootleg version of the film. The scratches, the poor sound quality, and the inaccurate English subtitles make the watching of this DVD a painful experience. It's a shame that such a visually and musically stunning film has to suffer from corporate greed. Do yourself a favor... See this movie on Bravo."
1,NOT REALLY A LUNCH BOX,"This lunch box was actually too small and too flimsy to be used as such. My grandson puts Disney miniature cars in it, instead. Once he filled it up, the latch would barely stay closed in order to hold the contents. Basically, it's a cheap piece of metal with Disney Cars painted on it to justify its price."
2,nice,"I got 43 opks and 13 hcg, i will keep every one posted on how it goes, test can before it said and was really nice"
1,NEGATIVE 4 STARS!!!,"This is the worst Trance cd I have ever bought. I would rather chew broken glass then listen to this cd again. Every song was cheezy. The mixxing was completly amature. There hardly any blending Just a bunch of slaming the crosfader over to the new song. If I were to have spun this cd it would've been the worst cd I ever did. The label reads something to the effect of best vocal trance from europe. I would hardly agree. The lyrics are like a 4th grader, with a SERERIOUS substance issue, in the early eighties wrote a couple of poems and they were made into trance songs.The best song ( in my opinion ) was on disk 2. The track was called falling its #4. Its sad though cause the lyrics have a really similar melody to Lange's- drifting, and its amazing how the beat and synths as a matter of fact the whole song sounds like a bad re-make of tiesto's - flight 646.Sad Sad cd... : (Shame on the producers and dj of this cd.But the cover looks really cool : )"
2,Amazing,"There are only 3 songs on the cd, but it's been in my cd player on repeat for longer than I'd like to admit. I wasn't a huge Aimee Mann fan before this either. The only thing I've heard from her was Voices Carry. I bought this because I liked the song Save Me, but I totally fell in love with the other two tracks. Her lyrics are so well crafted and intelligent. A truly talented songwriter."
2,Tast of Autumn,"This is a great book filled with lots of great fall recipes. My husband was skeptical of some new ones I tried from the book, but he ended up loving them! Fantastic series of cookbooks too!"
2,All Dancers Are Students And Teachers!,"This is a wonderful addition to the literature on ballet. The auther makes her apologies in the beginning for not being able to include some noteworthiy teachers, but the ones she was able to cover are great. The information provided gives us valuable insight into the aesthetic principles of these great dancers and teachers. This should be useful to all dancers, whether they teach or not. Some very esoteric facts can be found here as well, such as why Balanchine likes the fingers and hands held the way he does and why many don't like it that way. I had taken some classes with a Mr. Schabel and discovered his claim to fame in these pages. The Great Jean Babilee is even discused. You might also get some good ideas for further reading in this book as I did."
2,About My Car.,"Hi there, I would just like to say a few words. I have a 1982 Grand Le Mans, and I am still driving the car, because of this book. With the help of the book, I recked my whole car apart, and then I re built it. I love my Grand Le Mans, and I would not change the car for any thing in the world. thanks for listening."
2,Can You Say Metal Rules?,"This CD is very, very good....the DVD is worth the purchase in of itself. Surprise!!! there is a 12 minute epic as the last track."
1,Must taste good,This product seems useless for its intended purpose. My dog has not peed anywhere near it. She does lick up the spray whenever I spray it someplace. Save your money for carpet cleaner.
2,Spaetzle Noodles,This type of spaetzle maker is easier to manuveur than the old press kind and much easier on the hands. The difference is that this new spaetzle maker makes smaller noodles than the old. It is great for us elderly that don't have much strength left.
1,Dull and weighed down by jargon,"In high school, I was assigned to read this book and do a paper on it. It's one of the dullest books I've ever read, because there is so much unfamiliar sea-jargon that I was unable to visualize the main characters' surroundings. The plot was dull, I could care less about the characters, and after reading it, I could not describe what had happened plotwise. I think this book is appropriate for sea-lovers, because they would find the sea terminology interesting, but for the lay reader, it's like being thrown overboard without knowing how to swim."
2,a must for Xena/Lucy Lawless fans,Certainly a very interesting addition to a collection for Xena and Lucy Lawless / Renee O'Connor fans. Seeing how it all began with their performances and seeing them still very young.Very nice DVD.
1,Bad Dogs Need It Good Dogs Deserve It!,This is without a doubt the worst book that I have ever read. This man must be a dog hater. I have never in my many years of dog training ever heard such rubbish. It should be banned from your list. It doesn't deserve one star.
1,The Worst Book I Have Ever Read - A Total Waste of Time,"K.A. Applegate must have been angry at her publishers or editors for making her write this book. What she did about it was punish her loyal readers. I can't believe she would take readers who stuck with her through 50+ books and cheat them the way she did. No loose ends were tied up, no adventures were had, no funny lines were said, and *nobody* gets a happy ending. The tragedy that happens in the first part adds nothing to the overall storyline or the dramatic tension. The ending was bitter and hopeless, worse than ""Sophie's Choice"", but without good writing. THIS WAS TO BE A CHILDREN'S ADVENTURE, NOT A TRAGIC PSYCHODRAMA!!!! I advise all readers to avoid this book and imagine your own ending to the story. I'll never read anything of hers again."
2,you've gotta give them a shot!,"After listening to this cd, not to mention seeing them play shows, I can easily tell you that Instant Winner is an awesome ska band. If you like any ska at all, you've got to give them a shot! I promise, you will love them as much as I. They're an amazing bunch of musicians, and I think they will go very far in the future. INSTANT WINNER RULES!"
1,Two words describe this book - REVISIONIST HISTORY,"This is NOT history this is the ramblings of a self-admitted socialist. In his version of history America never did anything good it's just a greedy, imperialistic, manipulative, racist, bullying nation.I believe in telling our history warts and all but Mr. Zinn's viewpoint is definitely skewed.If you want TRUE American history, don't use this book."
1,Hand wash only.,"It's possible I missed it in other people's reviews, but this is a hand-wash only mug. Additionally, the whole open/close knob on the lid doesn't really perform as one would want. In my case, the darn thing just always stays closed. Yet again, I've been beat down by ""improvements"". Next time, I'll buy a mug that doesn't have moving parts."
1,Don't waste your money,Strings starteed coming out on my first run. My face was dark with all the stuff that came out. My friend said I looked like a fireman that was just in fire...
2,"heyyy, i hurt my friend","this gun is so freakin awesome, i shot my friend cuz we were having an airsoft gun and when i warned him about the 1000 fps, he said 'no problem."" then when we were playing and he got hit he said, ""ouch, get me 2 the hospital"" so, when you use this gun, be very careful. i also like that it has a one year warranty, cuz my brother bent it, so im sending it back, and the .177 caliber is pretty exxilerating.thanl you, if you buy this gun, please be careful. you dont want to end up like my friend billy who lost him arm and eye from my this guncya, have fun!!!"
1,WORST ALBUM EVER!!!!!!,"The Barenaked ladies most recent album is simply terrible. The song ""One week"" is lame and has dumb lyrics like ""like Harrison Ford, Im getting Frantic""....These guys are by far the least talented act out there currently. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Steely Don,"As a long time Steely Dan fan (as far back as ""Can't Buy A Thrill""), I thought that perhaps I passed over a hidden gem in this album. A friend of mine loaned it to me and all I can say is that it would've been better titled ""11 Tracks of [junk]""! This CD is unlistenable! I tried to imagine what it would sound like if the tunes had been sung by Donald Fagen but that wouldn't even help this weak effort. I honestly can't find one redeeming thing about it. Walter's vocals are about as unemotional and monotone as one can get. The compositions are predictable, uninteresting and amateurish and I've heard better production values in people's studio bedrooms. It's amazing to me that Mr. Becker is half of the writing team of one of the most brilliant writing duos of our time. As well as the CD title, the band should change their name to the real writing/singing strength in the band ""Steely Don"""
1,"I danced, and I pranced, and I pumped this up","OH MAN.OH.MAN.This album is the super duper tops of the sugary sweet Nelly catalogue, I LOVE IT. ITS LIKE CHRISTMAS, IN MY PANTS, JUST KIDDING WINK WINK WINK.Seriously, I loved this album because I got a clean version but then I was hanging out with my friend Oscar and he had the dirty version and it burned...it burned me deep down inside, I couldn't believe Nelly cursed. I thought that when he rapped those little silent spots were part of his flow, not curses being censored. Oh well I still love it.IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS BUT THE CURSING BROUGHT IT DOWN TO ONE, LOVE YAAZ NELLY.One love!- SteveP.S.Nelly, call me."
1,An anti-relativistic author who freely employs relativistism,"This book is meant for the easily duped and for those who wilfuly close their eyes to hypocrisy. Mr. Johnson does not attempt to analyze and understand history, he tries to turn into a battle between good and evil. He criticizes relativism, yet is extremely relativistic himself. An example: Mr. Johnson claims that the Soviets committed a wilful act of terrorism when they shot down a Korean airliner. Yet merely a page earlier attributes the American shooting down of an Iranian airliner as a mistake attributable to the extreme tensions of the Persian. The author fails to mention any of the ""red-baiting"" in 1950s America, yet freely condemns others for similar repressions. For Mr. Johnson, Anglo-America can do no wrong, even if it is similar to others that he condemns. When trying to condemn relativism, it doesnt help to be relativistic. Hypocrisy does not prove your point right."
2,a must see,"I wish this film had been view sooner in our nation, perhaps the elections may have been different, We used it in our small group meeting,., was very good."
2,Stories that challenge your mind,"When I was in the fifth grade my teacher would, on fridays, read on of these ""holey"" stories and we would take the class period to figure out the rest. It was so much fun and it was also challenging. I never really figured any out but ever since then I remember a bunch of the stories. Plus this is five years later."
1,HORRIBLE MACHINE,"I purchased this machine because of its high star rating from so many other customers. The machine worked fine the first time I used it although it took an hour for the ice cream to get to a firmer consistency. The next night when I wanted to use my gelato maker again---it didn't work. I turned the machine on and the churn paddle would no longer turn! I called customer support listed in the manual, and they were of no help. Save your money and buy a different machine!! I wish I had!"
1,Never heard of this book.,"for starters I never heard of this book, and second I would never in a million years even consider buying it. That book could have every page lined in gold, and I still wouldn't touch it....sorry !"
2,Everything to Gain,"I really enjoyed this novel. It showed the cause and effect from lack of communication. If only Caroline and Derek had sat down and talked over their issues, they would have been spared six long years of unnecessary heartache and longing. However, like the secondary characters, we are all looking for guarantees but there aren't any guarantees in love. Caroline and Derek took that chance and true love once again withstood the bumps in the road called life. I also enjoyed visiting with Zoe and Ian and Caroline's brother, Jason, and family."
1,A Mediocre Introduction to Wicca,"Having just come off the high of reading Starhawk's ""The Spiral Dance"", I was enthusiastic about reading this selection from one of the most popular names in modern Wiccan writing. I was rather disappointed. Ravenwolf's authoritative tone combines with her disjointed writing style to make a book that is difficult to read and contains mediocre content. Additionally, the tone she adopts makes it seem as if her version of Wicca is the only version and all others are nonsense. I found this attitude repugnant from a wiccan author. Some of her rituals are good along with some sound advice from time to time, but don't make this your introduction to modern Witchcraft. You'll be disappointed. There are much better books to read first and much better authors to learn from. After reading this selection, I found myself surprised that Ravenwolf is so popular. Personally, I won't be reading any more of her work."
1,Barnga- few ideas and lots of useless paper,Very disappointed in this book. It is basically a glorified and expensive card game with a book that comes in 6 languages while you only need one! Very strange way to make money....expected much more!
2,Perfect,"I have no words for this this book. Just one. Perfect. If you didnt like this book, you need to stop being so pessimistic."
1,Horrible,"Don't waste your money. I got this camera a while back and it's been nothing but problems. Camcorder was sent back to JVC 2 times for the same apparent problem. Both times they did repair the problem but after the second time i knew that i problem had a lemon. Of course, now after the warranty is up I get a message that the operation is paused due to condensation. That's too many problems for me I will be thinking twice before buying any more JVC products."
1,Far From King's Best,"While I'm not surprised that most people are gushing over this book, I am surprised that others have picked up on what I have griped on about W&G. The interlude/flashback story was for me a real chore to get through. It was like reading a young adult romance novel. The hero and heroine perfect and flawless mentally and physically versus the bad guys who either slept with whores or were ugly outside as well as in. It was completely unrealistic and boring and irritating to read. The closest thing I can think of is watching a James Bond movie. You know what's going to happen before it happens and the characters (Susan the stereotypical strong female heroine) and storyline (hint, don't blame me, it was ka.)were predictable and poorly drawn. Forget the trouble with the Dark Tower, someone needs to put right was has been plaguing King's writing these last few years. The sickness has even spread to the Dark Tower."
2,Made an excellent Christmas Present,"Actually, I've never watched the movie - but my oldest son had it on his wish list for Christmas. The ONLY place I found it (Director's Cut, Digital Copy) was on Amazon."
2,32GB in Canon HF100,"No problems in about 5 months with the Canon HF100 camcorder.But be sure to note-- ALL the SDHC cards will *require* an SDHC card reader. They will NOT work in an older SD card reader. (that includes this card, although it's not a fault with the card-- it's the SDHC standard)."
2,Classic,"You might not agree with them all, but a clever twist on deciding, when should a show end? AN in depth guide to when the funeral started for popular TV shows, this DJ on the Howard Stern Show is right on."
2,Great Book,"The Sabbat get an update out of the cliched manaic with a chainsaw in one hand and torch in the other and finally become a full blown sect. Clan bloodlines are discussed, merits and flaws, etc etc. What's REALLY exciting about this book are the exploration of Sabbat politics, packs, and rites. The 'bad guys' never had it so good."
2,Not for the faint of heart,"The opening line of this film has a doctor telling Emma Thompson that she has stage 4 ovarian cancer. Thompson plays a very tightly bound English Metaphysical Poetry professor, an academic terror to her students. Her reaction to learning she has cancer is completely intellectual at first. The movie is about her personal journey with the disease as she gradually comes to emotional terms with her situation. As she evolves with the cancer, she also evolves in her thinking about life, what she has valued, and what she might have undervalued. This is a wonderful psychological study, The movie is thought-provoking beyond imagination and will stay with you a long time."
1,This Is The Worst Game Ever Made,"This is the worst game out of Road Rage and Hit and Run, I thought this would be a great game but I was wrong. [...] she surprised me by ordering NASCAR: RUMBLE, the best Nascar game ever made other than the ones on just tracks and not open roads.I have Road Rage and Hit and Run. I would recommend these two games instead of this stupid game, Skateboarding."
2,Worked as Planned,"This memory worked just as planned in my old desktop. No surprises, just snap it in."
2,A new flavor!,"I tried this on grilled chicken and it was very good. It was mostly sweet with a little spicy kick to it. I wouldn't call it hot by any means though.By itself on the chicken it felt like it was missing something, so the next time I cooked it with breadcrumbs and sesame seeds and it tasted even better.Overall it was a nice combination of flavors that I'm not used to having."
2,Crisp Killer Remastering - ELP Reigns!,"Finally, these superb performances get the exquisite treatment they deserved! You really can hear the difference. As you know, with some remasterings - you end up asking - where's the difference? Yet here, if you know this music - you'll hear a huge difference. The occasional muddiness of the original recording is gone! Carl's drumming is so crisp & punchy. Keith's piano is so much more articulate in this rendering - You'll hear things you never heard before.And can I just say the obvious - Thank God for great music like this. It's so rare these days. ELP knew how to do it - and they did it so right! I still think this is their best work. Not one track slacks. It kicks your butt from beginning to end!"
2,Good reviews on Amazon,Bought this to give as a gift to a Tiesto lover. Did a lot of research to choose it - it had very good reviews compared to other compilations. She never mentioned if she enjoyed it but I think that's because all these artists and their groups have podcasts now so no one is limited to a single CD of music!
2,An Amazing Album!!!,"A great combination of orchestral and heavy metal. The arrangements are very complex and interesting, not to mention that Kahn is the MAN!My favorite songs would have to be all 3 in the Elizabeth trilogy which is based on the infamous Elizabeth Bathory. Great songs and great interpretations.This was the first album of Kamelot's that I got into and I definitely recommend this to everyone!"
1,"DANGEROUS for some, HELPFUL for a few, NOT to be taken as Gospel","The reason for the varied reviews is strictly related to the varied personalities out there. This book is great for the ""Type A"" women out there who are married to what Debi Pearl described as ""Mr. Steady"". It is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS both emotionally and relationally, not to mention physically, for the mild and passive wives who are constantly told by well-meaning Christians to continue being submissive and to ""win their husbands without a word"". If I had read this book 6 months ago, it would have been tragic for me. But thank God, I was given 'Boundaries in Marriage"", which is what too many passive spouses haven't read, but need to. And the other reviewers are only too right about her putting all the responsibility on the wife. This is dangerous and unbiblical."
1,cheap hat,"For the purpose of keeping the sun off your neck and face, this hat hardly fits the job description.It would be the perfect size for a toddler but the ~3.5 inch brim is simply not enough material necessary to block sunlight (a baseball cap is more effective).The cloth sheet in the rear is also too small. You walk around awkwardly adjusting it because every time you turn your head it gets shifted about. If it were longer and weighted down it would stay put.Finally, I thought the material would be nice (looks like canvas) but really its just a cheap nylon/cotton towel shaped like a hat. It looks like something you would win at an arcade.If you think these are exaggerations keep in mind the hat is priced like an expensive piece of sports gear; these things should uphold worst case scenario weather performance standards.I returned mine immediately after receiving it."
2,Really Intense - Thought Provoking,"I am a serious Tonex fan. I just got my copy of this CD and evokes such emotions in me. It's like witnessing someone's personal meltdown, honest, raw, and intense. It's like looking at something so painful you want to turn your head away, except you're listening. It's depression set to music, it's reflective. The truth is we've all been there at one time or another and he does a good job of capturing these feelings, as well as the conflicts and afflictions of those attempting to live a Christian lifestyle while engaged in battles of the mind, body, and the spirit. The musicianship of this work is excellent and true to form in terms of what we've grown to expect from Tonex--he keeps it interesting. Anyone with similar struggles will get it, and be ministered to. Definitely not your grandma's gospel, but ageless honesty real enough for this generation."
1,Not what is advertised,"The stand arrived this afternoon and the first thing I noticed is that it is NOT a Yamaha product as advertised and it does NOT fit my Yamaha keyboard as advertised.It is advertised as having height adjustments. Well, yes, I guess it does, but the height adjustment changes the width of the stand making it less useful.I can make it work, but I am not happy about having to jury rig it and am not happy about Amazon advertising a product as something that it clearly is not."
2,Balanced perspective,"This book is a very balanced book on disciplining children. I'm sorry for all those out there who've been abused by parents, but spanking and beating are entirely different categories. Please actually read the book before posting a comment. I was spanked as a child--spanked, NOT beaten, NOT hit, NOT slapped. I do not resent my parents--I love them dearly. I do not sit around and think about how I was ""wronged"" by my parents because they ""abused"" me. Give me a break."
1,OK for my purpose,Got it only for sailing on my boat. First day using it I scratched the crystal. I can easily read the dials when I cannot sometimes read the digital but it is an OK watch for a work watch.skratch98
2,love it,"I am so happy I could buy this book for a very good price , I believe in natural remedies for illnesses , and this has a lot of detailed info about food helping our body to heal itself , I definetly reccomend it."
1,Too short and fairly low quality,"This compilation does contain his most essential hits, but it has only eleven songs. Also, these have not been digitally remastered and the sound quality is inferior to other releases, so your money would be much better spent on one of the more recent anthologies or retrospectives. However, in addition to original recordings of the classic Cash songs, ""Ballad of a Teenage Queen,"" ""Guess Things Happen That Way,"" ""The Ways of A Woman in Love"" and ""Get Rhythm"" all make for good complementary tracks. No liner notes or any information apart from the track listing, no photos other than the one on the cover, just a shoddy release. I cannot recommend this CD unless you are able to pick it up for really cheap."
1,OMG so bad,"This movie was all TALK, nothing else. To compare it to The Thing is absurd.It barely rises above the minimum for acting as well.Not impressed, a waste of 3 bucks.Peu ~!"
1,Come Back To Me ?,"Vanessa really got the beat going in high school musical . But now that's she a solo Um ??? I am not very impressed with her new solo . Although she has close ups on her looks i do not think people are looking enough at her music . I do not like her voice now . She must be overseeing herself as ""I can do High School Musical so I can be my own solo"" . So now we can come back to loving you ? Um NO! Every time me and my brother hear her song "" Say OK "" we block out her sound by saying "" Do Do Do Do Do... ."
1,Byzantine Analysis,"A Moment To Decide purports to be a careful and erudite study of the renewal movement within the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). In fact, it is neither. Its ""research"" is superficial, its analysis Byzantine, and its conclusions McCarthyesque. The only finding with which I agree is located on page 87 - ""The Forum is a driving force behind the conservative renewal movement's growing political power at PC(USA) General Assemblies ..."""
2,Works great for me!,"This compressor has worked great for me. I like that it is somewhat powerful and also light enough to pick up by hand. I also like the oil-free aspect of it - keeps everything clean.I use it to run an impact wrench, keep a fleet of cars tires pumped up, and run a diaphragm pump. It has plenty of power for more than that."
1,excessively complex,"The idea is great. The book covers a good amount of C++, and then moves on to MFC. The execution of the idea is terrible. It seems Mr. Horton spends more time showing off his abilities as a programmer then he does trying to explain the concepts. My teacher used this book in a college MFC programming class. I hardly ever touched this book, and was forced to use others for reference. Almost everything I learned about C++, I learned from lectures and other books, and everything I learned about MFC, I got from ""Practical Visual C++"", which manages to focus on MFC while teaching it instead of focusing on an excessive amount of trivial C++ code. If you want to get a good feel of C++, get ""Beginning Visual C++"" by Tony Gaddis. It covers more then the first half of Horton's book, and explains it well (unlike Horton). True, you might end up spending a bit more money then just by buying this book, but at least you'll have an idea of whats going on."
1,The Cat Who Killed Lillian Jackson Braun: A Parody,"The Cat Who.... Series have been my favorites. I was excited to read this parody. What a disappointment. The writing was very pedestrian and very unappealing. Using the ""gutter language of the times"" makes me think of a young person who is using words to shock his/her parents. I don't use that kind of language and really don't want to read it. My suggestion would be for the writer to invest in a good dictionary and find words that are acceptable to most people who read good or even great books. Just because it is a parody there is no need for base language. Cleverness is in the idea not the use of poor language."
2,Best four hours ever,This is so funny. The various stories Kevin smith tells are hilarious. The one about his wife is hilarious
2,Sleep Solutions,I bought this for my sister who was battling ovarian cancer. She had used this while she battled occasional insomnia.
1,I lost 50 pounds but...,I stayed on this diet for 8 months and lost 50 pounds but now I'm impotent. Whats the deal?
2,slap shot fan,"Slap shot is an old school hockey movie. Take it from me, to be honest it is one of the best hockey movies to date. Slap shot is about a hockey team that was going through a rough time and will to anything to win. The team is the Charlestown Chiefs. This movie was made in my hometown of Johnstown, PA. The chiefs are known know as the Johnstown Chiefs in the ECHL."
2,One of his best works,"Class envy, sex, the twisted media, drugs, personal relationships, marriage, pop culture, politics, racism, God; he tackles these issues any many more. This may be O'Reilly's best book. He breaks up the paragraphs in each chapter with ""Talking Point"", ""Viewer Time-Out"", ""Ridiculous Note"", and ""This Just In""; this adds to the humor and fun. His program on Fox radiates loud and clear in this short read. The last two chapters are entitled Bad and Good respectively; each highlights an organization, object or person that fits the bill (pun intended). I may not agree with him on some of the important issues, but I still enjoyed the book.Wish you wellScott"
2,Great for Red Dwarf Fans,"The commentaries are hilarious, although sometimes hard to understand. (There is no closed captioning for the cast's comments.) There is, however, closed captioning for the regular episodes, which I really appreciate. Sometimes the studio audience is laughing so hard, you can't understand what the characters are saying. If you have seen the Smeg-Ups or Smeg-Out tapes, you have already seen the outtakes that are on the DVD. The booklets in the DVD's are not very detailed, just some info on what to look for in each episode. I would have liked more background material. They also should have provided cast bios on the DVD. The picture quality is excellent. A must buy for any Red Dwarf Fan."
1,Weather Station,"Product works well, and has some nice features for a Bedside night stand. Unfortunately the size of the information, makes it hard to read if it's more than several feet away."
2,"Great, lightweight stroller","I bought this stroller not expecting much because of the cheap price, but I have to say it is a lot better than I expected. My six month old does well in it and likes it better than the big stroller he was used to. My only complaint is that it is difficult to collapse (easy to unfold though) because you have to use your hand to unlatch the lock so you can fold it. Other than that it is a breeze."
2,To the kids that reviewed this after I did.,"To Athens, you've gotta be kidding me when you talk about her abandoning her 'special moments between characters'. You have to be, 'cause there's at least one, maybe more. To Tessa Lee, I *almost* cried during the book. I just cried today when I was reading it, during that unexpected, bizarre part.PS What I mean by the bizarre part is where there's a serious lack of them understanding each other. Y'know, the part where he's yelling at her."
2,Bright for one AA battery!,"This is a great flash light, it just need a single AA battery. It's also very good, cause it will turn to red if the battery is low. I use re-chargeable battery with it, what makes a great combination that saves my pocket!"
2,"The ultimate ""want list"" for American Bisque collectors!","This book is very well done and easy to use as a reference guide. It has extensive collections of planters, banks and cookie jars as well as other ware produced by the American Bisque Pottery. The history of the pottery was extensively researched and really interesting. The photography is just fabulous and there are some very rare pieces shown here. In my opinion, having collected cookie jars for over 20 years, I think this book is a ""must have"" in your research library. If you're like me, you will enjoy looking at it over and over just for the pleasure of it, but it will also help you put together an awesome collection of your own and prevent you from mistaking reproductions for the real thing. In today's world that could save you a bundle! I recommend this book very highly."
1,Worst Werewolf Movie Ever!!,"The only good thing about this movie is my all-time favorite singer, Justin Hayward from the Moody Blues, sings ""Something Evil, Something Dangerous"" during the opening credits. That's all."
2,Love this shoe,"Very comfortable, but the style tends to run big. Had to order a 1/2 size smaller, and it's still a bit large.Style and comfort - what a combo!"
2,Best headphone,"I had this, audio-technica M50 and Bose QC15. After 2 weeks, I returned the other headphones.Bose QC15 was worst among these three for music. It was good only for noise cancellation.M50 was great sound for the price ($150).This is the BEST sound I have ever had. Both Mid range vocal and treble are very smooth and clean. Base is tight and precise. Unless you are in tight budget, you should get this one. Look no further.This is open headphone. The person seat next to you can easily recognize the song you are listing. This can be an annoyance for some people.I take away one star because of comfort. I feel pain after like 30 min of wearing this. But I still love it's sound and have to adjust it so I can wear it longer."
1,"only heats a 15 gal tank, not a good price",I orderd this tank heater for my rv's holding tank. I looked everywear for the max tank size it heated because my tank was a 30 gal tank . I couldnt find this info in the decription anywear. When the heater came in only then did I find out the heating spcs . I returned the heater unused . You can find a brand name heater for $20 or so more elesewear if you need one for a larger tank than a 15 Gal one
1,Waste of time and money! Don't bother!,"I was surprised this book even got published. It is way overpriced and altogether a disappointment. It was more of a ""very"" basic recipe book than how to save money on food. Mary Hunt's ""How to be a Cheapskate"" had tons of ideas how to save money on food and cut cost. If you want to save money or get ideas get Mary Hunt's book-don't bother with this one."
1,BUMMED..No power!,"Bought the Memorex Mi3005, for my son.($100) Worked fine for a little while but now, it won't power up- Thought maybe we needed a new power cord?? The green light on the cord lights up, but nothing happens beyond that! After reading other reviews- I realize it's probably a manufacturing ""poor quality"" issue. What a waste! :("
2,"Pretty good, but kind of small","This salad spinner is great for a very small head of lettuce, but cannot hold enough for me to buy a large one. This is a problem for us because we eat a lot of lettuce and can't hold a lot for a later time if we want.The other problem is that I was dumb and put the plastic lid that came with it in the dishwasher and it shrunk; it doesn't fit anymore. Other than that, it is a good spinner-- good system, and is easy to use. Plus, it is nice looking, which is always a bonus. The bowl is useful as a back up mixing bowl or a serving bowl if necessary."
2,sea witch,given the video years ago by bob and saundra.. even better i was fortunate enough to have spend several weeks in 1993 aboard Sea Witch and sailing with this wonderful couple in Tonga. video only touches the tip of the adventures they experienced on this 5 year journey with their family. bob and saundra if you read these reviews... that trip was one of my life highlights.... remember stephanie haha...
1,Her voice completely gone on this album.,"This CD is really only for collectors who want to hear this particular concert. However, be prepared, Chavela's wonderful voice is not to be found on this album. All the songs are familiar, but the voice isn't. Her voice cracks constantly, forcing her at times to speak the words rather than sing them and to remake the song to avoid the difficult notes. The crowd is boisterous too often calling out to her in the middle of a song-- which makes the CD hard even harder to listen to.You would not give this CD to introduce him to Chavela. There are much better albums for that: the hard to find ""Volver, Volver"" being the one that most springs to mind. As I mentioned previously, this CD is only for collectors who feel they must have every last album of hers. If you think you're one of them, I'd still suggest that you try to find a site where you can download and listen to a track before committing to this album."
2,Delicious freeze-dried fruits,"These are delicious, nutritious, convenient, no bruising, no mess, no throwing good food away because it's over-ripe. Excellent delivery time, too!"
2,"Compelling tale of war, history, romance and survival","This is a wonderful, readable book about the people who lived through the Japanese occupation of the Philippine Islands during WWII. The story is told through the experiences of 4 different characters. Their experiences are captivating and informative, A great way to learn the history of the war in the Pacific. Read about the prison camps filled with American and British citizens. Learn about the guerilla efforts that helped win the war. I highly recommend this book ist has something for everyone!"
2,great album,a very good album. somewhat hard to find. George Adams is a beautiful player. highly recommended.
2,Really amasing !!!,"When learning chinese astrology, you should have a guideline. That's you'll have when you read this book, although this book only give the main guide, not the detail's one. Also -- this book -- gave me another perception about how to calculate ""lucky stars"" which is different from what I've learn for past two years. I think this book will help all beginners and experts to practice it to their lives. Enjoy it !!!"
2,"A ""Home Run""","Randy Spitzer and Rob Lebow hit a ""home run"" as far as my clients are concerned in their new book, ""Accountability"".There are so many great illustrations throughout the book to guide you. It's clear today that the way to true success for organizations is to implement freedom and responsibility without control if you truly want to win in the market, community, company and with your customers.The only reason anyone would not see the purity of the ideas and strong possibilities for helping your culture pay is because they are struggling to give up control. It's been a mantra of business for generations - this kind of thinking is destructive.So freedom and responsibility without control is the future and the future is now. Again, well done again - can't wait for your next book!Rich RowePresidentAmerican Advancement Institute"
1,"They should not advertise a ""flavor""","I didn't expect a whole lot. Just simply that these tasted like peppermint. There is an nice smell, but hardly anything worth mentioning as far as taste. Might as well have nothing on it. Waste of money in my opinion."
2,I was surprised at how much I liked this book.,"Though hesitant to purchase it at first, I really enjoyed this book. I've never been a waitress, but it made me feel as though I had. Admittedly, it's a bit self absorbed. You might think, Who is this woman? and Why should I care about her life story? But Ginsberg is a natural storyteller who drew me right in. This slice-of-life book illustrates the warm relationships the author shares with her family and (mostly transient) friends, as well as the sometimes bizarre, funny, and horrifying interactions she has with her patrons. I found myself eagerly turning the pages, and yet not wanting it to end. Highly recommended."
2,Such Sweet Reading,"This is an excellent book for the jazz experts and for the ones who are only familiar with the more pop-jazz acts, like Sade. Well, I fall in the latter category and I found myself really getting into ""Such Sweet Thunder."" At fist I thought that the book would only appeal to the jazz pros, but I was proven wrong as soon as I read the first few chapters. I learned so much about this true American art form by reading Baszak's book. At the same time, ""Such Sweet Thunder"" enabled me to branch out of my pop-jazz comfort zone and begin to explore other aspects of jazz."
1,Enough already!!,"I have all of the Solstice releases. This will be the last I buy. It sounds more like the ""Easy Listening Jazz"" FM stations that are franchised around the country than Christmas. I used to put the CD's on at night with the tree lights on, house lights off and the snow falling outside. The collections were a perfect blend of ambient mood and beautiful sounds that REALLY sounded like a secular holiday moment. I was convinced they would be the new sound track of the Holiday's. A good thing has gone too far and is no surprise that Windham Hill not really being Windham Hill anymore would drop the ball."
2,excellent service,i got it for a killer price and it arrived when they said it would. what else do u need?
1,Not that great,"I'm afraid I have to agree with the negative reviews here ... unless you're a Captain Britain fan, not even psylocke and rachel summers can save this graphic novel from itself. Mediocre at best and not necessary for enjoyment of the entire House of M experience ..."
1,Real cause for concern,"Yes, this book is well written - but Chapter 6 'The New Age Movement Enters Christianity' - left me deeply disappointed and concerned. Here writes an author who completely dismisses the very scriptural Baptism of the Holy Spirit as being counterfeit and not of God.This is the gift from God, clearly promised by Jesus himself, which descended on His followers at Pentecost and subsequently empowered/equipped them to do His work on earth. I can only pray that Michael Whelton re-thinks, and asks God for this wonderful Baptism himself - soon."
2,Barbie house 4 stars but minus 10 for S/H,"Good Value as long as you accept it will arrive ""as is"". Came shipped without any packing as if I went to a store and took it off the self. Of course if I had, I would have looked for a better condition box[or is it the shipping and handeling that caused the wear and tear and crushed box edges or the scraped off sections of the Barbie photo labels that are on the box?] Better yet, I would not have left it in plain sight on my doorstep exposed to the winter elements, or worse, to theft, until I got home from work. It's up to you to decide, if the lower price is a good value?"
2,Great!!,"Great controller, works all of the time w/o any issues. My only gripe is that I can't turn off the controller to save the batteries. That would be nice. So far I've had to replace them twice, I just have to remember to remove them if I'm not going to play for a while.The only other thing is that the receiver was/is designed for the older play station. It tends to be a bit thicker than it needs to be for the slim version and it raises it up just a little."
1,Waste of 50 bucks,"To me this game was a HUGE disappointment, I spent 50 dollars on this game and there is hardly anything to do with it. Unless your into doing the same thing over and over and over again then go ahead and waste your money. but all you do is be spider man, chase a guy, the guy hurts civilians, save the civilians, chase some more, than fight the guy. Thats all you do as spiderman. and as venom you chase, run away, and fight. Nothing more to it. sure there are the city events and races but those are boring. Not to mention the game can be beat within an hour. The only thing remotely fun is swingin around the city, and even that gets old after 15 minutes. I do have to give credit to the graphics though, they're pretty good. But if you wanna spend 50 dollars on a game that takes an hour to play go ahead, otherwise I suggest waiting until the price drops down to 10 bucks."
1,not real silver,"these earrings were very cute! loved them until they started to turn a brownish like color, that is definatly not silver!"
2,Much Poetry in this book,"Just a short qoute from this book will give you an idea of why it is a gem: ""I lived on the prairie all my life, so a line of oak trees can still astonish me."" This book of writing about existence on this earth, nature, and self reflection is for all those who have a poetic sensibility. It's clear observations are themselves astonishing. It is not off-putting, as it could be, if it were written from the viewpoint of a self-righteous preacher."
1,False Advertising,The fan does not have 2 120 volt outlets for connecting other tools or appliances as advertised.
1,The Worst Toy I ever Bought,"This is the biggest waste of money I have spent since we had our 17 month old! The microphone does not work after the first day, and the cartriges don't advance properly...So my son is learning about the color yellow as Joe from Blue's Clues speaks, but my son is looking at the ""BLUE"" page!I am truly disappointed, and I would not recommend to anyone this toy.It is a wonderful concept, and very easy for a little one to use...But you would think Fisher Price would have done a little more durability testing with it BEFORE they put it on the market!"
1,Not for KRZR K1 as advertised,"I desperately needed a battery for my KRZR K1. I ordered this only to find when it arrived that it is NOT the battery for a K1 and does not work, but rather is for the CDMA version of the KRZR, the K1m. As Wikpedia puts it: ""A GSM/EDGE model is released by AT&T, Rogers Wireless, T-Mobile, and Cincinnati Bell Wireless under the name MOTOKRZR K1, and a CDMA/EV-DO model was released by Pocket Communications, Verizon Wireless, Sprint PCS, US Cellular, Alltel, Bell Mobility and Telus Mobility under the name MOTOKRZR K1m. The exact features and technical specifications differ somewhat significantly between both models."" You want the SNN5779 Motorola BC50 for the KRZR K1 (GSM)."
1,Humming Noise,"Quick points:1. After 4 years, a loud humming noise developed that makes it unusable2. Make sure you have enough space because this unit is unnecesarily huge. Check under product details for dimensions.3. Did not improve sound or video quality for me in Los Angeles. Other users may have experienced better quality based on where they live and who their energy provider is."
2,a movie to show life can be changed,this movie can show us anyone can get in our head and minds but whatever we under take know what we are about to do is what we really wantthis movie has oscar in envy for the way the people all of them act off each other is perfectwillam as gacy well he has always been one of the best as a actor and more then super as bad guy but in this he out did himself in a way he should be proud see this movie and learn from itwho plays who or who is more of a fool the fool or he who follows the fool
2,Great,"My parents dragged me with them to see this in the theater, and I was blown away. The catchy tunes and great dance steps won't soon be forgotten."
1,"Kind of just, well, empty...","My son went through a phase where he loved anything caveman. This book got a lot of good reviews. It's ok, but it's very short and there's not much to it at all."
1,Shame on you Disney,"I had high hopes for this movie. I expect when I watch an animated movie from Disney with my children about Christmas I do not need to screen it ahead of time. I was appaled at how scary they made this movie. Did they really need to have Marley's jaw come unhinged and flop around..and his face rearrange. This movie scared the hell out of my 7 and 5 year old children. They said it should be called a Halloween Carol. To me it was just boring. I was so disappointed and ultimately a little angry that I had to spend the night up with my children who had nightmares over it.I would not recommend this to children under 10 at all. From now on I will make sure I either watch it first or clear it with a friend that it is ok. It is a shame I have to do that with a cartoon. I was expected something warm and uplifting, like the Polar Express. This was the opposite of that. I HATED it."
2,Overall: Good,"The first, eighth, and eleventh tracks on this CD were awesome. It was one of the best recordings of Conzertstuk I've ever heard. The second movement to Mozart's 4th was superb, and Corette's horn quartet was equally superb. However, the rest of the songs (while good) weren't of the best recording quailty. But the playing remained magnificent. I would definitely reccomend this one to any horn afficionado."
1,A travesty of the John Wyndham book.,"I wouldn't normally waste time on something this bad, and I'll waste as little as possible here. This movie is a remake of the superb 1960's movie, and both are based on John Wyndham's 'The Midwich Cuckoos'. Please, please do yourself a favour and read the book. If you've already seen or get to see Carpenter's movie, you'll suddenly be able to understand many points that he has left obscure or obliterated through cheap tricks and fumbling attempts to 'update' the story. And you'll appreciate Wyndham's exceptional intelligence, imagination, and uncanny ability to capture a community's time and place and its reaction to the incomprehensible."
1,Ummm...,"I really hate this show. It's too innapropiate for kids. In ""First time at the beach"" Laura touched Kana's butt when she swam!"
2,History brought to vibrant life,"'Lord of Samarcand' is an excellent collection of some of the best stories ever written by Robert E. Howard, the writer who, in his all too brief career, created such memorable characters as Conan the Barbarian, King Kull and Solomon Kane, to name but a few.Howard's historical stories may be less well known than those about the mighty-thewed barbarian, but show him at the peak of his narrative powers: set in the Orient at the time of the Crusades, these grim, blood-soaked tales bring history to vibrant life as only Howard could. Rewriting history in the guise of fiction was one of the things he loved most, and his suicide in 1936, at the age of 30, robbed the literary world of a very talented writer that had only begun to hit his stride.So enjoy these tales about Godric de Villehard, Cormac FitzGeoffrey and Red Cahal, to name but a few of the grim-faced giants whose bloody exploits are told in this excellent volume of The Works of Robert E. Howard."
1,Worthless!,"Recived the Tv Broken. Amazon did not package it correctly so the tube fell out of the case. Tried returning it for a refund, they sent the SAME broke TV back with a remote and manual. What's up Amazon? The 3rd party sellers I deal with have been much better with shipping and returns."
2,Original Zombie Movie: Better than Most Big Budget Flix!,"This is a great little movie. If you're a zombie fan, it's definitely worth your time and money.For the most part, these are Romero zombies: Shoot 'em in the head types.It's the survivors who are different. Who expects swingers to also be survivors??? I never had before, but THE STINK OF FLESH changed my mind. Certainly it would take people willing to 'think outside the box' to survive the pending zombie apocalypse.My wife agreed that this was the rarity: a movie where you CAN'T predict what is going to happen next. Wow!The acting is mixed. Some of the co-stars seem lucky to have remembered their lines. That's okay. The main characters do a fine job and the gore is reasonably realistic.And I think I'll have nightmares of Dottie before I'll have nightmares of zombies...!"
2,Bargain price and OK quality,"I wanted to buy something I could use on my laptop and something that is not expensive, and this web-cam serves the purpose. If you are looking for a webcam for your Skype or any other IM client this is OK, the resolution is pretty low, but that was not the purpose of this purchase."
2,A picture book of the story of Noah's Ark for children,"This is a delightful picture book. This illustrations are intricately detailed and appealing; and since there is only a small bit ot text in the beginning, there is time to study and enjoy them. My own children have loved this book for years. I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to make Bible stories come alive for children."
2,"Along with FATBOY, this could very well be my favorite song!","This song is great. I was first introduced to it while whatching a great (and funny) movie called NOTHING TO LOSE. The main character had accidentally lit his shoes on fire and was dancing around to this song trying to put out the fire on his shoes. It was hilarious, and the song was an excellent choice, for it really emphazised the excitement and hurry the man was in to put out the fire.The song starts out with just a jumble of ""un-lyrics"" if you will. The artist merely makes quick noises with his tongue. It is very interesting and creative. Then the actual song is just excellent. With the fast, deep singing, about how anybody can do anything. Its a great song: Inspiring. Creative. Fantastically wonderful!Order this single RIGHT NOW! You won't regret it! I dance to the song every day now, and I am even listening to it for inspiration while I write this review. KUDOS TO GEMINI FOR PERFORMING AN EXCELLENT PIECE OF MUSIC!"
1,Piece of Junk,"The three speed selector switch gets jammed. The batteries run down very quickly. The clutch only works on the first five settings, after that it's useless. There is almost no trigger control. You can't make it go slow enough. Overall, this drill is worthless and was returned immediately."
2,not bad for the money,"While the glasses were a lot smaller than I had anticipated, they were none the less very nice quality glasses. And for the price, by far the best I could find on the internet."
2,"tasty,","Cracker is good, flavorful and sturdy. Tastes good with most any topping or plain. I have enjoyed all the products from this manufacturer. These were well packaged, I wish there were more per box. Good thing I got six boxes."
2,"A DEFINITE ""MUST HAVE"" book for Consultants","Alan has done it again, as he has so many times before. This is yet another book full of relevant advice, common sense, and just good stuff all round! As with all of Alan's boooks, this is a definite ""NEED TO"" book for ALL consultants who call themselves PROFESSIONAL."
1,Couldn't even finish it...,"Although the book came highly recommended, I found that I stalled reading it about half way through. I found the characters to be one-dimensional and the storyline dragged on and on. Maybe it was just me... However, the book Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942 - 1943 by Antony Beevor was all that War of the Rats was not -- fast paced with plenty of insight into the minds of soldiers who fought, and their military leaders. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in WWII military history."
1,This isn't Neil,"I have to agree with alot of the reviewers, reflected in the title I have chosen for my review. I bought this CD the NIGHT it was released, and have grown up with Neil's music and anxiously waited this release.....but I took it back to the store within 2 days. If you are a Neil FANATIC, you might add this to your collection, but if you are a realist, you will find this recording pathetic...He SHOULD be embarrassed. I saw him recently on A&E's Live By Request and THAT is a Neil Diamond live performance! So, I don't necessarily think it's his age. I do think Neil rules and is quite a performer...just not THIS night."
1,Not good,"This may be a good player but I'll never know. I plugged it in and pushed the button to open it. The carousel opened about 1 inch and that was it. I returned it. (Great return policy by Amazon!) I'll not take a chance on ordering another. If this broke immediately, how long would it last?"
1,fell backward,"My daughter used from 1 year old. Now, she is 3 years old. It's okay. However, when she was 1 year old, she fell backward several times by kicking the table. So, we always step on the base to prevent her from falling backward. I think the reason why the base bar is too short. Except it, we like this chair. It's stable and easy to change the height."
2,Very different,"This is quite a big book, packaged in a pocket-size version. There are so many themes : Love, friendship, betrayal, all tied together in Maon era of re-education.The thirst for knowledge, for reading, is not one that can be easily snuffed out.Human nature is one that will emerge, despite (and perhaps due to) the most excrutiating of circumstances.Perhaps not an ideal ending, but certainly a thought-provoking one.A quick read, but an everlasting one."
2,Tag sale surprise!,"After fighting through the begining of the book,I found the description of both China and her people fascinating. I felt the author really sought out the true China and the hidden feelings of the Chineese people. I was particularly interested in the decoding of the Chineese laugh. I'm guessing the author didn't get many sincere laughs with all the proding questions he asked. A brother of a friend of mine is embarking on a three year stay in China through his work. I've recomended this book to him and I'm anxious to here his experiences compared to Mr. Theroux."
1,misrepresentation,To bad the picture does not show that you only get 4 overpriced balls. When you find them at the store they are only 99 cents
2,Mac OS X,I found this book to be helpful in finding solutions to some of my questions and relatively easy to use.
1,doberman gang posters,"well, i am glad i have 1, being a doberman freak, but...i didnt look close to the details b4 i purchased it. i do believe this was someones old/worn poster that was copied & redistributed. You can see old yellowed tape marks, & other imperfections indicating my ""opinion"". that was my bad for not paying attention to detail! once i compared what i received to the enlarged poster on site it was exact...w/that said once in a good frame & up on the wall it looks great. only i know its not perfect!"
1,GREAT SERIES11,"I was so sad to see this great series come to an end, but at least there was a proper ending with everything settled. This DVD set completes my collection."
1,Not precise enough,"I did not enjoy this book. It is a very high-level view on component-based development that lacks any detail. Often statements are made without further explanation and terms are used without definition. The book does not go into detail how you would group functionality to components nor what makes good interfaces. References to some technology in the middle of an abstract discussion are somehwat irritating.The book is not bad. However, it gives you what you probably already knew and leaves you with the feeling ""and now?""."
2,Scottish Gaelic Music,"Again Julie Fowlis has created a great Cd with outstanding songs. I really enjoy listening to her and can catch a word or two. I have an interest in the Gaelic language for a few years and have managed to learn some of it. For those who do not, the liner notes are in English as well. It is well worth the time to listen to."
1,Fun but Flimsy,"This set includes several cool earth and space vehicles and satellites. Unfortunately it is not durable enough for a 4 yr old accustomed to Hotwheels and other pocket size vehicles; with many of the pieces losing components to breakage. Finding space toys, particularly rockets that are not models for launch or display is difficult. So this toy set has the potential to be fit the bill, but the durability just is not there."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the condition of this book. The book itself is wonderful that is why I purchased it. I thought I was buying a new book, at least that was what it stated, but when I received it it was anything but new. It even has inscription inside it. I intended to give this as a Christmas present, but not with someone else's name in it. Most likely I will not make this same mistake again in buying something that is suppose to be new and turns out isn't. Disappointed really is going easy, I was so excited in buying this book, thought it would be the perfect gift, turns out I was very wrong."
2,Excellent pearl quality! Benevolent price!,"Okay, you may be deterred by the price, thinking it's far too low to have good quality pearls. Well, no offense, but you're wrong.These pearls are surprisingly good quality, and they even come with a GIA certificate! The weight and feel are good. They seem to have been very well matched for size and roundness. Luster is high to medium-high.Well, the results speak for themselves. She loved them and still does."
1,Can not wear with anything low cut,"I ordered this expecting to be able to wear it to a nice dinner. The only problem is, I CAN'T WEAR IT WITH HALF MY SHIRTS! Sure it holds me in fine, but wear it with a V-neck shirt and it peeks out all night. It even shows in a nice cowl-neck sweater."
2,amazing show,"this show is amazing. that is all there is to say. its clever and smart and funny, you wont want to stop watching it. Exploring the world through carrie bradshaws eyes and seeing the way of life of these upper east side women. i reccomend this to anyone and everyone."
1,Pinstripes on a Red Sox Uniform!?,"Pinstripes on a Red Sox uniform!? FAILThis may be cute but if the father of the intended recipient is a real Red Sox fan, do not buy. He will wonder why there are Yankee pinstripes on his Red Sox uniform."
2,Carried Away....,"This book is pretty good and only takes a few hours to read. Like others in The ""Wrong Bed"" series it's shockingly funny. The wrong bed scene is hilarious.The subplot with Vivian & Eric is a bit too much, is this plot from another book the author wrote? They need their own book, if they don't already have it, to take care of their unfinished business.This is Christy & Trevor's story and too much of Viv & Eric's baggage is all tangled up in the main characters relationship."
2,Goodbye to Berlin,"I have only discovered Isherwood's writing in the last three months. I enjoyed this book enormously and I am now reading ""Christopher and His Kind; again another great read."
2,It was the best book I've ever read!,"I loved Harry Potter the Third.It was so much fun I didn't want to put it down.I stayed up late reading it and didn't keep track of the time.I wish the rating went higher.I would rate it 1,ooo,ooo stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Joe Kubert is AWESOME!,"This is a really cool Comic Book Studio.From back cover - In 1976 he (Joe Kubert) opened the first and only school devoted to the art of cartoon graphics: The Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art, Inc. located in Dover, New Jersey.Unfortunately Joe Kubert passed away in August 2012 but he leaves behind a legacy of great art.I don't know if I should open this or keep it as a collectable. the ""Studio"" includes:72-page instruction bookSketching paperPencilSharpenerColored pencilsInk penTriangleBlank comic bookPortfolioEverything you need to make your own comic book. I will end up ordering another just to open it or give as a gift. it would be perfect for an aspiring comic book artist of any age."
2,Only one problem...,"I bought this because I confused James Keane with Jimmy Keane. However, I did recognize Wilifred Horan. This is traditional Irish music with some beautiful harp playing (showcased) on a couple of cuts. (Harp being an instrument I don't normally seek out). Fine players all around. You won't get blisters on your rear listening to this, but it's feelingly done. Lovely and laid back.My complaint - I like liner notes. Nay. I love! liner notes. This was about as thin as it gets. Apparently, this is a part of a series that has to do with food?etc? I don't mind a couple of recipes, but I DO want to know the history of the tunes (who wrote them, etc.) and a bit about the players. Hence the ding from 5 stars down to 4."
2,A fine piece of Americana,"I remember reading this book as a kid. Not only did it expose me to cards and players I never heard of----which was really cool, but I marveled at the style of writing. There were sharp, witty observations and some great humor. To this day, I believe it has left an indelible mark on my own sense of writing style. If you're a fan of baseball, you should probably get it. If you are a baseball card fan, collector or reminicer, it is a must have possession!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I have two shih tzu's that unfortunately love to eat poo (their own or each others- gross!). I tried this product and went through a full month of adding it to their food and NOTHING. Don't waste your money or your time, it didn't even decrease their ""habit"" in the least bit. I talked to my vet and she said she has had more success with the pineapple (1 tbsp/day) and pumpkin (2-4 tbsp/day) that any commercial food additive. On to the pineapple...."
2,Brightest Keychain Light Ever,"I ordered this product to go along with my Leatherman Squirt ps4 which I love also(read my review if your interested). This light is amazing. It's lightweight, you hardly notice it at all and the clip on design is durable and easy to remove if you want. The light itself can easily light up a room and can be seen from far away. It's even bright enough to walk by through the woods or a dark road if your in a bind. Just read the product description, I will attest to it."
2,works just as mentioned,"I bought this to cover up our BLUE alarm clock light. It did exactly as we wanted it to- toned down the blue light quite a bit- in fact, during the day you can't really read it unless you are close. However, at night, it is amazing how bright the blue light remains, although it is 100 per cent better than before. I will probably have to just replace the alarm clock at some point. The film itself clings and is easy to work with. I have a life time supply now."
2,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book was one of the best books that I have ever read!!! It tells of life in the early 1900's and not many books are like that!!! I like how this book twists and turns and leads you to a VERY surprising ending!!!!!!
2,A Hidden Gem,"The Skin CD by the Rainmakers is a very special recording indeed. The band consists of two guitarists, a bass player, and drummer. However, each track emphasizes a different quality in the bands repetoire. Good Sons and Daughters and Too Many Twenties rock n roll with abandon while Different Rub has a great bluesy feel. To The Hum utilizes the accapella and Remember Me By and Skin are nice acoustic numbers.Other tracks emphasize vocal harmonies while others a stunning guitar passage or even a crisp balance between the rhythm and lead. And the drumming styles are quite unique. Furthermore, the lyrics by Bob Walkenhorst are touching throughout this record.Sometimes, a record does not have to be a commercial sell out to make its mark. The Rainmaker's Skin surely succedes on all accounts and those looking to broaden their musical horizons can start right here with this gem. Thank you Jason for bringing this CD into my world."
1,Won't buy from this company.,"This company sells shoes made from the hides of animals; in fact, the majority of shoes they offer for sale through amazon are dead animal skins. If it looks and smells like an animals' hide, and, it comes from a company who sells shoes made from the skins of once living animals - I'm not buying it. A shoe marketed as ""vegan"" won't cause us to overlook the fact they sell products made from slaughtered animals."
2,Great product!!!,"Works extremely well. Just look up the direction of the transmitters of the channels you want so you can properly orient the antenna. I literally tossed this antenna under a bed on the floor (pointed in the right direction), patched the coax from the bedroom through my home's pre-wired infrastructure to the living room, plugged in the little amp, and picked up all the major network stations plus a ton of other channels I didn't even know were being broadcast. Picture quality is better than Comcast HD since the signal isn't compressed, re-encoded, or wrecked by any of their bandwidth-saving attempts."
2,Good Night Sleep without Pain,"I suffer from chronic pain, and stumbled on to this product a few years ago. I've ordered both the Orange and Peppermint flavor Gaba Calm Sublingual tablets and they both deliver.Instead of taking some prescribed anti-inflammatory/pain killing/anti-depressant, try Source Naturals GABA Calm."
2,Good Introduction to Rolling Thunder Review,"The classics are all here and the quality is fantastic. ""Isis"" in particular rocks. By listening to these discs, one certainly gets a great feeling of the 1975 and 1976 Rolling Thunder Revue. My only complaint (and the reason why I deduct 1 star) is because I wish some more of the cover songs which Dylan performed during this period were included."
2,Funny looking but good cup of coffee,"I bought this coffee maker based on it's good reviews. The positives: I really like the fact that you can remove the entire water reservoir and clean it. I automatically use the Flavor+ button every time I brew as it makes the brew a little stronger, which is a nice option to have. The pot has a no drip spout - that is a really great thing! I also love the blue light.I only have minor negatives: I, unlike many people who reviewed, think the machine is somewhat ugly. The big ""dial"" on the front reminds me of an old phone. The design looks somewhat whimsical compared to higher priced machines but it's nothing terribly important to me and its great features outweigh this.Finally, for the price, you can't beat it. I've enjoyed it for 1 month now and hope to have it a long time."
1,Arrived DOA,ZERO rating!!! I had to give it ONE star rating in order to post this review. It didn't work after opening the package and following the instructions. I sent it back and the seller refunded my money. Obviously not the sellers fault but quality control at the manufacturing end must be really poor. A nice idea but cheaply done.
1,No text to speech is a deal killer,"I'm waiting for this book and the next three in the Kincaid/James series to be text-to-speech enabled. Until they are, they're useless to me."
2,Works great,"I bought this transmitter because my old car broke down. I had been using a cassette adapter with my iPod, but my new car doesn't have a cassette player. I had tried a couple of cheap transmitters before, but they just didn't work well - the levels were too low, with too much static.No such problems with this transmitter. The sound comes through clear as a bell, with the same volume as the other stations on my radio. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a player that requires a simple jack, as my iPod Shuffle does."
1,Unacceptable product,"I got off to a bad start with this coffee maker when hot water and coffee grounds overflowed the drip basket and ran all over the counter. I finally figured out that if even a few pieces of coffee grounds had gotten trapped inside the lid, it would block the flow of liquid into the carafe. So I carefully washed out the lid every time I used it and hoped I had made my peace with the coffee maker. But a couple weeks later the lid got cross-threaded and the top of it broke off. Oh, well, the carafe wasn't heavy enough to keep the coffee hot for very long anyway. And the coffee didn't taste that great. Now it's truly a piece of trash."
1,Junk,It is flimsy and a rip off. Good it was not expensive. My husband had tremors and I thought this might help him to eat but it is a piece of junk in my opinion
2,REAL women know the truth,"I wasn't brainwashed by anyone - I was taught that real men love and respect the women in their lives and I was taught how to find a real man. I feel very sorry for the women who hate this book - they are, to a (wo)man, unhappy, unfulfilled, and frustrated wrecks who need something to make their shallow lives seem meaningful.I knew the truth of what Kate O'Beirne says in this book before anyone had ever heard of Rush Limbaugh or Ann Coulter. I was raised in a traditional home where Dad was the bread winner and Mom took care of home and kids - and I was NEVER led to believe that the women in our family were any less smart, talented, able or subject to the men in any way.I've actually read this book. It's well researched, carefully documented, and more than makes her case for her point of view. Really, how many of you ""critics"" actually took the time to READ the book?"
2,Great Book,My mom loves Joan Johnston and reads every book she writes. I bought her this for a Christmas gift. Thanks
1,Arrows not long enough,This would of been a great toy EXCEPT:Arrows are not long enough to pull back for any kind of shot powerful enough to go anywhere or stick to anything.
2,Almost five star!!,Anyone else would rate this book as being worthy of five stars. Especially when you consider that this is Andrew's first published work. I'm grading on a curve because I've read some of Andrew's UN-published work.Four Pallbearers' gritty look at five young men coming of age in a less than perfect world will take you on an emotional rollercoaster ride. You know these guys. You care about these guys. You are these guys.
2,Awesome product!!,"Cool!! This it great baby can see everything. Very sturdy on the bike, I even installed it myself. Works great I always get inquisitive looks from people. Have ended up a couple of times stopping and talking to people about the bike seat. Great Product would buy again and again. Excellent!!!!"
1,it sucks,it sucks. it probably works with lots of practice but it's frustrating because you have to keep washing and drying the cloths.
2,another great movie,I loved this movie! It's good to watch good movies. Wish hollywood would stop with the killing/sex and crap!a must see
1,marylandman,"Came without safety key. Would not start or run once B&D sent the key. Buy in a store, if you must, so you can return it."
2,"Somply, Wonderful!","I asked for this cd for my birthday only knowing one song on it, ""Learning to Fly"" and I simply fell in love with the cd. The songs are wonderfully sang and written. The words really witness to you. ""Grand Scheme"" is among another of my favorites. All the songs are great. I recomend this cd highly to you if you like 4Him."
2,"YES, The Chicks Are Back!!!","I have been waiting what seems forever for the Dixie Chicks to bring out another album!! The Dixie Chicks are by far my #1 band, as they are the only band which I own all their cd's AND enjoy every song which is presented on their albums. There debut song from this cd, ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is the perfect prelude to open their album with. I was a little sad and frustrated that none of my local radio stations had enough nerve to play it. *eye roll* Oh well (I guess that's why I make my own ""radio"" with my pod) However, I do know that when an album rocks like this album does, the radio and general public won't be able to ignore it. Open your eyes people and check out the amazing lyrics, vocals, and instrumental talent. You will not be dissapointed when you discover how much amazing effort and true talent that the Dixie Chicks put into creating this album."
1,Use Once and Discard......,"I purchased these to sharpen chain saw blades. Very disappointed with their durability. After sharpening one chainsaw blade (16""), the diamond dust was essentially completely stripped off the shaft, rendering them useless for further sharpening. I'm going back to using the grinding stone version of the burrs . The stone wears, but at least I can sharpen the blade 5 or 6 times before having to replace the stone burr."
2,Good Christian action thriller,"The Reckoning makes a fun summmertime read; something exciting and involving without being too heavy. Huggins seems to know what he's talking about when describing Special Forces tactics, weapons, survival training, etc. I'd give it five stars, but the Christian content is fairly shallow (the characters are fighting over a manuscript that contains the name of the prophesied antichrist), as well as requiring a healthy suspension of disbelief. After all, since Satan isn't omniscient, how could he know the name of someone thousands of years in the future? Still, I enjoyed the book, and found The Reckoning to be a tense and well-written thriller."
2,new purchase of bible study book,Enjoyed my purchase and it came on time and I was satisified with the price and the condition of the book
2,Psychological progress,"At the conclusion of this book, we realize that there is more to come.Like other reviewers, I recommend that readers not familiar with this series start from book one and read chronologically. The constant thread throughout the Fonesca series is his psychological trip through the healing process in the wake of his wife's death. First, he reaches a milestone where he is able to speak her name. Now, at the end of _Denial_, he finally realizes that he has to find his wife's killer.As a Southwest Florida resident who considers Sarasota a second home, I always enjoy the settings in the Fonesca books. Here, we end up in the Asolo Theater, among other interesting spots.The story itself is right on par with the previous books: Two mysteries that keep you guessing until the end. Lew Fonesca is the quintessential anti-hero--a guy you can root for."
1,no breakthrough,"she sounds terrible, her voice is yucks! and r all her sounds repeating by itself...come on have a breakthrough!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD! I'd give it a 1/2 Star!,"Boy what a bland CD! Overly produced and boring lyrics and no catchy hooks or any really stand out tracks. It look likes she rushed this one out to rake in some cash for the up coming X-mas season. I loved Ray of Light so this is a really disappointment. Plus, it was only 40 something minutes (which is a rip off but maybe it's a good thing in this case). Even her Erotica and Bedtime Stories albums are much better than this. For those that want Madonna to go back to bubble pop, please. Well done house music is fun and great to dance to, not this one though. actually this is not even house music. it's electronic funk whatever."
1,Ingersoll-Rand website doesn't match documentation,"After much research, and reading everyone's reviews, I purchased the IR 2130. I opted for the 2130 over the 2132 because based on information on Amazon and Ingersoll-Rand corporate website, it appeared the specs for two were very closely matched, and I couldn't justify spending the extra money. However, to my surprise, when I received the 2130 today and actually read the owner's manual, it states the recommended FWD torque range is 25 to 350 ft.lbs. However, the corporate website shows the FWD torque range is 50 to 500 ft.lbs. So what's the real value? And why such a huge difference between the website information, and the actual owner's manual? I expected a little better consistency from IR's communication."
1,Broke after 6 months of use,The spring in this gate broke after 6 months of use. I am very dissapointed and out a good chunk of money. Of course its too late to return it. I would not reccomend this gate. The open and close latch on it was a total pain as well. Not worth it.
2,Two Super Buff Chicks With Gauntlets and That Other One,"I started watching ""Cleopatra 2525"" out of boredom. It aired at like midnight on Saturdays next to ""Jack of All Trades"". Single mom with nothing to do except watch a bit of mindless TV or go to bed. After a few weeks, it became my routine to stay up and watch these shows. They were campy and I didn't know I was the campy type.Cleopatra was the beginning of my girls kick [...]/rear/derriere TV phase. Thank goodness it came out on DVD so I can watch some girls kick [...] whenever I want."
1,Mediocre horror film with too many stock shots,Unlike Maltin I find this film no fun. It's too mechanical and riddled with cliches. It's as though some studio executive told a script writer to frame some cock and bull story around shots of Clyde Beatty doing his animal training acts in an old movie made in the thirties
2,Happy with purchase,"I purchase this to use on kitchen cart. I got the board in 2010 and it still looks great. I really do nothing special to the block, clean and oil it and it is holding up well. I use the block on average about three time a week."
2,Very Sweet & Feminine Scent For Your Hair,"I noticed that this scent is more potent when sprayed on dry hair. The perfume was shipped very quickly and for only $1. I have long hair, so it took more than just a few sprays, but the scent lasts all day. It wasn't greasy, but I still avoided spraying it near my roots just in case. It left a subtle shine and helped get some tangles out. I will definitely purchase this again when I run out! It's very Cotton Candy, and also reminded me of Jessica Simpson's Desert Treats scent called Candy."
2,the chase,love all marlon brando movies this is a real oldie but goodie my kids liked it also and they never heard of marlon brando 5 star rate
2,Replacement Filter,Needed a spare and this was the best price plus shipping. I got the item so quickly too!
1,The Worst,"After releasing Emancipation, the Artist returned with a single album. I assumed the Artist would treasure his precious freedom with a strong album. But I just threw it away after listening to it once. It was his worst album, maybe aiming at tarnishing his music kingdom. Ironically, every album released by Warner Bros. is stronger than this! Could any artist become a star with this? But the Artist really became a superstar with 1999, Purple Rain and Sign or the Times! His recent albums Graffiti Bridge, Diamond and Perals, Come, The Gold Experience and Chaos and Disorder are far better than Emancipation (possibly a strong album in 2 CDs) and this rubbish!"
1,Subscribe to a tabloid instead,"This book is poorly written, full of his big ego, and generally just trashy. If you want to read a book about how great someone thinks he is, at least make it a book by someone that has done something useful for our world. Romo spends too much time trying to justify things that are inexcusable. After reading this book, one is left guessing that a) he needed a new ego boost now that he's retired and b) he's greedy and wants even more money than he already has."
2,My son LOVES this,My son received this for xmas when he was 18 mos and loves it. We keep it in his crib and he is always playing with it. He wont go to sleep unless he hears his elephant.
1,it don't have nothing memory card ports,I bought a system with reader cards port but thats a lie because the system don't have nothing at all.I don't know why you advice about a system with those characteristiques and send another totally different.
2,Mermaid AAAAK!,I loved this game so much until I got up to the Mermaid Boss and then I gave up after a whole week of trying to defeat it with no success. The game is gorgeous though and I love the story. It's worth the money even now that I have xbox 360.
2,pretty decent,"great sound and more comfy than ear buds that go in yer ears..lol one problem i have is one of the two sets i purchased, one cord is longer... alot longer than the other side.. so i had to roll it up and tie it with a wire tie.. it doesnt affect the sound or feel but it looks funny..*****EDIT*****Ok so now I understand why the longer cord on one side, lol, I guess its so you can run the wire around the back of your head so its not hanging down in front of you getting in the way and caught up in what ever it is your doing... I wish they would tell us old farts who are used to wearing real head phones and not ear buds and stuff.."
1,No Storyline,"I was disappointed in this book. What could have been an exciting account of the exploits of a very brave and innovative corp of British volunteer desert fighters was a collection of brief and disconnected accounts of battles and skirmishes during the war in Africa. Very little detailed description of the actual battles, some of which were obviously significant, with many men being lost or solid victories by these brave troops."
2,Characters Welcomed,"I will keep this short. I loved the pilot, thought the story was well adapted for television series.USA Networks has some great series, some I like more than others, but if you enjoy spy thrillers and enjoy character driven stories than I believe you will enjoy this one. Annie is not perfect and I like that she is learning the ropes as she goes yet she toughens up."
1,Flashbacks made it difficult to follow the story line...,"As a George Clooney fan, of Dust to Dawn, Peacemaker, and One Fine Day, this supposed comedy fell short of my expectations. Even though I felt there was a sexual attraction between Clooney and Jennifer Lopez I felt the rest of the characters had poor definition and development which contributed to a tedious plot developed by flashbacks"
2,I can't get enough of this show!,"I loved this DVD. The picture is extremely good and the song selection is wonderful. I recommend this DVD to any Engelbert fan, or just anyone who is looking for a good entertaining concert to watch. This is a superb performance."
2,GREAT BOTTLES,"Love these bottles. I know they are safe and they are the only nipples my daughter will use. She is mostly breastfed, except a couple days a week when mommy is back at work. Getting her to take the bottle was a HUGE challenge but she ended up getting the hang of it, although she still prefers the breast to the bottle:) The only downside that I can think of is there are a lot of parts to wash/sterilize, but I also bought the microwave sterilizer and a dishwasher container so it makes it a little easier."
1,"Inferior Product, Despite Brand Name","I purchased these earphones about 4 months ago based on the supposedly ""innovative"" design and the Sennheiser name. My intention was to use them for jogging/the gym, as my Sony headphones don't have a good fit. A total waste of 30+ bucks. The Sennheisers consistently fall out of my ear. I had to go back to using my $15 Sony earphones - the sound isn't great, but they don't fall out of my ear.My assessment of the sound:Highs/Treble - GoodMids - OkLow/Bass - Bad (I'm still waiting for the basswind to kick in).Some folks have written pretty decent reviews, so I guess it stays in for them. I would advise against buying these unless you have a friend who owns them and who will let you try them on for size - they might not let you run in them, but a quick, brisk walk would suffice! Yes, they did fall out of my ears just by walking!"
2,Ugh! - 'Metaustart' (Elektrohasch Records),"Good, straight-to-the-point 'stoner metal' from this trio that comes from Munich, Germany. Saw noted on the inlay card that Stefan Koglek of Colour Haze guests as guitarist on two tracks here - the wailing ""Hermetic"" and the tripping ""Cubicle"". All nine cuts are well played and all but the tunes that I favor are ""In Vain"", ""Fatburner"" and the heavy-duty ""Terminus"". Line-up: Sony-bass & vocals, Martin-guitar and Tim-drums & effects. Should do something for fans of Nebula, Motorhead, Sleep, Spirit Caravan and possibly Monster Magnet."
1,bad phone,I came online to amazon.com to search for a new better phone and came accross this one. I already have it and it is the worst phone i have ever had. i've had it for about almost three years and i shouldn't have even kept it that long. The battery life is EXTREMELY short. i talk on the phone a lot and i cut almost all of my conversations short beacause the phone needs to be charged. BUYERS BEWARE!!!
1,Not the best Tess Gerritsen,I usually love Tess Gerritsen but this book was corny. Her Rizzoli and Isles Books are awesome. I'll stick to them in the future.
2,Bright and digestible material that's excellent for children,"Windrow's children's book The Greek Hoplite is a fairly good book, not groundbreaking, but it would make a good gift to the kid who is starting to show an interest in ancient history. The text covers most of the bases of the origin and lifestyle of the typical Greek citizen-soldier in a very simple and easy to read style of writing. The illustrations are bright and colorful, which makes it fun to read. The only point I wish Windrow would have emphasized more is how independent the Greek city-states were. Other than that, it's a very good book that's almost up to par with what Nick Sekunda has to offer for the younger crowd."
1,Drivers won't install,"I am trying to use this product with an IPAQ 5455 plus expansion pack, but haven't been able to get the Pocket PC drivers to install. Hawking Tech support has not been able to help. If you don't need to install drivers to use this on your set up then you may be ok, otherwise beware"
2,deer call,The mechanical operation of the cans worked well and seemed smooth. The sound quality was pretty good and sounded fairly authentic. Haven't used them in the field yet. That will be the moment of truth.
2,Get Educated!,"For any one considering cosmetic surgery, this book is highly informative and full of important information. I had heard great reviews about this book and it lives up to every one! I feel much more prepared to proceed with the surgery I have been considering. Dr. Kotler's book helped to ease my concerns and allay my anxiety. I would suggest this book to anyone wanting more information about cosmetic surgery."
1,GC200 Garbage can caddy,"Was missing some parts, it comes apart when hauling garbage cans to the street. I would not buy thisagain."
1,"Oh, this movie is bad!","I am angry at myself for wasting an hour and half of the holiday season and spending the money on this terrible film. Bad acting, bad plot. The only redeeming aspect of the film was the handsome lead actor, but that did not make up for all the other negatives of this film. And I am someone who LOVES Christmas movies......."
2,Does what it needs to,Great price for the budget heaphone. My little kids use it to listen to their iPods. No issues as of yet and seems to work just fine.
2,Most comprehensive book I have read to date,"I have read other books on this subject, and yet this book stands bars and stars above the others. It was well researched and well written. I have recomended it to many of my friends as a truly worthy ""Must read""."
2,great for what you pay,mostly cheap plastic with the important parts being metal.it didn't fit my weaver rails (but it was no match for my dremel)over all a great little bi-pod
1,Success and testosterone,"I don't know the specifics of Lance Armstrong's cancer. However, I assume that he became hypogonadal after treatment for his testicular cancer and is taking testosterone, which is an anabolic steroid. The average young male has a serum testosterone concentration between 300 and 1200 ng/dl. Most average around 500. If Armstrong were to take enough testosterone to keep his testosterone level at the upper end of the normal range he would, potentially, have a physical advantage over his competitors. He would also test negative for synthetic steroids. It would be interesting to know what his serum testosterone is."
2,love this stuff,I have continuously bought this multivitamin because of how much better they make me feel. I can tell a significant boost in energy when I take these. I have also noticed a few major improvements including less pain in my ankles (I have injured them several times) and stronger nails. Just make sure to take them with food and don't smell them.
2,Hauntingly Melodic,"I have owned this album for quite some time now. But let me say that the first time I heard it, my clock radio was going off at 8 in the morning. There was a world music show playing the second song off this album. I swear I thought the music so beautiful I believed I was still dreaming. I faded in and out while the song played and finally realized it was my clock radio and not a dream. Don't judge a book by it's cover (album art here is pretty sub-par). The content on this one is phenominal, trust me :) Any album you can listen to year after year and still walk away with something new gets my big 'ol thumbs upper. Thanks."
1,Simply awful... buy the Sennheiser!,"I am a huge Sony guy, but these are some of the worst headphones I have tried. The bass is often overwhelming, the construction is shoddy at best, the plastic cheap and uncomfortable, and they are UGLY! They are huge and don't adjust well. The sound switch on the ears is foolish and useless (makes no difference). They are extremely uncomfortable, especially on the top of the head. I returned these and bought the latest Sennheiser HD202 headphones which blow these away for about the same price.BUY SENNHEISER HD202 instead!!! Trust me!Sennheiser HD 202 HeadphonesI love your TVs, cameras, PS3, and laptops Sony... but you dropped the ball on these!"
2,Forgotten master of the blues,"Paul Garon, the author of the classicBlues and the Poetic Spirit (Roots of Jazz)gives both a biography and examination of the lyrics of Peetie Wheatstraw aka ""The Devil's Son-In-Law"" a popular blues guitarist and singer in the 1930's and 40's but one who did not gain recognition in the wake of the 60's blues revival. Although the biographical data is slim, Garon puts Wheatstraw's career and lyrics into the historical perspective of the development of a citified style of blues that falls somewhere in between the downhome Delta style and the more sophisticated big band and jazz oriented style that was prominent in the 40's. Garon fills a missing link in blues history with this and his longer text on Memphis MinnieWoman With Guitar: Memphis Minnie's Blueswhose ""When the Levee Breaks"" was another example of a blues song being 'appropriated' and copyrighted by Led Zeppilen."
2,Positively Brilliant,"Weiner's The Beak of the Finch is a positively brilliant work on the topic of evolution. A great introduction for the student of evolutionary biology, or the layman. Weiner's book destroys two of the greatest myths about evolution. 1. It's slow. 2. It can't be observed. The study of the Galapagos Finches not only proves the importance of evolution as a contemporary subject but as one that can be observed RIGHT NOW in the world around us. It's almost astonishing to see how simple evolution truly is, how it occurs in quantifiable baby steps that we can see, if we only take the time to carefully observe. Weiner not only demystifies evolution, but makes it as a topic, thoroughly accessible to the interested layman. His prose is neither dry nor technical and in fact, makes for quite an enjoyable read. I wholeheartedly recommend this book."
1,Should be titled Mocha Mud Pie,"Before I purchased a box of this I looked up what Mud Pie is and it sounded good. Upon trying one the strongest taste was coffee and sure enough in the ingredients is ""Instant Coffee"". No one I spoke to has never heard of Mud Pie being inclusive of coffee. Unless you want a java protein bar avoid this."
2,a feel Good Movie,"this is the Kind of Movie that truly makes you feel Good. now on the real, I ain't the best Speller in the world, so watching this film i was in awe throughout this film with the Way Akeelah was knocking those words out the Box. this film also shows that no matter where you live, your background,etc... that Intellignce, Will&Drive are everywhere. you just have to give everybody a chance to reach there potential. i dug how this film at the end brought the two kids together as Winners. we need more films that uplift."
2,Funny story.,"I was in the practice mode getting used to the controls and such when i told the offence (I was on D) to use a shovel pass on their 1 Yd. line. Wel i hit the guy he passed it to and couldn't bring him to make friends with the turf so I started to rapidly hit the {X} button and suddenly the person I was controling literally power-bombed the other guy into the gridiron for what would have been a safety in a real game. But, correct me if i'm worng, that's not legal! Go fig. Pretty good game so far. Out."
2,Pure Love,"This music is sustanence for the soul. The songs have a heavy ""classic rock"" vibe to them, but are fresh and tasteful. Doyle's voice is pure soul butter, and his guitar sounds are like manna sent down from Jimi in Heaven. Doyle's talent is extraordinary. This album has it all. If your soul craves sweet lovin' suckle on this Jellycream, it's pure love."
2,Great Plates,"The Corelle Winter Frost White plates have a simple, clean look. They match any kitchen. They are fairly sturdy, unless you drop them on very hard tile. However, they remain relatively light."
1,good,"I was impressed by the speeches I was able to appreciate and compare in this book. I do not have it now, since I look to Barack Obama for leadership and good speeches. -Dave Chiddix"
1,It talks the talk but it doesnt do the walk,"Greg Bear is an excellent writer, with a fascina ting subject. And he's fluent in the lingo of modern biology, Unfortunately, he comes up short in understanding evolutionary theory. Hey it's supposed to be science fiction, and we all like an ambience of authenticity in our reads. But the problem is that when you lay on the authentic molecular biology lingo so thick and detailed, then outlandish but interesting plot handles become just plain silly. Greg Bear makes enough errors in his supposedly sophisticated appreciation of the biotechnology revolution that someone tra plausible scenariined in evolutionary biology haad to shake his head. Better to keep the theorizing less linked to real science than end up with a supposedly plasible scenario that upon closer examination is plain silly and is NOT supported by such theories as ""punctuated equilibrium""."
1,UGH! Zero stars should be an option!,Ended up in the trash same day I bought it. Worst movie ever! The description made the movie sound way more interesting than it is. I was bored out of my mind. I really thought it would get better but it did not. The characters have no personality. It is painful to watch. This guy ends up sleeping around on his wife. And she ends up having an affair. That is about all that happens. I will think twice before purchasing a movie when nobody else has written a review yet.
2,Broly x3,"I'm a Dragonball Z fan, so i had to get this. The First Broly flix is the best, and the only one that matters."
1,Will not recommend,"I am Indian and could not agree with Lukas Jackson's comments more. I would only like to add one other comment though. I personally do not believe in any organized religion and would love to hear an objective criticism of Hinduism and Islam. But this book did not do anything for me. In fact, what bothers me the most is Naipaul's language. It is very condescending and imperialistic. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Not for Intex Pools,"Well I purchased this in June. Worksed several times then just quit working. I troubleshooted, bought a new hose, new feet. I researched and researched before I bought this product and ended up buying it because most of the reviews were excellent. So I contacted Hayward Pools, Intex Pools and the company I purchased the pool from. I was surprisingly told that these types of pool cleaners do not work in Intex pools. You would need to spend an extra amount of money to upgrade your pump with hopes of even getting any results. the way these pools are designed makes the cleaner get stuck in the corners and sides, its the way they are angled. So I suggest you save your money."
2,"Fabulous ""bible"" for all cooks!","This book begins humbly enough...set out like a dictionary, it lists ingredients and then a selection of recipes for each ingredient. But it is so much more! Not only does she describe the ingredient in detail, she discusses all the important aspects of it, for example varieties, storage, cooking methods, etc. It really comes to the fore if you say, have a particular ingredient that you would like to include in a dinner - just go to that section and there will always be a fabulous selection of dishes to prepare. It must have been a massive undertaking for her to write and I admire the throuroughness that she has achieved. The book includes recipes from all over the world, as well as a few recipes ""that her mother gave her"" (see her other book with this title). Bravo Stephanie - it is my all-time favourite cookbook and reference book in the kitchen!"
1,The book can be half of its size!,"I'm sure the otherworld is absolutely beatiful but do we have to spent soooo many pages describing it?! The plot moves along soooo slow, I almost didn't finish reading it. Now that I did, I wish I didn't waste my time."
1,Weak,"Jeff Buckley's ""Grace"" is a weak album by an all around weak artist. This album is the same old ""been there, done that"" trash that has been killing our music scene says the 80's. A lot of people thought he was here to save music but that is clearly not the case. The only good rock to come out in the past 15 years is the Strokes. In conclusion, dont buy this album--youll regret it..i know i did.."
2,To each his/her own....,"There are a lot of harsh words being said here and elsewhere about this movie, so I thought I'd put in my two cents worth. When viewing a movie like this, that is obviously made for young children please keep in mind it is primarily for their entertainment. Most adults aren't going to find it terribly exciting.I took my son to see it, and while it would not have been my first choice of movie, he loved it, and his enjoyment made it fun for me as well. If you have a child who already loves the Chipmunks, this will probaby be right up their alley. Lots of upbeat, chirpy songs, plenty of action. Alvin is his usual mischevious self, though in the course of the story he does find that he can be the responsible one when he needs to be. Silly jokes and humor, certainly. Some warm fuzzy moments as well (no pun intended). Have a Chipmunk fan in your house? It's worth seeing. My son can't wait to get his own dvd copy."
2,Great CD!!,I recently saw Daryle Singletary at a local small town country fair and he was great!! I already had one of his cd's that I listen to all the time so I decided to buy this one because I love Too Much Fun. This is a great purchase!
2,Awesome pocket knife,This little knife is simply awesome. You cannot buy a better pocket knife for this price. Vixtorinox has been delivering for decades and still does! Unfortunately I am returning this one because someone bought me the Champ version as a present so I have no sue for this smaller version.It was shaving sharp out of the box. Feels and looks quality made. It just had that feel to it..... the feel of awesome.
1,"If not for the nice design, no stars at all!","I bought this product because of all the great reviews but I was sadly disapponted. Yes, it's easy to use and looks great, it does not contain the smell at all - the supposed main selling point of the product! Very disappointed with this product - will try Diaper Genie next. Hopefully I'll have a better experience."
2,Works well ~ PLASTIC-LIKE,"I didn't buy this from amazon, you can get this at WALMART for $15, it should be in the CD/DVD section or the movie section.It's sturdy, might work better on carpet floors, cause it could be slippery on hard wood floors.but overall great for putting DVD's on ~ this is perfect for someone who just wants to put DVD's on the shelves for a decent price.NOT for ppl who are looking for the greatest shelf in the world, for $17 or $15 dollars this is what you'll get."
2,Good book on bad girls,"This book covers a wide range of characters from the early west to recent years. The author makes it plain up front that although he did his research, some of the stories have details that came from second or third hand accounts. I was reminded of a line from John Wayne's ""The Cowboys"". ""If it ain't the truth, it ought to be"". If some of the facts are a little grey on events from 150 years ago, so be it. It still makes for a good story. I especially liked the chapter about the Brown family of Springtown as it took place in the town I grew up in. I have lived here all my life and read extensively about the old west but somehow had never heard about this family. I found the book to be entertaining."
2,"Great DVD, beautiful photography","Having visited Acadia National Park in Bar Harbor, ME, on more than one occasion, I was happy to have this DVD which features a great deal of history and information about the park, but even more satisfying is the stunningly beautiful photography and scenery. A first-rate production, narrated by an old pro, Jack Perkins; if you love National Parks and excellent videography, then this is a ""must have""!"
2,taut thriller..,from the first page until the very last paragraph you'll find a taut action thriller..you'll almost feel the bullets whizzing by in this Somalia saga..and it's all true...what started out as a humanitarian rescue effort eventually escalated into a botched attempt to capture a warlord with Al Qaeda footprints all over the resistance effort before most Americans had ever heard of Al Qaeda..what could aptly be described as the first big battle of the war against terror..
2,BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"By far the best the book I have ever read! This is a great book especially if like surfing the internet! It's an action packed book, you never, ever know what's around the corner! You might think one thing is going to happen, but then it turns out totally different! I disgree with the recommended ages, I think it can be higher."
1,On the HD-DVD relase,"This release doesnt play on Toshiba HD-DVD players. So if you have a Tosh better wait until they release an firmware update (I have no hope that they will be releasing one in 2-3 months).There are many other HD-DVD titles that wont play on Toshiba players, better check out before ordering one."
2,Pretty Decent and Practical,"I have had this bather for two babies. It worked very well for my son when he was small, until he was able to sit on it. Now I use it with my daughter, she is a big baby (9lb 10 oz at birth). And it is plenty supportive enough. Works great in the tub or in a large sink. I'm not sure how well it would work for very light babies, It does have some floating properties, so it may be less stable if your baby is very light.Mrs. Meg Logan"
2,Shipwrecked with Robbers!,"They got along pretty well,then they accused Elizabeth of taking the fruit. The robbers took the fruit,the siding to the hut they built and their shoes.I bet Kim Possible can deal with those robbers and protect the kids."
1,Nowhere near a large,"I got this kennel for my girl back in the states (I'm in Afghanistan). She got a corgi/beagle mix, so I figured a LARGE kennel would be good, but apparantly it's not even close to big enough for him. Major failure."
2,inspiring,"This is a very good show. Inspiring! It makes one think at how others behave if they are treated more with respect and have higher expectations expected of them. The character Sir finally found out that if he treated his students more like adults than like kids, and expected them to act like adults then he was able to teach them how to handle real life, and hopefully be more prepared for their future out of high school. I am glad that I bought this show. I had seen it back when I was in high school."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"Faulty! I get a high pitch sound every time I record. I have spend days adjusting settings, reloading drivers and troubleshooting. I loaded it on to two different computers with the same result."
2,"vivid characters , interesting plot, first paragraph entices","From the first paragraph of Let Us Prey, the reader must be impressed with the description of this ""hit"" . I was . This was all the hook I needed to continue and was very pleased that I did .The characters and style of writing remind me of Elmore Leonard . Branon has a knack for bringing to life obscure personalities . After reading this book I've looked off and on for his next, Devil's hole but haven't been able to locate it as of yet. but after reading Let Us Prey I'll definately keep trying."
2,Best Ska music,If you like rock and reggae and an whole bunch of other music you'll love this. It has a DJ sound affects steel drums and all around great music. The language is fine if you don't ge offened easily. the lyricts are true also no fake gimics
2,Ok bag,"Its cheap and useful. Got what I expected. Do wish, however, that the top nylon rope was a bungee. Otherwise, a good product, its an Everlast like all my equipment. Arrived quickly."
2,My son's 4th birthday present,"My son just received this toy for his fourth birthday and loves it. I was a little apprehensive to buy it with all of the negative feedback I read about it falling apart. However, every time he saw it he made sure I knew that this was what he wanted. I am so happy we bought this for him. It does not fall apart nearly as easy as I thought and read that it would. The little pieces do come off quite easily however my son can put them back on himself. It does not bother him at all. Overall I think this toy is great and would be good for any little boy that loves dinosaurs."
2,High marks for The Greenhouse Conspiracy,"If you like suspense thrillers with a dash of science fiction, you&#65533;ll love this book. The plot grabs you immediately and keeps you glued to the pages until the unexpected and exciting climax. The ending is not only satisfying but ties together all the loose ends. On one hand, the book is just a fun read, but below the surface, the author makes you think about the environment and about how fear can facilitate the loss of freedom. The characters are unique and engaging. In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend it."
2,Day Hike Fanny Pack,"Handy pack for walking dogs or other day-long or shorter hikes were leashes other items can be stored and out of the way, keeping hands free. Could also be used as a camera bag or hiking without dogs."
1,Cheap Junk don't waste your time!,"we recently ordered this screen house to take camping with us. Luckily we decided to try putting it up in the backyard first. We discovered that about half of the poles didn't fit together securely and were cheaply made. As we were unrolling the cover and screening I saw that it already had a hole in the screen and one of the seams along the top had a hole and it had been taped over. It is very poorly made you feel like you will break it just looking at it. I can't imagine actually taking it camping, it wouldn't survive the first day! we are returning ours..don't waste your time!"
2,Perfect in every way,Great Job from the seller. Video is just as described and arrived very quickly. Recommend this seller!!!
1,"Yes, there is a defect, but....","As many of you know, the DVD is defective starting at Chapter 21, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't buy this DVD.What the defect appears to be is simply bad encoding: the colors scramble, the audio becomes skippy and garbled.PS2 can recover from the defect with nothing more than a slight hesitation where the defect first occurs. My DVD-ROM on my computer recovered from the defect after about 1 minute of play time, but my stand-alone DVD player never recovered, leaving the rest of the movie messed-up and totally worthless.I hope this will help someone who wants the movie but has heard about the defect. It really depends on the ability of your DVD player/software as to how bad the defect will come across."
2,"CoD, CoDUO.","This game is, Very FUn. The original call of Duty is required to run Call of Duty, United Offensive. There is one game mode in the Multiplayer of Call of Duty United Offensive called base assault,which is really fun. Also, in the single player you are virtually unstopable and you kill thousands of Nazis. Its also nice that you ALMOST always fight in a squad. Exept for a few missions. Good Game."
2,Great vaccuum kit but just one wish,"My friend bought this hose kit for his garage and also uses it for the entire downstairs of his house including cleaning out his fireplace cinders; no clunky vaccuum to drag around and the noise of the motor stays out in the garage. I was sold on the versatility it offers so I bought one for my townhouse. I can clean my car; my garage; the hose stretches to the kitchen and my wash room; and to the sunroom when the dog tracks in mud and debris. This was a great purchase and my entire first floor, garage and car stay fresh and clean. I just wish they had a more aggressive carpet attachment (rotating bristles would be nice.) That way, I could really use it like a ""central vac"" system in my house. I'd NEVER drag out the vaccuum for the carpet again!"
1,THIS BOOK REEKS,"First of all, you don't master witchcraft. Can you master a religion? NO, NO, NO. You cannot master witchcraft. You follow it, practice it, and live by its one law. This auther calls male witches ""worlocks."" I am a male witch, I am a witch, not a worlock. Worlock means traitor or oath-breaker. There is a chapter in this book called vengence and attack, whata load of TRASH. All REAL witches now that attack and vengence is strickly against the wiccan rede. Keep away from this book. If you want to read a truthfull book on what witchcraft really is, then read books by Scott Cunningham, Silver Ravenwolf, Laurie Cabot, or Ray Buckland. This book should not even be allowed in the section with the rest of the wicca books. It is trash, don't read it!"
1,I disliked the edits in this version,There are substantial edits in this version of Infinity Hold (the first of three stories in the book). In my opinion the edits do nothing to improve the story and in some instances steal the heart from the story to the extent that they make what is one of the greatest SF stories of all time rather poor and unejoyable to read.I would strongly urge owners of the first edition who love the story never to read the reprint in this book.As to the second and third stories they are well writen but I feel they lack the soul of the original
1,This book sounds like 70s material,"I thought this book was terrible. The hero is a jerk, the heroine is a fool, and the plot made little, if any, sense. Many of the scenes were contrived and left me thinking I was reading a romance novel from the 70s. Beating women, forced sex, you name it, it's here. I'm looking for a little more escapist fiction than this novel offers."
1,Not very scary,I puchased the owl in the hopes of scaring off a pair of nesting barn owls. The barn owls are great but the fledgings are a nightmare with their screeching and keep us awake every night. This owl didn't scare anything and they are sitting in the nesting box awaiting the eggs I suspect.
1,Terrible Sound Quality,"This is a poor Sprint phone, full of crackle and echo. When I went in to complain, they did not seem surprised (I was beyond the 30-day return period).Seems that they sell these knowing many people will not figure out what a piece of useless crap it is before the return period is over."
1,"LOOKS GOOD, GOOD PRICE BUT DOES NOT PERFORM","Features on papers are convincing and the product itself looks that it will deliver, however, i get frustrated every time I use this product to shave ice. The Victorio is a much better product in terms of what it was meant to do. The Hamilton does not consistently shave ice. I have to wait so long in order for a cup to be filled with a shaved ice. For the most part, the machine just keep making noise and the ice compartment just keeps turning without shaving the ice. Bad product to buy."
1,"Sorry, not interested","I don't think Star Wars fans are asking for much when they say they'd like the Original, unaltered Trilogy in anamorphic widescreen. But instead, Lucas is releasing a version that is nowhere near up to par with today's DVD releases and is essentially trying to trick fans into believing that the OT is outdated and inferior. Bull. Give me a cleaned up, Original Trilogy over a CGI laden, Special Edition set any day of the week. Like one of the previous posters pointed out, Mr. Lucas, Star Wars fans everywhere really are beginning to hate you."
2,Fast and Easy,Amazon is faster that going to the store to buy this item. I would have to make a special trip and drive 22 miles each way.
2,hindenburg,A young G. C. Scott plays his character well. This historical disaster is well made for the time period it was made in and has some actual footage of the disaster itself. The movie can bring home the magnitude the people feel at the time when this disaster happened. Movie sub plots are a bit thin - this movie explores one of the several suggested reasons why the Hindenburg went down.
2,Proper Due,Jeri Southern really did not get the recognition she deserved when she was at her peak. Too many people compared her to other female vocalists. She was actually a very talented singer. With this collection Decca gives Jeri her proper due.The best song for me is Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye. It is so beautiful and Jeri really delivers on this one. All the songs in this album showcase her range in talent.
2,The Scarlett Letter Plus,"I am an English teacher and I learned that many of my students find The Scarlet Letter intimidating and daunting because of its level of vocabulary. Ever since I found this book, I have recommended it to many of my students to alleviate their anxiety about reading it. Using this book cuts down the time that one has to spend looking up the words that one has never heard of or read, which is one of the reasons why many of my students quit reading this book in the first place. This also helps my students to become exposed to many SAT vocabulary words without having to memorize them from an alphabetized list. The newer edition has thinner papers, which makes this classic extremely portable and accessible. I highly recommend this to any student."
1,"good, but could have been great...","I read this book while taking a Refugee and Immigrant Perspectives class. In the first third of the book, Pybus presented a historically strong case for her heroine (statistics, archives, interviews, etc.). Then, Pybus begins to profile her own journey - nearly overshadowing her writers' pursuit of Lillian Alling. While I found the final resolution more realistic but slightly less climatic than I had been expecting, Pybus' travels and observations lend themselves to the wild Alaskan frontier and the dangers of walking/driving/living there. Overall, a good read but perhaps should be renamed: The Woman Who Walked to Russia And The Writer Who Drove to Alaska. Now I'm off to read Into The Wild..."
1,Lost at Sea,"To describe this book as contrived, meandering, and without connection is to be kind to it. The author must have some purpose in writing it; maybe he was short of cash, had a contract deadline to meet, or was trying to get into the movies. Whatever, it was not to produce a fine work of fiction. Which is just as well because he didn't. I have had it with this type of author (Patricia Cornwell is another who comes to mind) who churn out work that just doesn't justify the expense in reading."
2,ginsu knive,for the job I am using the knive for it works very well and gets the job done. I am very happy with this purchase.
1,A Vietnam War Chronology according to MACV records,"If I had been interested in how many Air Force Sorties were flown each day I may have enjoyed the book. I served with the 101st 1st Brigade in 1968-69 and didn't see any of the action we were involved mentioned in the book. Serving with the 1st Bde of the 25th Inf. Division and the 196th Inf Bde, both in 1970-71 revealed to me no information in this book. I actually threw the book away. Useless to me."
1,"If Leo is a ""Whistling Virtuoso"", then what am I?","I was interested in this CD so I read the two reviews and I'm glad J. S. Ohmart ""fine"" put in his 2 cents as it helped me decide to not bother with anything by Leo Eide. I'm grateful Ohmart included the URL for the NAXOS MUSIC LIBRARY as I was able to hear Mr Eide whistle. Let me tell you, I know that there are a lot of good whistlers out there and Mr Eide should not be referred to nor should he refer to himself as a ""VIRTUOSO."" Blowing air through your lips does not a whistler make. An out of control vibrato makes a whistler unlistenable. He also happens to whistle with an annoying breath included in the whistling instead of a clean whistle sound as I produce. He sounds as if he was whistling through his teeth instead of just his lips. Mr Ohmart, with the money I just saved on not buying this CD, let me treat you to a cup of coffee! I'll whistle you a happy tune."
2,Everything I Ever Needed to Know...,"...I learned from my gastroenterologist! As the third in a long line of those who suffered from what my grandmother used to call ""the screamin' itch"", it's a tremendous relief to finally be able to both name and treat this affliction. Only recently diagnosed, I spent most of my earlier years wondering why nobody else in my class looked like that were trying to smuggle a Rubik's cube. What the heck did I eat last night, a Chinese Throwing Star? It got to the point where I was looking for a milder variety of oatmeal.Unfortunately, the diagnosis does little to help my superiors at the pepper plant understand my (seemingly quite understandable) lack of enthusiasm for my job in Quality Assurance; but once a pepper-taster, always a pepper-taster.Top notch book, beautiful diagrams!"
1,"""SUCKED""","This was the worst film of 2001 but the DVD is good. Ben Affleck was the worst actor in the film. I give Kate Beckinsale a razzie for her smile. I give Josh Hartnett a razzie for crying. And Michael Bay should be ashamed of himself for turning something Historical into trash. If you want to see something great about Pearl Harbor, go see ""Tora Tora Tora""."
2,this is prety good,"I think that this album is good. They havent been out in a long time and they came back pretty strong. My favorite songs are visit me , other woman, come over and almost evry other song on the album."
2,Classic music capturing an era,"Not only was this an incredible movie, the soundtrack captures the essence of the movie. There is such transition in the songs which was the same transition of the times...all leading to Woodstock and an awakening. These songs, not your normal mainstream, just time warped me back to a time I almost forgot. The mix is incredible (White Bird, Today, Follow...). The only complaint (why a 4 star and not a 5 star) is the fact that some of the songs aren't the original artists (Town Without Pity, Sally Go Round The Roses, and so on... but worthy efforts)"
2,My 20 month old daughter forces me to read it nightly,"My 20 month old daughter ""moo""s with the cow on page 1, ""Baa""s with the sheep on page 2, and says ""Shoo"" ever time she sees the scarecrow. The simple-but-attractive art work looks so 3-d like that she was trying to grab the leaves off the trees during the first 10 readings or so.The colors are bright and simple - perfect for a toddler. Unfortunately, the only other books I have been able to locate which feature these characters were 2 sticker books which had ""Choking hazard"" warnings. The stickers can't be used by the age-bracket the book are likely to be read by"
2,Reiki at its best,Billiant learning tool for all interested in Reiki new and old the work book is great to read and dip into i was attuned some years ago and wanted to start again . there is a cv on protection and william Rands extra input of years of working expertise. I would strongly reccomend to all interested in the healing art of Reiki.
1,it was okmovie was kind of lo,"movie was kind of long and boring,my girls got a little bored because the movie was not a attention getter,but for the price ok"
1,Dead on arrival,I spent several days researching which brand of KVM to purchase and decided to go with Belkin. I already had a two port KVM which worked fine. The new 4 port was delivered and I installed it. I could not get it to work so I called Belkin tech support. They are closed on weekends so I called them back on Monday. They said send it back and also informed me that I have to pay for shipping. They sent me a bad KVM and they want me to pay to ship back their defective KVM. I would never buy another Belkin product after this....!
2,This book had me screaming,"I must say I was really surprised that the book had me screaming especially when I got close to the end. The book had so many surprise twists and turns I didn't know what to expect. However, I must say this is one christian novel that I really enjoyed reading. I really applied a lot of the situations and scriptures to my heart. I give the book four stars because I didn't totally agree with everything but as a whole the book had a good plot to the very end. Simply well done!"
2,Good healthy snack!,"Good sweet crunch that beats a candy bar. Low in calories has 22% vitamin C, and no additives. I have also added it to bran cereal and yogurt. Good way to get a serving of fruits in and easy to throw in your bag for on the go. I have tried the organic and regular version and no real difference in taste. Organic costs more, of course."
2,Hands down the best battery tender / trickle charger made,"I own two of these excellent chargers - they are very simple to operate and very durable.The chargers are weatherproof, and you can permanently mount them in the engine compartment with the provided ring terminals, or just use the alligator clips.The charger has a battery status indicator (low / full), and settings for Motorcycle, Car, or Gel battery. The charger cycles from trickle current, to pulses, and shuts off when the battery is full. There is no better charger for winter storage battery tending, bringing nearly dead batteries back to life, or just recharging boat batteries slowly overnight.Finally, I should mention that the current version of the 3300 has some improvements over the already excellent older version (I now have one of each). The latest version includes:- Heavier gauge wiring- Much heavier and more durable alligator clips- A nice zip-up storage case"
2,"Intelligent ""Beauty""","Of all of the ""The Princess Tales"" novellas, ""Princess Sonora and the Long Sleep"" was the first I read, and most likely my favorite. ""Sleeping Beauty"" has never been so amusing. I liked the original story but never truly loved it. I found this book to be a delightful presentation, putting it in a whole new light for me. Now I do love the story. Here, the token Sleeping Beauty is intelligent from the get-go. As a baby, she is granted her gifts by various fairies who attempt to out-do each other, each fairy trying to bestow a better trait than the fairy before her. The parents fumble, the prince is a dud, and the princess rocks the house. Read it now. May it breathe new life into an old tale for you as it did for me."
2,The best Christmas album to date!,"I hate Christmas albums. I very nearly never bought this. But in the end I gave in to fandom (and my wallet) and I'm glad I did. The CD is a new take on traditionally cheesey songs, with most of the Vonda Shephard stuff done as smooth jazz, Macy Gray's voice fitting perfectly with Winter Wonderland, and Robert Downey Jnr surprises everyone by his ability to sing. The contributions by the female cast members are also nice little additions, although I have to complain about Lisa Nicole Carson's all too brief offering. And where's Richard Fish singing 'I love you even more today (than yesterday)'?"
1,Only if you are hard core SF fan,"I grew up reading SF, it was all I did. I was one of those ""nerdy"" kids and didn't really fit in with the ""in"" crowd. I can identify with the premise that someone who is a computer nerd/D&D type could rescue some astronauts and save the day. Having said that, I think the only way you could identify with this book is if you fall into that category. Further more, the anti-Green rants are completely out of control. If this is some kind of humor, I don't get it. I should be the target audience for this book, and I thought it was the worst SF novel I'd read in several years. Perhaps if you go to all the SF Cons and live SF/fantasy, then maybe this would appeal to you."
2,5 boxes of jewels!!,"this is one fabulous box of cds. you get 5 cds full of great material from nate (b! machine). he has the ability to play some music with very nice hooks and his voice is at times hauntingly seductive, making me want to hear more and more. the stand out cds for me were doctors with knives cds. each disc runs around an hour or more so no shortage of music for the avid synthpop fan. another gem from a different drum label.check it out."
1,No Hablo Espanol,"My daughter was very excited to get this game. We popped the DVD in the player and unfolded the mats. The video came on and the menu was in Spanish. I could not find a way to get the language to go to English. According to the instructions, it should come up with a screen of some sort when the disc is put in that gives a choice of languages. We never saw that. I've tried powering down, unplugging, all DVD buttons with no success. Guess I will either return it or send it to a needy child in Mexico."
1,"The sickest, most disturbing thing!",I got the edited version because Im not allowed to get unedited and still it is horrible! Throughout the CD he talks about drugs and violence and killing people. It is just sick and disturbing. it gave me nightmares! If you listen to the lyrics you will understand what I mean. Dont get this unless you wish to be discusted. The only good thing about it is the tunes. Thats it!
2,A new bible for entrepreneurs,"This book is full of wonderful examples of things for the entrepreneur to expect and beware of. I ususally circle a few such key passages in the text of any book, and jot the page numbers inside the cover. I ran out of room to write page numbers!"
1,don't bother,"I watched this film because it earned awards at five film festivals, including Cannes and Sundance, but save your time and money--it's horrible. The dialogue is dreadful, the plot unbelievable, the multiple sub-plots distracting, and the teenage sex ridiculous if not perverse. So, the experts are wrong, including Roger Ebert who gave this film 4 of 4 stars. Richard is separating from his wife Pam and works at a shoe store. He meets Christine, a starving artist who drives a taxi for the elderly, as if we should care. I guess the film revolves around the single line of a senior citizen to the effect, ""Your whole life could be better, starting right now."" Yes, especially if you avoid this film."
1,Woody at his worst,"This was just a very bad film. It was rarely funny and downright painful to watch at times. Woody is way out of his element in New Mexico where this idiotic film is supposed to take place.There is no question in my mind as to why this film never made it into theaters. It would have bombed in a big way. Even though there is a great cast, they don't have a good script to work with so the film falls right on its' face.Don't waste a second watching this huge disappointment."
2,Great camera,"Photos were excellent. But photo print quality depends very much on the print shop. For the same photo file, it can look like a 4M photo when taken to a below quality printer shop. Photos taken indoor with marginal lighting (no flash used) turned out to be yellowish. Battery life is very long despite its large 3"" LCD. Battery charging time is over 3 hours - too long. Photos files viewed on computer looks just great. 8'x10' prints are great but have not tried larger prints. Touch screeen control is a delight and very easy to choose and set. Date on photo is red (would be better if it is black). And the location of the date is not at the far right hand corner."
1,"If you can, buy another model","Okay, many people here seem to be rating a french press rather than ""this"" product; of course a french press is good and perhaps if you hadn't another model to compare to you'd find this fine, but this is a cheap cruddy version of it.I was forced into buying this model because you can no longer find metal ones at most stores (aside from Starbucks I guess), and I had broke my good old one that morning.Cons:Smaller beaker than typical french presses of similar sizeUgly plastic cheap constructionhandle easily pops off if you apply too much pressure to the plungerplastic parts on the plungerplunger doesn't come apartas noted by other reviewer ""coffee squirts all over because the seal is too tight""Pros:Grate at spout keeps grounds out of your coffee (although it filters out the crema too, which might nullify the pro of it)Buy another version. If it ain't broke don't fix it you cheap bastards!"
1,Hard to find,It's hard to find a small compact disk for my embroidery machine. I appreciate it very much. Thank you so much..
1,"Great, if you like cheap knockoffs","I borrowed my sister-in-law's CHI straightener when she came to visit and loved it! I had never felt my hair so smooth, and I was instantly impressed. So I bought this one on amazon, congratulating myself on finding one that was about $60 cheaper than what my sister paid. Terrible mistake. I should have read the reviews instead of just going off of how many stars it had gotten. It is a knockoff of the real CHI straightener in the same packaging. The real CHI is much heavier and sturdier. It glides over your hair making it straight in one pass, while this one painfully catches your hair and needs two or three passes to straighten. Spend the money on a real one from a beauty store! You won't regret it."
1,"LISTEN TO THERION'S ""VOVIN"", ""THELI"" OR ""DEGGIAL""","Please listen to therion, rage, or nightwish, or hammerfall or some others. Without the orchestra this qould have been an excellent album, but the orchestra is totally out of place, of course it has its good moments, but i think there some points in the songs when they should have been in complete silence.This is not original, many metal bands have done this before and better.Someone should teach James to sing ""NOTHING ELSE MATTERS"" his voice sound terrible on this song.After all i agree, metellica is not playin metal anymore, and these days are never coming back, now they are just an american elite band and not what they used to be....LONG LIVE TRUE METAL AND NOT THIS.....LONG LIVE NAPSTER, LONG LIVE NAPSTER, LONG LIVE NAPSTER.VOVIN IS A GREAT ALBUM FROM A BAND (THERION) WHOSE WORKS WITH OCHESTRATION ARE GREAT AND NO LIKE THIS METALLICA ALBUM. I'M SORRY CAUSE S&M WAS A GOOD IDEA BUT MR. KAMEN WAS NOT THE BEST CHOICE FOR THE JOB"
2,Great shears!,"Contrary to the other review, these shears are very good. I have an Italian spitz pom mix and she has a top silkier coat and the bottom coat. I can groom her myself with these shears without having to spend $60-$70 on a professional groom. They trim her coat perfectly the way it grows naturally. I had previously bought other shears that were much more expensive and back they went because they did not trim! These were less expensive and trim perfectly. Give them a try and you'll love them."
2,sad but so good,"it was so tragic and sad...but still a quick read. i really liked this book, it was interesting to view the world from the eyes of a 10 year old girl. creative, great character development, i read it in 2 days. it was sad but also made you think about the power of forgiveness."
2,One of the Best I have ever seen!,"I loved this movie, it was perfect Julia and Sean Thomas Patrick had great chemistry. It shows that people can over come the diffences they have and be together. It had great music and unlike most other movies, it had a great point to it. I loved it and I think it was one of the best movies this year!"
2,The only thing we have to fear is...,"Glassner has identified the USA's Achilles Heel. Fear is what motivates us far too often, and it's what convinces us that a country that never attacked or threatened us is dangerous enough to invade and occupy. Until we recognize the power that largely irrational fear has over us, we are vulnerable to the demagoguery of Washington D.C. and advertisers alike. Great book."
2,MOre than I expected,"This nice pocket sized unit is great for the traveler. I have even had fun using it to search for new resturants in my home area. It finds hotels parking lots, resturants and a bunch more either where you are at or at your destination. I have not used the instruction book yet and find all the functions very easy to use. The screen is plenty big. Consumar reports rated it #1. I can see why."
1,This is a Study Guide not the real Book,"WARNING !!! This book is not the real Book, but just a study guide (has got solutions to the orginal book). Some parts of the description of the book gives an impression that this is the paperback edition of the hardcoer version (# ISBN-10: 0735202389 # ISBN-13: 978-0735202382) And in one of the options in the Hardcopy page this product is shown as the paperback version of the hardcopy. Fact is that both the books are different."
1,Torn about Bust,"On one hand, I like this magazine. I appreciate the interviews for the most part (Amy Sedaris), and I love the retro articles with feminist takes, like the one they did on airline stewardesses. They seem pretty jazzed about women in music, so there are reviews every issue. The mag is littered with plenty of dense, blurbish ""reporting"" on varied subjects, keeping the reader interested and moving along. On the other hand...I don't feel like the mag ""applies to"" my age group; though it tries to keep everyone happy, their main demographic is obviously young women in their 20's. And I have read too many incorrect, flip, trying-to-be-oh-so-young-and-hip and just plain not-well-thought-out responses from Betty Dodson, their resident sexpert. Additionally, I think a magazine like this should avoid politics altogether. It's obviously liberal, considering the recent article on Obama's wife.I don't love it, I don't hate it. I'll just read it at the library or newsstand."
2,Best Cheap Headphones Out There!,"These are great. Sound is great, feel great on and are inexpensive. I gave mine to my son because he likes them better than the ones he has that cost much more. I just purchased another pair for myself. You cannot go wrong with these!"
1,not worth buying at all,This book is not worth buying at all. the author cleverly uses buzz words and selling tactics that try to make the book look good. I would shop for other SAP books. Dont waste your money on this one.
2,"Good Saw, No Complaints","I have had this Jig Saw for Almost 3 years now. I don't use it daily, but it does get more than its fair share of abuse. To this day, any problems with it have been due to my inexperience.One thing to keep in mind with any saw is having the right blade for the job. Ask your local home improvement expert which type of blade is right for your project. When I first used the saw, I was using an all purpose blade to do everything. After experimenting with a few different types on differend stock, I learned just how much difference they make.For me, this saw has worked great on everything from from countertops to crafts and beyond. It is more than powerful enough for a casual woodworker like myself."
1,abysmal,"did this get printed ? it is embarrassingly bad. admittedly i only read an excerpt in a magazine, bit that was enough. the film will probably be o.k. -working on the reverse wisdom that great novels make mediocre or bad films."
2,WOW! TONS better than the original Celtic Woman!,"I don't know what they did to change and improve this show so much, but whatever they did, it really, really, worked. The womyn were animated and the songs they sang were more to my liking than the Celtic Woman songs.This is just the opposite of Riverdance, the first edition was by far the best. This edition is so MUCH BETTER than the first one, that it's almost like watching a totally different group of womyn.Kudos to everyone who made all the improvements and keep it up! I'm probably going to buy this DVD!"
1,"Nope, not this one...","My 6 yo son has a VSmile for big kids, so, well, we bought a VSmile Baby for and an additional cartridge - no problems. My 16 months old daughter has no interest in it al all. The voices are very soft, and there is nothing to grab child's attention with, very plain colors and - believe it or not - it is very confusing to operate. Well, we did not spend too much time with the thing and now it is sitting on top of the bookshelf, and no one pays attention to it). Really-truly -a waste of money. She (my daughter) has a lot of fun with LeapFrog books, that were sent to my older son (6 yo) by his Grandma."
1,Horrible,"This book is awful. I had to force myself to finish it. The author spends an inordinate amount of time describing events and characters that actually have very little to do with the story. The main characters are not developed nearly enough. There was a lot of potential in the character of Jack Miller, but he was, ultimately a disappointment, as was the entire book. this book sucks. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Great shredder zero issues after several months of use,I've had this shredder for many many months now and it's performed perfectly. Zero issues. I'd highly recommend for daily at home shredding.
1,"Master of improv, but over and over?","Now Dana Carvey is widely respected for his comedy, at least in certain circles. Yes, he is a funny man. However, his humor maybe limited to sketches, although many thought that Wayne's World was funny (no comment.)This movie was about a more or less dumb kid, Carvey's character, of an Italian family that have been Master of Disguise's for years. However, the dad of Carvey's character wanted to protect his son, so he protected his son from the family's dangerous legacy. Yet when his parents are kidnapped Carvey, his grandfather, and a recently hired assitee have to help Carvey become his destiny.Now what this movie does is let Dana Carvey do a lot of impersonations. What this movie does not do is develop a good enough plot to keep those impersonations in a good flow. A few lines are funny like ""turtle, turtle"" but overall the humor is just lacking or mindless or both.Carvey could have done a really good movie with all of his talents, but this is not it."
2,Serious Prokofiev,"I have many recordings of the Prokofiev 1st and 5th symphonies yet I have never heard such serious, sober, and stern interpretations. It magnifies their power into something bigger than life. This is for better or worse Yoel Levi's doing. I think it is for the better since the music seems to make such a big impression on me. The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra shows that they are a major U.S. symphony orchestra near if not at the caliber of LAPO, NYPO, or the CSO. The Telarc recording is the weak link being only very good and not excellent or outstanding.In Telarc's own line-up I prefer this recording of the 5th to Paavo Jarvi's effort with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. This version with Levi is more sweeping and has more drama. In fact I probably endorse this Prokofiev 1st and 5th almost over anyone else's including Neeme Jarvi and Mstislav Rostropovich. It is that good.Highly recommended. Five Stars."
2,Getting into the dirt,"I have read all of Russo's novels and somehow missed this one until now. This exploration of Ned's roots rings true. The main character, Ned, a resourceful inteligent and, like most kids, honest boy. then teen and man, travels through the maze of confusion caused by a fragile mentally ill mother and a rugged, hard drinking WWII vet. I so appreciate Russo's grace in telling hard truths, in this case about the secret language and deals we make in the most intimate of our relationships. Many thanks for a great read."
1,just ok,"My baby likes to look at the objects but I think there are a few cons: it doesn't attach to my pack n play, you cannot turn it without music playing and the objects just turn but only really move when you hit them. It is cheap though."
2,Consider this book!!,"I knew nothing about applying makeup outside of what I had learned about applying the basics. I stumbled up this book and althought the price is a little high, I was sure this was the make-up book I had been waiting for. There are before and after pictures of all the girls and then a clear sheet to lay over the picture to tell you where/what color to apply to achieve the desired look in the image. Then he explains later at the end of each chapter what techniques to use.The most helpful book I have ever bought about applying make up.Good for the beginner and the advanced."
1,Review of the DVD (not the movie),Two hours of the miniseries missing without a trace. Is it an incomplete movie that you want to watch?
1,Caution before ordering check problems online,"I purchased Office 2007 and I was impressed by many features with Word and Excel. But be careful. The Outlook 2007 will bring your computer to a screeching halt. There is a function that synchronizes folders and it will lock your machine from 20 seconds to several minutes while it downloads e-mail and organizes them. The internet is full of very dissatisfied customers trying to solve this problem. I have been a very dedicated Microsoft customer but this has turned me. They have refused to address it and take a ""tough luck"" attitude. They will tell you your e-mail is too large but size does not seem to matter much. Use caution and do your homework before you spend your money on this."
1,It Died after 7 Months..,"The Pump died after 7 months. I had to run and buy a cheap heatsink/fan to replace it and it does the same job with 1/4 of the noise.After the pump died the coolant started to leak from the tubes. $150 to the trash. The quality of Coolit products are not up in standard with what you are used to buying computer components from EVGA, OCZ, Intel, Thermaltake. I did alot of reasearch before buying the product bc i didnt thrust a no-name manufacturer. I convinced myself after reading that dell was buying one of their products for its desktops.What a disapointment. Just spend the extra money on a better CPU."
2,Must have for Infants/Babies,"I had one of these for my daughter that is now 7 years old. I purchased another one for my son and it is the ""go to"" toy for home and being out and about."
2,Shweet!,"Poor Mulva has lived in fear of All Hallow's Eve ever since she was a little girl. Years ago, bad boy McLargehuge and his sidekick Takateru terrorized Mulva, and stole all of her Halloween candy. But this year, Mulva is out reclaim her long lost Halloween rite, and rake in the candy. Nothing can stand in her way....except for those annoying zombies!Join Mulva, Cassie, Mr. Bonejack, McLargehuge, Takateru, and Teenape himself as they battle to save Tromaville from the breakdancing horde of flesh-eating zombies!With special appearances by Debbie Rochon as Lady McPouchsweat, and Lloyd Kaufman as the Mayor."
1,Meh,"This item is NOT very sticky at all and only lasts a few strokes before you have to wash it off.. even if there's not a lot of lint/etc on the roller. It does what it says, and i guess not bad for the price, but i'd pay a little more to have more stickiness. I guess I was thinking it would be as sticky as one of those sticky rubber ""hand"" toys that stretch and grab paper and small things ... after they get dirty, you wash them and they are super sticky. not this thing. Oh well."
2,"Nice pendant, basic necklace","What you see is what you get. Original, nice looking pendant with pearls, with basic chain. My girl likes it."
1,Going through his hoops,"The Informers is a novel composing of fragmentary stories mixing up characters who are distinguished only by their conformity. They are all rich, all tan, all psychically rootless and morally deracinated, and all dysfunctional. They go through life as beneficiaries of capitalism, with no apparent purpose other than to enjoy pleasure in capsule form, take drugs, drink and discuss and 'enjoy' their material wealth. Ellis has done this theme before in his early 20s novels. Reading it is rather like the sensation when you are hungover or exhausted - you are successfully numbed into a world which is not entirely unpleasant, but you can't do anything constructive.American Psycho, which preceeded this work, was a masterpiece - justly one of the top novels anywhere of the past 20 years. But this novel lacks the arrowing Celine style satirical bite and bats forward cliches of the mindless super rich in capsule form."
1,Not a good book even for a beginner !!,"She just let you follow her codes line by line, again and again without explanation."
1,Another lame effort that simply falls flat,"Let me start off by saying, I really thought this game had potential but in the end it looks like just another half hearted attempt...Ok, let us begin with the good. You can play as any character from the series in any of the games! Good graphics. Create a fighter mode.The bad- Fighting is absolutely terrible, even worse then the previous games. Now it feels like one of the old Tekken rip offs from the arcades that was only a quarter to play. You can have your weapon out and use it the whole round. You can be knocked into hot lava and killed after 1 hit!There are no specific fatalities at all, the characters have lost their sense of identity. The value and presence of projectiles is next to nil, Shall I continue?Overall, this game looks and smells like a weak cash grab from a strugging franchise. You will be happier and still $40 wealthier playing UMK3 from the PS1!@"
1,Don't waste your money like I did,"If it weren't for Conspiracies, this game might be the worst game ever made. They're both pretty lousy."
2,I'm blessed because I know the world of Emily,"I've re-read this book so many times. It's like visiting an old friend.Wonderful to recognize.Loving every word.Emily is one of the very few persons, in books that I can say that I really know. She's like noone else.And I agree with one of the other reviewers, this isn't a book for just little girls. I belive that everyone could read them, no matter which age they are in.If you have read some of Montgomerys books this is surelly one you don't forget. Emily will allways be with me, just like Captain Jim in ""Anne's house of dreams"" and Walter in ""Rilla of Ingleside"". That is two books I also recommends,with all my heart.<...I'm glad that I have to other ones. They are so precious to me. So I would like to end this review as one of the other reviewers - I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT"
1,Check your options,"We tried both these and theseAdhesive Stainless V Towel Grabber set of 2 (Stainless Steel) (1""H x 3""W x 3""D)I'm giving two stars, because you get what you see and it's initially a great product. However...the 'Push towel grabber' came apart after 3 months. The plastic blue center fell out on both of them (I have it under my bathroom sink and use it occasionally). I have the 'V towel grabber' by the bathtub and put a wet wash cloth in it every night. The cloth is dry in the morning and the holder is in great shape. I do not recommend this 'Push towel grabber'.The 'V towel grabber' is cheaper also. If you must choose the push type, the red ones will save you four dollars."
2,The Best,"I am a perfume addict. It took me a while to find something that suited my personality as well as this perfume does. It's ultra classy, feminine, and quality."
2,Back to school for you.,Good movie. Don't give things bad reviews when it is you that needs improvement. Drag yourself back to school if you don't like it.
2,Agent Under Fire 007 review,Golden Eye & The World Is Not Enough are 2 of the best Bond video games out there. EA doesn't have a great reputation of putting out great James Bond games but they were some good games. In this game you have to go after this man named Nigel Bloch & This Woman named Malprave who are holding world leaders hostage. You team up with C I A Agent Zoey Nightshade. Now this game isn't based on any of the movies I don't know if it is based off any of the novels. You get 2 driving levels & the car has weapons. The weapon selection is good of course you get The Classic Walther PPK along with assassault weapons. Controls are fine the enemy movement is sporadic & it is a problem I wish they could've fixed that. The gadgets are there & are fun to use. So this is a great game it's not up to par with Golden Eye so if you decide to play it expect some minor flaws. Next I'll take a look at Nightfire.
1,Cookbook for me,"I'm so glad I purchased this book for myself because I took the word of a used book seller that it was in 'Like New' condition. Big mistake. The whole spine was broken away from the book, and it was shipped in a PAPER BAG. Don't most people ship in a carton??? Lesson learned. I repaired it, but will never order a used book again. Martha Schulz"
2,Almost Perfect!,"This camera takes good video quality and good picture quality (about 1MP). I bought this camera to possibly be a good all-in-one camera, pictures and video. The 30GB holds more than I need and it is easy to transfer to a Computer. My only problem at all with this camera is that it does not have a flash. I believe the Sony SR200 and SR300 have a flash. So, it turns out that for taking pictures indoors it is still better for me to use my other sony Camera. Other than that this camera fits all my needs and I think it actually works out better that I use this camera for video and the other for pics."
1,Bad experience,The camera was ok but a year later it stopped working out of nowhere.We were told that we would have to pay $250 approximately in order for canon to repeat it.So of course we bought a different camera.
1,Disappointed,"This is a terribly disappointing video. I was expecting to see some incredible dancing. Instead, what we have throughout this recording, are close-ups of head and shoulders and a few seconds of group/long shots. I actually started counting the seconds a camera held a position and the longest length of time was 8 seconds - and that's including the lyrical passages. The group is passionate and attractive. The costumes and sets are terrific. If only the cameras could stay still. I'm sure this performance was thrilling in the theater. Major dissapointment."
2,Must buy for new parents!,This is the best CD of lullabyes. A must have for new parents. Makes a wonderful gift.
1,The Mother's Tongue,"I thoroughly enjoyed the lyrical and gorgeous poems. All are sweet and meaningful, and beautifully, thoughtfully written."
2,Placido Domingo: A Love Until The End Of Time,If you want to relax to one of the greatest voices of all time singing love ballads then this is the one for you. His version of Autumn Leaves is the best I have ever heard. I would recommend this one to anyone - even if you don't care for classical you will enjoy this one.
1,not really that good,"Alot of people want and like to say this album/band are really good, but the truth is, it/they are not really that good. It is a very bland album. Basically a modern version of The Beatles entire catalogue, only without all the genius that those songwriters had. People really need to stop saying albums are good just because the ""style"" is good. This songwriting is just not that good. It's an album just like all the other albums it is comparable to, by the bands they are comparable to. Albums by the shins, and apples in stereo: boring albums that sound sort of like modern kids influenced by a mix of The Beatles and Punk Rock, with a couple good pop songs somewhere on the record. Much, much better pop and rock records have been made over the last 40 years that people should by before ever buying anything like this. sorry."
1,Wrong Coloring,"The watch is nice, it may be a little small for my boyfriend's preference but I ended up returning the item because the color was so different from what was actually featured online. I order gunship expecting a dull gray or black tint watch but the watch that arrived was blue. It wasn't quite navy blue either, a little lighter then navy. I returned the watch today."
2,Deluxe Reverb Cover,What to say? It does it's job... covers my amp and protects it from dust and spills. I think that about covers it.
2,Cute,"Sturdy product, I ordered for my grandson who is 10 months old and he loves it. was a great purchase."
2,Kora Magic!,"Kora music is a genre which i really enjoy and who better to listen than the J.J.Cale of Mali (If Farka Toure can be the Muddy Waters of Mali) Toumani Diabate'. Chancing upon this disc which combines the traditional music of Mali , played on the Kora with elements of Jazz/ Blues, i had high expectations for this one. I was not let down. This music represents some of the most delightful sounds on the planet. There's a liveliness and joyousness, that keeps you mesmerized.If you have never heard of Kora music, you must listen to this one, you owe it to your yourself, the only thing i can think of that is better than listening to this CD, is seeing the man play this live. Its incredible, soothing, clear blue skies music, a time in your life when life was much much better and happy.recommend strongly. 5 Stars"
1,enough already ...,"In ""Little Games"" Jimmy Page plays some of the best guitar heard in any Yardbirds lineup, but the Mono tapes Sundazed used are so saturated with distortion the album is unlistenable. It's less expensive than the 2007 (Stereo) Japanese reissue, and that's all it has going for it.I'm a Sundazed fan, but sometimes they blow it. Maybe it's time to put a period to the era of Dinosaur Rock and let albums like ""Little Games"" go. The 2007 Japanese reissue is probably the best this album will ever sound. Sundazed's reissue is a waste of money."
2,Perfect Order,The product came on time and way faster than expected. The product is working perfectly and is very convenient to use compared to buying multiple batteries a month.
1,ONLY VOL 1!,If you're looking for last names from Abbot - Cuttriss it's a great book... but it is only Volume one of a set!!! Be aware!
1,This Is Supposed to be DOOM?,"The third in the series of DOOM novels, this one is, by my standards, the worst. It's very slow, doesn't have much action, and really has nothing to do with DOOM. I wouldn't suggest you read this book, but, if you've read the second and third novels in the series, and you want to know what happens next, you might as well read it to get you up to speed for when you read #4. Otherwise, check out book #1 or #2 instead. That's my two cents."
1,The incredible shrinking changing pad cover,"Though the dimensions were correct for my pad, after I washed this cover it was obviously too small. My pad buckles and will not lay flat. Part of the problem seems to be the elastic in the cover, which is tougher than a fitted sheet. In order for any diaper pad to lay flat with this cover, it would have to have a solid wooden or plastic frame."
1,Hoped for Glory,"I had high hopes for this release. I've been a long time fan of Heart and think Ann has one of the greatest female voices in rock. The album doesn't rock out and show her full voice. It would also have been nice to hear her own songs instead of all those covers. I would skip this and wait for a new Heart album. Be careful, listen to the clips before you purchase it."
1,"An interesting book, if he had not made so much of it up.","This book could have been a great insight intothe current administration. UnfortunatelyMr. Reich invented several passages out of thin air. It was recently reported on NPR that several journalists had reviewed the transcripts of press conferences that are quoted in this book. When reviewed they could not locate any of the witty and insightful comments Mr. Reich claims to have made. When asked about these mistakes he claimed that ""all truth is subjective"" and that these were his memories, not a reporter's accounting. It sounds like the fact that he was a FOB has allowed Bill Clinton's view of honesty to rub off on Mr. Reich."
1,The Overrated Virtue of Integrity,"Integrity...Ani...Didn't these words used to go together? Or am I confused? Isn't Ani the blockbuster artist who did Not a Pretty Girl and Dilate? The one who attacks the world with some of the sharpest barbs ever? Then what the heck is this? Aside from a collection of shallow, self-obsessed songs lacking in lyrical content, I mean.Give me Living In Clip any day."
2,Wonderful book.,I really can't put how great this book is into words. Just read it and trust me. You will not be disappointed!!
2,I always have it with me.,"It felt heavy. It took a moment to understand the screwdriver bits, and that the Phillips head worked.But it's been on my belt since I bought it, and it's been very handy: perhaps the only thing it's missing is a pair of scissors. When it's not there, I find myself reaching for it anyway.I do recommend that you get the leather sheath for it: the nylon sheath is good, but the leather one handles the knife better."
2,Don Fardon - 'Indian Reservation / I've Paid My Dues' (Edsel),"As fate would have it, I actually remember this British Invasion one-hit wonder. This is a rather nice 2-fer-1 CD import. First you get his 'Indian Reservation' ('68) effort and that lp's follow-up 'I've Paid My Dues' ('70) - see my review. Songs off the first record that more than make the grade are Fardon's cover of the Paul Revere & The Raiders hit - this disc's title track ""Indian Reservation"", ""How Do You Break A Broken Heart"", the toe-tapping ""Captain Man"", ""Sally Goes Around The Moon"", his tribute to Joe Cocker with ""The Letter"" and ""I Need Somebody"". Essential listening."
1,Mixed emotions,"As soon as I saw the trailer, I couldnt wait to find the book. I was just about ready to order in when I had gone to visit my mother and found it in the trash. She said my sister had read it and immediately tossed it. I couldnt resist and went ahead and delved into it. Even though it was so predictable and stupid at times, I couldnt put it down and read it in 2 days. It read just like a movie (gratuitous sex scenes and all). Dumb dumb dumb. But on the other hand, I cant wait to see the movie."
2,This album is one of the best that I have ever heard!,"When I first heard it, I had no clue what to expect. But once I listened to it, I realized just how awesome Christian music can be. Now it's practically all that I ever listen to."
1,Play on Words,"Both the title and the conclusion are very clever. However, that is about all there is to this book. The author is able to play with words. I commend him for being able to find words that do not use the banned letters. With very shallow characters and a banal plot, even the word play becomes tedious about half way through the book. Perhaps Reader's Digest could condense it by two-thirds and use it in their sample give aways. I plan to donate my copy to the local library."
1,I won't take a chance on these even with amazon prime,"Due to the many review about the deterioration in quality and sizing I see no reason to purchase these shoes, even though years ago I had several reebok shoes I really liked. Just placed an order for LA Gear on shoes.com"
2,Works fine with Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 and Dell Dimension E510 and HP nc6000 laptop,I think the previous reviewer has a very specific issue that is not related to all hardware. This product has worked well with my hardware (as I suspect it does for most other folks). It's a great solution if you have two PCs with dual monitors.
1,Problems,"I am using a high absorbent litter in the box; however, when I rolled the box to the right to clean, urine leaked out onto my floor. I'm not sure how it happened and I don't recall seeing other reviews about this problem, but that has been my experience. I think the best option for me is to go back to using a standard enclosed litter box and continue to scoop the clumps out with the scooper."
1,Waste of money,"I should have listen to the other reviews. It was heavier than expected. It didn't really work very well. My husband had purchased some 100% cotton shirts for a trip overseas. As we prefer B&Bs, I wasn't sure if they would have an iron. It didn't work well. Not heavy enough to get out wrinkles and the steamer is a joke. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Could Be Better,"This author didn't make much of a story out of the information she had. She might have done better if she created some interest. Mainly she copied the police interviews, and court information. I would like to see someone else try their hand at this subject. It is a story worth telling, with more feeling."
1,Bleh.,"Jane Hudson, the protagonist of this overwrought and under-written book, is a supposedly bright woman who, nevertheless, can't seem to put two and two together. The plot is intricate, but only in the way a train wreck is intricate.The story depends heavily on a series of unlikely omissions and on Jane's apparent inability to recognize... well, just about anybody, ever.Descriptions are sparse and clumsy and, in most cases, act as little more than an excuse for awkward foreshadowing, hastily introducing a character trait or prop just in time for it to be used, a few pages later, to advance the increasingly unlikely plot.A barely passable mystery, all in all, but not worthy of the comparisons it has drawn with Donna Tartt's far superior _Secret History._"
2,"You people are pathetic(At least, some of you)","First off, I don't have a DS, but i'm thinking about getting one. I'm just writing this review because YOU PEOPLE ARE MAKING ME SO MAD I WANT TO RIP MY HAIR OUT!! There, I said it. I'm not a fanboy. Sony is awesome, I love my PS2, and Nintendo is awesome. I love my Gamecube and my Gameboy SP.Now, the DS looks like it could have a lot of potential with it's dual screens and touch pad. And, it just dropped down $20. It's got pretty good graphics, innovation, and will soon have Wi-fi. How can you go wrong?The PSP looks like it has a lot of potential, too. I would recommend the DS over the PSP if you like to play games on your handhelds and you have a PS2 or Xbox, or if you just don't want those games. I would recommend the PSP over the DS if you don't have a PS2, since most of it's games are on PS2. But, I would give the slight nudge to the DS. Did you that? SLIGHT nudge!"
2,"Underrated, swinging Billy May and Sinatra...","May and Sinatra's 'Come Fly with Me' is the best known of their collaborations, but 'Swing Along with Me' (or 'Sinatra Swings', if you read the CD spine) has plenty of firepower for listeners who like their Sinatra hot. May had a reputation for off-the-wall arrangements, and 'Swing Along' is no exception.'Curse of an Aching Heart' is relentless, but with great lyrics. 'Granada' is one of the loudest things they ever recorded, and a lot of fun, while 'Moonlight on the Ganges' brings a lot of brass and a huge gong at the end. 'You're Noboby Til Somebody Loves You' is wonderful.The confusingly similar title (probably the 5th or 6th 'Swingin' Sinatra album) does not help this album, and the liner notes on the original CD issue are the skimpiest anywhere, but a few Sinatraphiles consider this more enjoyable than the 'Come Fly with Me' album -- high praise indeed."
2,The best collection of trivia about the English language.,"Written in an engagingly familiar way, but full of informative and interesting facts about the complexities of English. Essential for anyone who has an innate curiosity interest about the origins of the way much of the world's population speaks and writes"
1,"I wanted to love it, really I did...","Having abandoned this novel only half-read years ago, I went back to it hoping that maturity and experience might make a difference in my view of the work. Again I found myself plodding through, at least finishing it this time, but still left unimpressed. Sorry. I tried."
1,Short and weak rehash of Jimmy's earlier work,"This CD contains only four tracks, re-recordings of some of his earlier work. The new versions are longer than the originals, and have more complex arrangements, but they are a bit too smooth and mellow to be engaging. Further, the sound quality is dissapointing. There is very noticable hiss, and the treble sounds distored. It is rare indeed to hear a modern musical recording that sounds so poor."
1,Heh,"This band just isn't the same without John Nolan...The only song that stuck with me on this album was the last one, though Bonus Mosh Pit Pt.2 almost reminded me of what they used to be. The rest of the songs on the CD fall under pop-punk, not well-thought out emo.Save your money if you already have the first CD.p.s: the person in the spotlight review was ""surprised"" by the fact there was a slow song on this album. makes you wonder if they even listened to the first CD...Ghost Man On Third?"
2,Nice book,"I disagree with the negative rating that was given by Colin Fox. In my view the book is a well-written introduction to a lot of mathematical terms used in theoretical works on inverse problems. Although the methods may be outdated a little, the mathematical basis of the methods seems to be very good and the examples are easy to understand. The book is focussed on continuous eigenvalue, potential and scattering problems. For discrete inverse problems it is probably wiser to consider a different book. This book helped me to understand the work of mathematicians such as Colton and Kress better. Since I do not have a very mathematical background, I'm curious what theoretical mathematicians say about it."
1,,"I struggled to get through this book. It was dreadfully boring, though persevered and finished the book, can`t say it was enjoyable."
1,Awful in a bad way,"I do love a good wiener fart humor movie...but this is NOT it. Predictable, lame, unoriginal, boring. Anna Faris and everyone else in this film should be embarrassed. Sacha could have made this a smart, witty or dark humored flick and still included the shot of a fake big-bushed weenie coming at you. It's got no heart, is dumbed down, and is a waste of time production. I felt small for watching it."
2,Good,Solid frame work has good insulation and holds all the beer I can drink in one setting:-)Definately like the color!!
2,The Mother Road,I plan on buying a Corvette and hitting the road as soon as possible. After watching these shows I have a serious case of wonderlust.
1,Forget It!!!,Purchased camera and was excited about those who have succesfully installed and used. I spent 5 1/2 hours trying to install and I consider myself tech savvy. I Went through all tech support and still nothing. It is going back to the store. I was using Windows ME and have never had any trouble with ME. The Biggest problem I had was the step during installation where it detects the camera. Never Happened! Keeps locking and giving me a solid blue screen after restart.
1,Unpredictable,"My main problem with this camera is that the picture quality is very unpredictable. Some pictures come out perfectly clear, while others are extremely blurry. I've found that the pictures without needing a flash have better clarity. My hand is very steady, so I know it's not a matter of moving during the shot. My previous camera, which was a different brand, never had these problems. I would not recommend this camera and am currently shopping for a different one."
2,Great mousepad!,"This is my second Belkin gel mouse pad. I started using the first on back in 1998 and it's been great, but it finally started wearing out (10 years of daily use is not too bad!) I had no doubt about what kind to get this time. I have very sensitive skin and a lot of pads are too rough. I love the silky feel of this one. The wrist rest molds to the shape of your wrist and hand for a custom fit. I love it!"
2,Flowers of War,I found this movie very entertaining yet filled with facts that gave a strong touch of reality to the movie.The characters played by the ladies of the night and the schoolgirls were excellent - natural actresses. It was a moving and gripping movie.
1,I think the product is good ... but!,"After ordering the Addonics pocket CD-ROM from this electronics fender it came in reasonable time. But my laptop would not work with it. I think the problem was with my lap top and not the CD-ROM. So I never had a chance to use it. I contacted the fender and they were very helpful and told me that I could return it and provided all of the help I needed to return the device. The only problem, my account has not yet been credited three weeks after returning it."
2,Quick delivery - perfect condition,"It was a gift to my 82 year old father and he said it was just ""Jim Dandy""."
2,Great,An excellent little edge maintenance stone. Comes in a protective plastic case with a keyring. Perfect for putting in survival type kits and knife sheaths. I'd recommend it for such purposes to anyone.
1,Biggest disappoinment in film in a decade...,"I never thought a film about bomb disposal could be as stunningly slow, uninteresting and uninformative as this piece of garbage. it also manages to kill the two best actors it has within minutes of them appearing. Jeremy Renner is a hack who should never have been nominated in the 1st place. this film is a joke on America by a woman who up until recently has made some really good (BLUE STEEL, NEAR DARK) to excellent (STRANGE DAYS) films. she shouldn't have listened to her ex James Cameron on this one."
2,Glamorise Bra,"Glamorise Women's Wonderwire Front Close Stretch Lace Bra #9245Love it! Read some of the reviews and can't add much. Like another lady, my fav was discontinued and was very happy to stumble on this one (been looking for years). Wish it wasn't quite so sheer, wish it didn't have the dart on the cup. BUT it's the MOST comfortable bra ever. Unfortunately though, not right for everything. Shame . . I did mention comfortable!Going to order another right now!"
2,Great Read,I never thought about reading a religious fiction book before. To my surprise I found myself staying up just to get to the next chapter. Great read for everyone.
1,Lounge Singer vs. Marley? The Perfect Storm,For some reason I had this CD kicking around in my house and I had the misfortune to listen to it. This has to be absolutely one of the worst albums I have ever heard ... a lounge singer warbling over a muzak-like reggae beat. It is almost a joke. Thank goodness I lost the front booklet to the CD so I'll have an easier time disposing of it in the trash.
2,Was a gift,"This was a gift for a high school student, recommended by her AP teacher. She loves history, and absorbed every word of this book, as evidenced by her constant references to it. I can't profess as to whether I approve of it's contents, as I didn't read it."
2,great debut,Bring Me to Life is awesome and I am glad it may have gotten 12 Stones on the map as well. This whole album is greast and one of the few out there you can put in your CD player and let go.
1,dexter let down,The makers of this dvd set give away the ending in the previews. The suspence is gone before the show starts. I am VERY dissapointed in the production of this! I have bought every season until now. I won't be buying the next one.
1,Craptastic!,"Shame on those of you who pay money for this tripe and allow for shallow, talentless drones to continue to make a living in entertainment while true artists starve. Ashlee Simspson doesn't deserve any of what she has. She needs to be blackballed for the trickery and fraud she is guilty of. She must be removed from radio and television. She is so hated now that she even had to shut down the message board on her own website. Should she play a town near you, please loudly protest outside and do your part to shut her down."
1,DON'T WATCH THAT MOVIE,This movie is one of the worst and terribley discusting horror movie I have ever seen. one of the most important turnoffs of the movie is that it was dubbed.I had to forward many of the boring and jucier scene( as the cover of the video proudly announced). and the idea of every one turning into demons made the story so boring.This movie is not worth any penny that I spent on it. Movie maker should not underestimate the audiance into making such movies in the future.
2,great product,"I've been using this product for years. It relieves the symptoms of menopause almost immediately, and you feel like a normal person again, instead of someone experiencing their own tropical vacation."
2,Best buy - Year after year,"I have bought Jeanne Carley's ferret calendar every year since its inception. I find them original, creative and a lot of fun to look at. I buy a minimum of 12 a year to give as gifts to friends and family. We all wait impatiently for the new ones to come out.Diane BodofskyLast Chance Ferret Rescue"
1,And I'm even a fan,"This was a brilliant Film. You might say the comic version of ""WAR and PEACE"". The Blu-Ray looks fantastic no SD shots slipped into the final production 100% picture perfect. So why one star you ask? The sound levels for the film are all over the place. One min the ""action"" is loud and intense. The next min you can't hear a word the actors are saying? My PS3 and receiver has a sound sink and filtration microchip set included and It didn't do squat! I SPENT 3HRS turning the volume up for the speaking parts and way down for the action sequences. This completely ruined the relaxing enjoyment of what movie watching is all about. This was a movie I was really excited about buying for my blu-ray collection, oh well now that got shot all to hell! Same with the newest version of BATMAN dark night. What in the hell is up with the weirdo crappy sound in the newer movies? Final verdict rent um before you buy um!"
1,worst book ever written,"I can't believe how bad this book is. I'm speechless. Horrible writing, story filled with cliches."
1,FOR DUMMIES!,"What happened? Dummies books used to be good. Or have I just read to many, and the same dull humor, puns is just starting to get to me. This book weighs in pretty hefty, and just did not seem like a good study guide for the exam. Perhaps, this series should have just stuck to the basics. I reccomend you look elsewhere for an i-net plus book. Most are probably easy reads anyhow and you might learn some more along the way. Good luck."
2,I love this!,I love this product. So easy to use and clean. Definitely worth the money. I will be buying this as gifts for my friends.
1,ok-not what expected,"this item was not what was expected, searched for Torx Sockets and got this, works, but not what was wanted"
2,Arrived in perfect condition,"To allay any concerns based on comments of damage during shipment, I did receive the map in perfect condition yesterday. It was shipped using Fedex in a huge rectangular box measuring approximately 5' x 3', placed diagonally in the box with plenty of packing. The map itself is wonderful - large enough to give great detail without having to use a magnifying glass."
1,It doesn't work!,"Bought this cute pearl colored camera with much excitement and was highly disappointed that no matter how gently I pulled its rip cord, my film would simply not advance! I looked carefully inside and it really seems to be a design flaw. The teeth that feed the film sprockets just do not feed it effectively! Don't waste your money!"
1,What a darn shame...,"Sadly, a fantastic movie has been reduced to a cheap and pitiful DVD. The sound quality is horrible. The picture quality is worst then a high-end VCR. Stay away from buying this cheap DVD folks. It's a pathetic attempt.This was and is a very good interesting movie. Great plot, outstanding actors. It deserves better."
1,If you are really into Nihon cooking don't get this book!!,"If you have any knowledge of Japanese cooking then you are already beyond this book.It is extremely basic.But the pictures are nicer than your usual japanese cook book and there are one or two good recipes, but this almost seems like a coffee table book in a travel guide form factor.I don't think I will get any other lonely planet world food books"
1,I can't follow any unwise advise,I have purchased this book together with Babywise sleep book from couple of my friends' recommendation and have to say I am very much disappointed with books. Both books are focused on training a baby based on idea that Baby can act and think like adult and near adult phisican & mental capability.I am not condemming this book to be worst book ever as some people do.. but would like to caution parents and let them know it is only one person's opinion and suggesion.
2,"Magnificent,Superb,Great","The book is so beautifully written that it will make you read it again and again.It takes you back to the renaissance.It talks about Michelangelo's agonies & ecstasies.His troubled times with the popes.His life under the patronage of Lorenzo de Medici.The troubles he had making his masterpieces,such as,the Sistine ceiling,David,the dome of St.Peters.It also talks about his life love,the plagues,the wars,the arts and the artists of his time.Over all this book Fanstastic & out of this world.After reading this you would want to read Stone's other books."
1,Not what I expected.,Did not care for this album. The melody to some of these songs is not what I expected to hear. Kinda left me flat.
1,WHAT SOME PEOPLE WILL DO FOR MONEY,WHY O WHY O WHY ?THEY HAVE RUINED THE WHOLE SERIES NOW ! ! ! !I EMPLORE YOU NOT TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD !:( :( :( :(ONE WORD - JOBBIES
2,Almost too pretty to use.,"My Sister received this as a gift and said she was hesitant to use it. It's just too pretty to use every day, but when I gave her the special tea she changed her mind. This cup is perfect for those very special,flavored loose teas that make an excellent dessert cup of tea."
1,Wow! This is really abominably bad!,"I simply am aghast at how horribly bad this movie is. The acting is flat, lifeless and it is obvious the actors are merely going through the motions. The special effects are laughable. Attempts at suspense are simply ludicrous and the whole plot is simply unbelievable. You should watch this only if someone pays you."
2,If you like Nine Inch Nails to meet Tool....,"This is the first Godhead CD I bought, I think it's awesome. I really would recommend it if you like ""Nine Inch Nails"" and possibly ""Tool"" or ""Perfect Circle"". It certainly has those types of flavors in the songs."
1,Disappointed,"After reading the high praise for this book I was disappointed. The writing is fair and while the story line works for the first part of the book one soon realizes that many plot points are really for an upcoming book. As this was a first novel by this author I thought that it would stand on it's own but ***SPOILER*** when I got to the end I was right in my suspicion that this was all set up for a second book. I love series and don't have a problem with plot points scattered as seeds for upcoming works but usually those books stand on their own and have a conclusion on their own. After the first part (noted as such), it's all set up for the sequel. When I don't race to finish a book but feel that ""I might as well since I'm half way through"" it's not a good sign."
1,Good for starting out,These gloves came with my bag and they are more than comfortable for when I was first getting used to it.I'm giving it 3 stars for now because something about the internal material rubbed my knuckles the wrong way and since I don't want to stop working out I have a near dime sized perpetual scab on my pinky knuckles.I'm going to purchase another pair at which point I'll come back and change my review relative to those.Edit: So I'm downgrading to a two because these gloves would not stop scabbing my knuckles and once I went at the bag for over an hour I took off the gloves to find my hands were complete fubar. They may have been a size too large but the material inside is what I'd say is to blame.
2,the best 80's compilation yet,The Sedated in the 80's series truly captures the spirit of the era for me. It sends me back to the nights at CBGB's or Max's Kansas City in New York when I intentionally sat in front of the speakers so I could feel my internal organs shake (by the way...it didn't damage my hearing...your mother was wrong!).
1,Don't waste your money,There is nothing in this book that you can not find by reading the Google AdSense FAQ.
2,Happy with the ICONs.,"I bought these for my car back in November, and so far, so good. Installation was easy. Believe me. If I can do it, you can too! I have previously purchased the Rain-X Latitudes for my other car the previous month, and I prefer these over the Rain-X blades."
2,Spectacular Happiness,"Readers who admire the elegant prose and telling insight into the human condition of Listening to Prozac will want to read Peter Kramer's novel, Spectacular Happiness, scheduled for publication in July 2001."
2,unbelievable,"if there were more stars, i would give more out. this album blew me away. if you eminem's first two albums were good, wait till you hear this one. those look weak in comparison to this album. rolling stone hit the nail on the head with this one. this album is the best rap-rock album in history. hands down the best of the year. and so far there has been a lot of great albums. 2002 is the return of music. with black rebel motorcycle club, the strokes, doves, oasis, eminem, so on and so on, the coporate [junk] that we have been hearing will start to get erased. it starts with this phenominal album. do yourself a favor and pick this bad boy up."
1,Oh please!,"A movie that takes itself too seriously with unintended laugh out loud humor is bound to fail. Such is the case with this worthless movie that in two words is aptly described, namely, IT STINKS. Sharon Stone doesn't have any charisma not that if she did it would save this train wreck of a film. Why bother writing a review for this film. I just wasted 2 minutes doing that."
1,TERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIBLE,"I love Peter, in fact I think his 78 solo album is the best one, and also like ""Let me rock you"" and ""Out of control"" quite a lot. Peter was involved in many of my very favorite KISS songs ever (""Dirty livin'"", ""Baby Driver""...)But this album is PLAIN AWFUL, starting with a cover that Peter designed himself, that sucks big time. The songs sound pretty much the same, have no power, no chorus to remember, no nothing. The lyrics are laughable, And the song about Ace? Probably Ace won't ever talk to him after this one!!!I have given it a second (and a 3rd, and a 4th...) try and, well, there's something here, and there, some hooks, some melodies... but the problem is that not very many people will be as patient as me giving it so many chances."
1,Weak,"My biggest complaint about this DVD is there is virtually no warm-up and an insufficient cool down. In addition, although you will break a sweat, the movements are very jerky, and at times very fast paced, although for short intervals. Its a fast workout right out of the box -- there is nothing to build up to. And, I could see how someone could seriously hurt themselves using this DVD by trying to keep up. The 10 minute abs is o.k. Another overall comment I have is she does not ease into things and explain them very well. I'm sure there must be better out there -- but this is not it. I doubt I'll use it again."
1,cotton top full mattress pad,"I ordered and received a mattress pad manufactured by Louiseville Bedding Co. This product is so inferior that I cannot believe that Amazon.com promotes the sale of it under their super saver shipping program. Considering that I can buy the same product at Walmart for around $18 but paid $30 from Amazon.com, I cannot help but feel that Amazon.com is charging for the shipping and perpetuating fraud. The pad shrank so bad that I am unable to get it onto the bed. Considering that the standard sizing for a full bed is 54X75 and this pad was 53X75 it started out smaller. I do not feel that it is fair to expect me to pay money to ship this back to Amazon.com and therefore I expect Amazon.com to send me a prepaid shipping label. Then when Amazon.com receives the pad I expect to get a full refund on my charge account."
2,Love it!,"After lots of searching for a replacement for our pool basketball set, we decided on this one! It was s and so easy to assemble that my 12 year old did it with just a little help. VERY sturdy and no metal parts on the bottom of the set to rust onto my pool deck. Love the huge backboard and net! Great set that will hopefully last a long time for my boys!"
1,You get what you pay for,"The phrase you get what you pay for is very appropriate when it comes to this product. While it holds papers okay. It frequently falls apart and is flimsy. It does not hold books well, the clip on top does little to nothing to hold things in place, and it only has one true place in which to keep it set in place as the other setting have no secure slot to prevent to small slates from sliding out. I would recommend spending extra to get a decent one if you really use it a lot."
2,Wonderful book,"I too found this book hugely interesting and well-written. It really shaped my whole understanding of the East Coast deciduous forest--where it came from and its ecology and connections with forests elsewhere in the world. I only wish there was some way a new edition could be produced to take into account any further developoments in the understanding of plate tectonics, the effects of warming and sprawl, etc., that would be relevant. But it is an extraordinary book and not out of date in any important way with what it says, despite being forty years old. Anyone with an appreciation of the North American forest MUST read it."
2,It's carbon,"I like this carbon, but what can you say? It does its job, and it is carbon. I went with it because I have always had good experiences with Seachem products, and I have yet to be disappointed."
2,yaktrax,"These are very handy to have, especially in the winter. My sister and brother in law really appreciate these. Their old yak trax were worn out, so I HAD to get these!!!"
2,sunshine1986,"Love this show, this season not as funny as previous seasons but still worth it to watch. Will rent season 6 next."
1,Warning : Nice Bag - but it's not 1 pound as described.,"I ordered this bag to carry my pet onboard an aircraft, When I read the description I assumed it was Ultra-Light, A one pound bag.... After I got the bag I weighed it at the airport and discovered its approx. 4 pounds! - Again it's a great bag, But the Airline companies have weight restrictions. - Be warned if your pet is close to the weight limit this may not be the right bag for you."
1,What a piece of garbage,A halfway-decent plot concept ruined by Mr. Frey. This book is plagued by bad storytelling and poor research. Numerous factual errors about the JFK assassination and the US intelligence community force the reader to questions Frey's credibility as a writer ... he probably cranked out this piece of garbage in a weekend.
1,"Had big hopes for, but still hoping...","I am currently reading this book, and already struggling to get through it. I had also read all of the reviews, and was excited to begin reading. However, halfway through and I am already wondering how long it will take me to finish it. The beginning had promise, with the underlying currents in Mike and Carrie's relationship, the hot-headed best friends Rooster and Jaime, but I feel like the book is now wandering. All of the sudden Carrie is in New York hooking up with someone she met once in Madison. Huh? I am sure I will end up finishing this book, but I don't anticipate it being an outstanding reading experience."
1,YUK,"I bought this because my dog pulls all the time and a trainer had suggested a nose type collar. My arm hurts all the time from her constant pulling and she has a few times almost made me fall. This collar would not fit her right with no amount of adjustment, it put pressure on her eyes. I don't know if my german shorthair's eyes are placed any differently than any other dog but the strap would not stay down on her nose at all. I do not want to do any damage to her so I returned the collar.Note-- I do not see how playing tug of war would make a dog walk on a leash properly. (a poster from above) I have tried using treats, voice commands, etc and nothing works to control her pulling."
1,So glad I tried this at a party first!,"First of all, the chocolate isn't hot, nor is it even warm...it's more like cool. I was expecting hot.Second, the reviews that talk about all the vegetable oil being added are correct. And as the party went on, more oil had to be added. Oil added to chocolate chips doesn't taste very good.I would MUCH rather have real fondue that's hot and chocolatey! That way you can add liquors or other flavors, experiment with different chocolates, etc.With the Fondue Fountain, by the time guests returned to their seats, several commented that the chocolate had ""hardened"" from all the oil added. Yuck.Also, be prepared for the size. Ask yourself, ""Where am I going to store this big box?""Just my honest opinions. I'm sticking with the real fondue."
2,"Great RAM, Great Price, Lighting Fast",Just upgraded from 2G to 4G running Windows 7 32-bit. Lighting fast great RAM!!
1,Peter Criss Out of Control for sure,I'm a huge Kiss fan and I appreciate when an artist stretches their wings but this is a horrible effort. I will always share a great repsect for Peter but stick to what you do best. Hire a great rock and roll band and create a new alternative version of Kiss. Style is what gave Kiss the initial edge plus their music rocks!! Peter look into creating a similar vibe! Best to you Peter!!
1,"Yikes, that was a lot of money for a lot of frustration","I also had trouble installing the software. Finally downloaded it (...). Then, once we got it working, the module ate up the batteries in less than 1/2 a day. When we take the module out, the visor has plenty of juice. But, when the module is plugged in, I og messages that I didn't have enough battery to take a picture. Very frustrating - and very expensive!"
1,Unless you're Scottish-YOI!,"Aside from the difficulty in understanding the Scottish dialogue, and what turns out to be a slightly forgettable, muddled plot, the performances are what carry this movie forward. Jonny Lee Miller, as always, is incredible. Though he's lost some of his thin faced freshness, he still has an appeal that remains universal. He and his co-stars do an admirable job with less than great material, but in the end (and at the end) what good's a movie unless you're kept interested. An unexpected, fairly dumb ending. 2 outta 5."
1,got really hot!,"I bought this because the box said ""cool exterior"" I was looking for cool exterior toaster oven cuz I have lil child at home, for safty reason. But it gets really hot outside. Side of toaster was OK but the other parts got really really hot so I refund it. If it gets this hot, nothing difference other cheap stuff to me. this is too expencive I thought."
1,RainBLOWs,"I've listened and enjoyed Mariah since I was a Freshman in high school. I've loved everyone of her albums except this one... Trashy remixes, scratchy voice... this album does no justice to herself or to her fans. I took this cd back the same day I bought it. Though she did an okay remake of Phil Colins song, I thought the rest of the cd bombed! Mariah, if you read this... girl YOU CAN DO BETTER!"
1,Waste of time,Does one really need to ANALYZE one's friends? Either friendships work out or they don't...it's a cycle as old as time.
2,Easy to Clean,"We had bought a potty chair when our son turned 2, when he started using it a few months later I was greatly disappointed, I spent so much time trying to keep it clean, it had lots of little cracks and crevices and it was not really big enough. After reading reviews on this potty I decided to buy it. ..boy am I glad I did, this potty is larger than most of the ones I have seen and it is so easy to keep clean. My son is not a large 2 year old and he had trouble with the one we originally bought. We have no more messes on the floor and this simple two piece design makes keeping it cleaned a breeze."
2,break out cd!,"This is one of the best CDs from Yellowcard. After debuting in 2001, they've finally reached stardom with Ocean Avenue. Branching out from the normal punk sound...Yellowcard uniques themselves from the masses with Sean Mackin on the violin. This cd has a wide variety of music that every punk fan would enjoy. <3"
2,Great summer read,"A perfect summer/beach book! My first by this author and I loved it. I couldn't wait to see how it ended yet didn't want it to end. I loved the swans!!!! Lovely book to get lost in.I would have liked alittle more closure in the ending.Highly recommended!"""
2,Mindi is the next jazz superstar,"It Just Happens That Way is a terrific CD. For a first time effort, Mindi has struck gold. Every track is fantastic. She plays the sax with plenty of emotion and has a great voice to compliment the tracks. If this CD is any indication, Mindi is going to be a superstar. I've seen her live show and she was great."
1,Fully Loaded is my favorite ppv event of the year.,"Fully Loaded was the marveles ppvof the year.the rock vs chris beniot was a adventure extravagenza of the year.LAST MAN STANDING hhh vs Y2J was the most carnage event I had ever seen. andthe Undertaker vs kurt angle waslike a no holds barred to me. Fully Loaded 2000 was the greatestevent of the year.T@Aand trish vsthe hardy boyz and lita was absolutle the wild match I ever saw.Roll the dice and the events will be wild.Fully Loaded willalways live up its name to me.For dices,blood,and titles fully loaded will live up for scores."
1,Looking forward to the sequel,Buster Olney should be fired for this. Seriously. This guy wrote the obit for a team that wasn't dead. How about the sequel about how the red sox will never win again for like 86 more years
2,Painful Splendor,"A mesmerizing memoir by the talented, vivacious Elizabeth Wurtzel. The pages fly by, the layers are unpeeled, and in the end the reader is left with a raw and very real sense of the addict and all her complexities. Is she a brat? Yes. But a fearless and brilliant one. Great work."
2,Great for Beginners (esp. w/ D40) to Flash Photography,"As versatile as the SB-600 is, the SB-400 is a much less intimidating start to flash photography for the beginner. Using the 400 opens your eyes to the possibilities of bouncing and diffusing the flash. When used in the manual or priority modes on the D40 (and D40X), it is also a great introduction to manual flash settings. With this inexpensive flash, you can learn to bounce, diffuse, and balance ambient lighting.Once you are done with this, you can then go on to Strobist-style off-camera flash photography and spend all that money on the 600s and the light stands, etc.NB The SC-28 cable allows you to take the 400 off camera but it more than a few bucks."
1,Low Quality Headset,"One of the worst headsets I've ever owned. The headset is very uncomfortable to wear, and I can never get the microphone to record loudly enough no matter how much I fiddle with the controls."
2,Better than a conventional loofah,"Growing up as a person of Korean ethnic background, I have used this exact wash cloth pretty much my entire life. I have tried the conventional loofahs and they soon fall apart and become a mess. This wash cloth is rough at first for those not used to it but it makes your skin feel much smoother and cleaner. It's easy to ball up and grip with your hand and then open it up to clean your entire back area, which can be hard to do with a loofah. I'm lucky since I can purchase these at nearby, Korean-owned stores for about $2.00-$2.50. Great product! I would recommend that everyone try it out."
2,explosive,"This CD rocks my world. The singer, Marco, has the most interesting voice I've heard in a while. The band is incredibly tight and the songs have so many great licks and parts. (I dig the e-bow) My favorite songs are ""Fave"", ""worst is Over"", and ""What if i forget"" and ""Work it in"" and ""Elvis"". I saw them live in Toronto and they were right on. At the end of their set, they broke into a story about their band and played each members' favorite song from another band. It was awesome. that's my review..vanessa"
2,Disgruntled Vets...Evacuate,"OK. I have heard it already too many times. O'Brien suffered under the typecast of Vietnam writer for years. I helped contribute to that reputation! Well, this too is a Vietnam novel, but with a twist. Tim has eluded his detractors; taken the painful experience of a lifetime of war (because as sure as the day is fresh war is universal: we all wait for the wolf's knock at the door...) and turned it into an almost Joycean laugh at the cosmic irony of our circumstances. Some readers might think he has somehow belittled their war experience. This reader is a sixteen year war veteran who thinks he has done the finest act of reconciliation with the past possible: he has defused the hard lessons of history through laughter and joy. The war is over. It has been over. What remains are these daily struggles that kill us all. We are ambiguous. We are indeciphrable. Tim has illuminated the world for a moment. We should all be thankful."
2,Even Better,"This, her second cookbook, is even better than the first. Its family style is pleasing. You feel you are sharing recipes with a good friend who is also a terrific cook. The book is a prized addition to my kitchen."
2,A Valuable Resource,"I have found this not only to be very useful, but also it is ver readable. This book consists of enteries of common style, grammar, and word choice mistakes. It's ver easy to find what you are looking for because the enteries are in alphabetical order.The enteries are quite fascinating to read. For example, is ""data"" plural or singular? What's the difference between ""flaunt"" and ""flout""? Can you end a sentence with a preposition? Is the plural for octopus ""octopi"" or ""octopuses?"" The list goes on and on. This book is not dry at all. If you have any interest in language and writing, this is a necessity to have."
1,"good reading, i think....","I don't claim to be an expert, but I've been reading many books like this one & I found several things stated in this book that are contradictory to ALL other authors that I've read so far. In the interest of brevity I'll mention one example: they state ""Bristle Worms are your friend"". Is this true? No other book I've read yet would agree with that. If you visit saltwater supply web sites many of them sell Bristle Worm traps and make statements like ""get those pests before they get your prized specimens"". Who's right? If you read this book be positively sure you read some others and decide for yourself."
2,",i never liked shania 'til I hear this","About a year ago, my boyfriend brought home another Shania Twain CD...it was called ""Wild and Wicked"". Having been a pro singer myself for over 20 years and knowing a guy who had a friend who did Shania's ""live"" sound I wasn't impressed...until I heard the music. Jesus, what happened to her along the way? This CD really rocks and her voice is awesome! I really wish Mutt would produce her again in this rock style instead of her psedo country which rakes in the bucks. C'mon, she's got enough money already...but I've got to say, her voice is awesome even if a lot of the songs aren't!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PANASONIC DVD,I bought this Panasonic DVD recorder DMR-ES10 because Amazon customers said the picture quality was good. Not so! Compared to the TV image direct from cable the image quality from this recorder is flat and grayish. faces show yelowish instead of pinkish without highlights. The manual is written by people who understand the machine but do not have a clue how to write for first time buyers.
1,Predictable & Overacted,"I don't understand why critics around the world joined hands in universal praise for this film. I see an enormous amount of films and I usually tend to agree with the majority of critical opinions, but not this time.Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are both HORRIBLE in this movie. I'm no actor, but to see Sean Penn in ""anguish"" over his daughter is the most unintentionally funny performance of the year. It looks like he decided to try as hard as he could to be ""dramatic"" and all his lines are spoken with an annoying scowl. Tim Robbins is worse, wandering around looking confused and failing to show us any character beyond Tim Robbins: Actor.Don't even get me started about the ending, lame. I saw it coming an hour away. I love Eastwood, but people are pandering to him too much. I've watched better episodes of network TV drama.Overlit Hollywood crap."
2,A++. Great old fashed quality. A joy to use.,This is a first rate product; very high quality and a pleasure to pull out and use.
1,Shamrock Fans MUST READ,If you are a Ken Shamrock fan you owe it to yourself to get this book. It will tell you everything you ever wanted to hear.
2,Excellent radar detector,"The thing which means the most to me regarding this new detector is the ability to ""map"" false signals using GPS. In your driving area, if the unit says ""K Band"" and there are stores nearby, push a button and that false signal location is remembered. No more false signals at that location.The unit telling you your speed when signal is received is nice as well as being able to ""Mark"" known speed traps and give an alert as you approach - all are useful features."
2,a maze,i love shadowman and am waiting for another just as im still waiting a new duke nuke em. i beat the first nin 64 sh man. i bought the guide and proceeded to beat the game by renting figuring its cheaper that way. but the game like most of theese types of games anymore ends up being too much of a maze.i made it up to the last couple levels and havent rented it in a while. eventually ill get back to it to beat it cause the further you get the better and more of a maze. just got tired of running around. i also like turok another cool one.
1,Some good inspiration but...,"There are some meaningful messages in the book. But overall I felt the author was not bringing anything new to the table except hard-to-read doodles. She makes herself sounds like a former lazy bum who is now getting rich off doodling and painting. How nice. The doodles and handwriting really mask the message the book is supposed to convey. But hey, it's a shtick."
1,N is for Not So Fast,"This is the first Sue Grafton book I've read and I have to say that I enjoyed it--UNTIL the ""quickie"" ending, which was such a letdown after having read sooooo many pages to get there. It seemed like the author decided she was tired of writing, couldn't be bothered to explain or justify plot points, and just wanted to be done with it! Such a disappointment."
1,Not much,"This CD has about 15 minutes of video explaining some basic principles--that was useful. Plus it has demonstrations of movements taken from Yang-style and Chen-style forms. Other than that, the only content is brief text with the usual advice (like ""wear loose clothing). Disappointing!"
2,Excellent,"I have this pan and my mom always admires it, so I bought it for her for Christmas. It is a great size and shape, you can use it to cook anything!"
1,Stay away from the low-end coralife products,For the same money you can get a better unit with a TDS meter in it. My unit will not let the membrane seat properly so I can't get the water qualitity that I am suppose to. The hose connections are cheap and the plastic seat connector is quickly wearing out. I see ribbons of plastic come off everytime I disconnect it from the sink.
2,RED (TRU MOTHA *******! SOLDIER) MIAMI,"FAITH EVANS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SINGERS, HOWEVER THE FIRST ALBUM WAS BETTER THAN THE SECOND ONE. BUT I'LL GIVE HER CREDIT FOR NOT ONLY BEING A GOOD MOTHER BUT ALSO A GREAT SINGER. SO GIRL DO YO THING!"
2,I would Highly Reccomend this Album,"This album is truly unique. The instrumental aspect of the music is beautifully mastered, and yet strangely simple. Adding to this is the distinct voice of Chris Martin. You will instantly fall in love with his voice and the lyrics. My favorite songs are Yellow (of course), Sparks, Don't Panic, and Everthing's Not Lost. This is not an album where you have to skip tracks to listen to something decent. Then entire thing is great and you can play the whole album through without skipping tracks. Coldplay is definitely one of the best new bands to hit the US."
1,My Visit to Venus,"The author was definitely flying when he wrote this one. ""Strange and squirrely "" best describes it. I was very disappointed as I have enjoyed many of his other books on Tibetan Lamaism."
2,Amazing band from Finland,"Hearts will be broken; men will lose their minds... so, beware when you listen to this band, fronted by the marvellous female singer Tarja Tarunen. Altugh the band leader is keyboard player Tuomas, she is the high point here.CENTURY CHILD is their new album. IT has more of the same old stuff: catchy and at the same time complex melodies, amazing vocals by Tarja, a feeeling of greatness all around. The baass player is new also, a guy called Marco. I hope they release it in the U.S."
2,Not sure,"I bought it for a secret book club for kids, so I bought it for someone. I hope they liked it."
2,"Varied, to say the least...","The White Album is strange. I listened to this afetr buying Sgt. Pepper's and magical Mystery Tour, probably the two most psychadelic Beatles albums. I was expecting much the same, but my predictions were totally groundless. The songs are eclectic, but highs include ""Glass Onion"", ""Dear Prudence"", ""Happiness is a warm gun"", and Harrison's single greatest song ""While my guitar gently weeps"". However, having loved disc one, disc two was slightly more disapponiting, seemingly containing mostly filler, and a few low key rock songs. It's still a simply mind blowing classic, but maybe it could have been slimmed down a little bit."
1,Shame on you!,"This movie is completely trash; a waste of money and a waste of time. I am surprised at the caliber of actors agreeing to perform in this piece of garbage. Were they hard up for a job? From the opening scene to the end there was no continuity, of story line, let alone even an attempt to connect with reality, which might have given a degree of credibility. At this point it impresses me as some a male high school kid's wet dream, considering the arbitrary use of the four letter word, violence and girl on girl action. Wow it's the Sims gone wild. This cannot even be considered an art film, or even good Sci-Fi. Shame on the director, producer and actors for the perpetration of trash on society."
2,12 year old gamer,"this game is great ya fly around the house have fun or doing missions its cool the game is getting things in the dinning room ,bedroom and more ya gotta get this game"
2,"Look, don't touch","If you're looking for a nice looking katana, wakizashi, and tanto set for display only then this is a good pick. It is a great addition for those who like a Japanese feel in their house. The saiya, or sheaths, for all three swords are a nice, shiny black; the metal is a pleasing silver color. The blades are also very nice to look at. These swords are absolutely NOT for any kind of martial arts practice, whether sparring, drills/kata, or cutting; it's purely for looking good."
2,Perfect!,"Super thin with enough space for a couple of credit cards, drivers license and a few business cards. The money clip is super strong - never seems to bend. Perfect for the front pocket."
1,"simple-minded, lacks information","This book has some good principles, but it is repetitive, and after a while it becomes silly. Whenever you get to a point where you want some hard information, she gives you the names of a few books where you can find it, which is the one redeeming quality of this book. I cannot believe it took her more than a couple of weeks (or less) to write this. It is mostly white space, even when there are words."
1,Shear Disappointment,I have wanted Benny and Joon since I saw it four months ago. I guess aiming cheap was not the best of ideas. Not only did the DVD not play on my gaming consoles it did not play on my laptop or DVD player. You'd think the one thing out of all the items whose sole purpose was to play DVDs would play it... no... it was so far from the truth. You can only imagine my shear disappointment and heart break when none of the devices about would play Benny and Joon.
2,A quiet little clipper that doesn't bother our dogs,"A perfect little hand-held clipper, quiet and effectiveOur dogs don't mind getting the fur on the bottom of their pads trimmed off - it apparently doesn't tickle or otherwise bother them. It works well. It was recommended to me by our pet groomer, and I have to say she's right -- it's a great little trimmer, and a good buy."
1,"Sure it's concise, but potentially written by a 5th grader","OK, my title might be a bit harsh, but not by a lot. I bought this hoping to get a quick overview of Chinese history, with a focus on modern China. First of all, it's way too cursory in my view. But yes, in fairness, how can you cover thousands of years in a couple of chapters?My real complaint, that prompted me to write my first Amazon review, is that this is really one of the most poorly written books I've read. I came to the chapter on Genghis Khan and had to stop reading -- it truly is written like a mediocre high school history paper, in tone, technical writing style and content. I had to put the book safely in a trash container, and am looking for another now.I'm going to be very wary from now on of buying any Idiot's Guide, since their standards obviously are, well... geared towards idiots.My loud and clear recommendation is to skip this one; find a book that won't make you cringe as you read."
1,Amazon shopper,"So i read all the reviews and despite what people were saying I still ordered it hoping there was nothing wrong with the dvd and sure enough the harlem globetrotters episodes were missing,the back side would not play and its so frustrating buying something and having that feeling like your getting ripped off because your not getting what you payed for so people pay attention to the reviews"
2,yay!,"I got this movie just because my job is in it, and it's hard to explain to the new people. But, it shipped really quick, and was packaged perfectly!"
2,4 cats,"Met Thomas save kitten fron the river, Every one wants to be a cat. His friends like to party A LOT!"
1,I laugh at those who found this scary.,"Even stupider than the first. Yes it's that bad. At least the first was funny. This was just stupid. Nothing scary here. It is a movie you can laugh at with your buds though. Doesn't matter when you watch it, in the dark or 2 in the afternoon. This flick won't effect you at all."
1,Too Violent -- Game Should Pulled,"Violence, Vandalism, Murder and Mayhem. This game has no entertainment value. Games should be fun and somewhat educational...the problem is this game teaches all the wrong things to young adults...18-30 year olds included."
2,This is wonderful!! I loved it!!,"I loved this movie! I can't say enough about it! This movie has it all: action, suspense, and romance. Who could ask for more? And, the stars do a wonderful job of portraying these three teens. Oh, and Muponi was really cool! Everyone, word up! This would be great for family fun night, or just lounging around the house.Now really, guys, don't pass this one by while walking the video shelves. I can guarantee it is worth your time and effort to pick this movie up off the shelf and watch it! Who knows, you may even like it! I sure did, that's for sure!"
2,En Vogue-the #1 best girl group!,"Funky Divas is an excellent cd, one of the best released in 1992 and to date for that matter. Unlike most cd's and artists, on Funky Divas En Vogue don't just sing about love and lust. They sing about prejudice, sucess as a group, believing in yourself and paying respect to God. En Vogue are very talented! Talented is an understatement. En Vogue can -really- sing and Foster/McElroy can -really- produce. Keep up the excellent work!! We love you!"
1,Good Concept Bad Manufacturing,"Product has great features, but the quality of the unit is poor. If jolted, the unit will lock up and need to be returned. I've gone through 3 units in the past two months. Also, there are some minor problems with the firmware, which causes the unit to skip songs on occation. I suspect these will be fixed in future firmware releases which are on the company's web site. I found updating the firmware very easy. Other negatives--directions are poor and it is tough to create playlists."
1,it's a scam,"it will not work in my Windows XP. I have repeatedly asked for help;no one answers. Finally, I was told to look it up on a databank. If you have nothing but time on your hands maybe this is for you...but if you work for a living, you've been had by this company Encoreusa."
1,not enjoyable,"it was hard for me to like this album and ive tryed to but its just that awful. i bought this album back in 02 and i was thinking, hey its bustas new album maybe its good. i was wrong. the only songs i liked was shut em down 02, Break yo neck, what it is, and pass the corvosier. all the others were trash. i recommend getting anarchy over this or some old rap albums like pac and old mobb deep"
1,Could have been much better,"I'm a loyal fan of the big 3, Jason, Freddy, and Michael. I will buy this one but was upset that they didn't do a better job. My biggest upset was the over use of CGI. There is something more scary about liquid fake blood than CGI. I would have been much happier had they broke out the corn syrup and food dye. I liked that they tried to make Freddy look more like a burn victim but being too afraid to scare people they watered him down and is less scary again. They should have hid his face for 90% of the movie and than hit us with it at the end. Back story didn't change but didn't add any new life to it either, I kind of expected to see the trial. The scariest addition to the film they didn't take advantage of. The line about having 5 more minutes to play before brain death."
2,Loved it!,Highly recommend this book. Opened up a whole new way of seeing my life and the world. Definitely get this one!
2,Good for iced green tea,"I really like this tea, and it is certified fair trade and organic. The inner package is mylar-like foil and the tea bags are unbleached, and without string. For some reason they are attached in pairs. For iced green tea, I take 2 bags and throw them in a 20 oz. bottle, fill with water, and refrigerate for one hour. Remove bags and enjoy the resulting elixir. Add sugar if you want, by I think this tea is best drunk unadulterated."
1,Crashing down the hill,"This book started out with a bang and slowly went down from there. Blaylock had a great idea, some wonderful characters, but just dropped the ball. He had a wonderful build but then didn't know what to do with the novel and just threw a few unrelated ideas together and ended the book. Because I've heard some good things about this author I'm willing to give him another try and just put this one down as a strikeout."
2,A lively survey & history of inventions & the American home.,"House Of Invention provides some involving stories in the world of invention and the effects of science on the American home, providing a fun survey of the companies and individuals involved in making products for consumers. Science, technology and consumer use blend in a lively survey of how common household products were developed."
1,WARNING - Does Not Help,"This is one of those books that copies all of the information from other books and tries to call it their own (an does not give all the information needed to do the few examples). If need information on bookbinding, the best I have found is Hand Bookbinding: A Manual Of Instruction by Aldren Watson (also available here)."
1,Poor quality,"I like the design of this product. Unfortunately, it did not function well at all - very difficult to hear at any volume setting on the phone."
1,Ridiculously Ridiculous!,"I'd have to write a 200 page review on why this movie sucked royal nuts. So, since I have better things to do with my time, I'm simply going to leave any reader with one of the most uncreative, horrific, and stu-tarded things I've ever seen in a sci-fi movie -An Alien ship that is engaged, powered up, through the use of a few notes on what looks like a wooden whistle! Yep, there you have it folks...you've been warned!"
2,Best general class exam book on the market......,"Gordon West's books are just the bomb, they make studying for your General Class exam a lot more bearable. He presents the information in an entertaining manner that enhances the learning process.Honestly, the West books are just the best on the market for studying for your exam!"
2,A legend brought to life,"As a young girl growing up in Greece, one of the most often told stories I heard was that of Leonidas and his 300 Spartans. I saw the grave marker and his enormous statue at Thermopylae for the first time when I was 5 years old. Since that day I have long for the impossible, to know the courageous men who layed down their lives against impossilbe odds for their country. Steven Pressfield's book brought them to life across millenia to once again fire my imagination and my great respect for their sense of honor and sacrifice to homeland."
1,Dull,"Yes, it was a bit of a romance, but I'm glad I didn't pay any money for it. Too much like a soap opera for my taste."
1,No skirt,"I loved the bedding, but I wish it would have come with a bedskirt and pillow shams. I don't even know where to look for one that matches."
2,awesome,"Realistic, funny, dramatic, and yet, still a happy ending! I loved it! Would definitely recommend this to everyone. Valuable lessons to be learned for all."
1,Not as pictured!,"I just bought this ripstik for my soon to be 11 year old daughter. I thought it was just plain blue, but it actually has strange little characters all over it that you can't see online. I was also hoping it would be smaller. I have seen kids in our neighborhood with smaller ripstiks and I thought this was it. The name implies that it would be a smaller size. It doesn't appear to be any smaller than the big ones to me. I'm debating whether to return it???"
1,Don't WASTE YOUR MONEY....,I perused this piece of 'trash' at a local bookstore one afternoon.....spent all afternoon 'speed reading' it out of curiousity.This woman will stop at nothing to get what she wants. Something we already knew about her.This ponderous piece of garbage and lies adds nothing new to the Clinton name except that it confirms that 'evil' continues to thrive in America.
1,Is the Price worth it?,"This DVD reinforces the reason why people should read the information on the back of the box.I paid close to $20 for this DVD, and it was the biggest waste of money. After watching this movie and realizing that it only gave me 30 minutes of entertainment, I relized that I was seriously jipped.There aren't really any bonus features worth checking out on this DVD either.If you NEED to add this DVD to your collection, I seriously recommend you NOT paying anymore than $9.99 for it.Believe you me, you'll thank me later."
1,More like pulling the needles from my eyeballs,"I bought this book with high hopes that it would live up to all the hype. After forcing myself to read the entire thing, I have to ask ... did the rest you you read the same book? This was the most mind-numbing piece of crud I have ever read. There was no redeeming value in it, and most of it wasn't even coherent. It seems he was going for a stream of consciousness theme, and missed badly. The only thing he wrote plainly about was the sex scenes, and those were just ok. I say stick with his erotic short stories, as that seems to be where his strength lies."
2,Card Speed Versus Camera write Speed,"I have the canon s45 and this card has worked great with it for the past year. People have to really pay attention the the tech specs of the cameras that they buy, all write speeds are NOT the same for ALL cameras. The size and type of file you shoot can greatly affect the write speed also. Dpreview.com lists hundreds of camera reviews and specs, more than you ever wanted to know about digital cameras. Go there BEFORE you buy, be an INFORMED CONSUMER !!! I see so many complaints about CF cards that have to do with assumptions and not facts. amen."
1,fit,liked the product but for someone who always wears a large the large was still too small and was forced to return and re-order.
2,Mysterious Delightful odyssey into evil,"The Ninth Gate is one of my favorite movies that came out this year for the following reasons. First of all, the cinematography of this film is absolutely brilliant and establishes a heavy dark mood throughout fitting for an investigation of this nature. The boundaries of reality seem sketchy and blurred. Secondly, I always love the acting of Johnny Depp, and cannot say enough great things about the mysterious woman who shows up frequently throughout the film. Thirdly, Like The Blair Witch, this film does not spell everything out but rather lets you draw your own conclusions. In this film, unlike ""Eyes Wide Shut"" the technique really works well. Also, the artwork incorporated into this rare book is so cool looking and awesome. Yes, the pace is slower than the current trash Hollywood pumps out, but if you surrender your preconceptions, the Ninth Gate will move you."
2,incredible.,"As a music lover and a romantic, I could not put this book down. I fell in love with the characters; I felt their emotions right along with them. I wanted to stop reading after part one because never before had I read such a perfect love story and I didn't want it to end. Despite the fact that several parts of the book were unrealistic, the emotions evoked by Debartolo were incredible. I went on an emotional rollercoaster throughout this book and I wouldn't have had it any other way. In a word, incredible."
1,slightly adolescent,"When I first read this book, I was on my honeymoon and thought that it was hysterical. Then, since I loved it so much and so did my husband, I read it again and couldn't honestly figure out why I liked it. It seemed incredibly adolescent and just dumb. Some of it was still silly and satisfying, but it just wasn't as funny as I had first thought. Blame it on the newlywed hormones, I guess."
1,No Audio,I was super excited to receive this retro anime that I used to watch when I was a kid but the audio did not work. It wouldn't that big of a big deal but I was really excited for this hard to find anime so that made the disappointment that much greater.
2,great bargain,"Okay, since most of the printers don't come with cables any longer, you always need to purchase one separately. A ""regular"" printer cable can cost around $20 and it can be difficult to plug and unplug correctly without breaking one or more of those tiny prongs. So a USB cable is a great solution. It costs less and it's easy to plug and unplug, especially if your computer has front-mounted USB ports. I bought this one for my new HP LaserJet 1012 Printer and it works just fine. For this price, it's a great bargain."
1,Serious design flaw,"This camera has a serious design flaw. Do not buy this camera if you are planning to use it outdoors in sun light, because you cannot see anything in the view finder. If you have the sun behind you, the sun light makes the view finder appear like a mirror, so instead of looking at the object, you are looking at an image of yourself. If you are facing the sun, the viewfinder appears black. This is with winter sun, cannot imagine what it will be in the summer."
1,bad smell!!,"the reviews made me try this perfume....yeah rright, do'nt get fool with these reviews!!! stinky smell and wont even last for a sec!!! but the shipment so fast!!!"
1,Poor quality,"I have just used the Prime Pacific Stainless Steel Pasta Machine I bought last December. The machine died on my the first time I used it. The problem is the cranks. I have owned other pasta machines, so I can tell that this is the most important and weakest part in all pasta machines. If there are not made of good steal, they are bond to wear out quickly or, worse, break. Well the Prime Pacific Stainless Steel Pasta Machine wasn't up to the job. After only a few passes of dough the cranks broke. And this happen even when I was careful not to put too thick a piece of dough through it. My advise is to avoid the frustration and wast of money on it."
1,A unrelenting snoooooooze fest.,If you ever wondered what a look who's taking meets james bond movie would be like shame on you. It's ideas like that make crappy movies. Don't see this movie it'll be the worst movie you'll ever see. And if you kid keeps on bugging you to watch with them tell them you have a head ache because by the end you will by the stupity of this film.
2,"Excellent, if flawed, epic","What could possibly out do the sheer drama of the greatest crisis this country ever faced? Gettysburg is an excellent film, magnificent in scope, filled with truly great performances (did you ever see Jeff Daniels any better than this?). Just a few flaws: the battles scenes were quite good, but I've seen better, and the film occasionally takes its own historical importance too seriously. Still, a good film, and I can't complain too much, I own a copy. Look fast during Picket's Charge to see Ted Turner as a Condeferate and Ken Burns as a Yankee."
1,It means well...,"Sorry, but I just couldn't take this seriously enough for it to be helpful. I can see the point it's trying to make about positive thinking, but I actually found the CD rather funny,especially when it says ""Relax your kidneys"" How on earth do you do that? Perhaps we Brits are just too cynical."
2,WE HELP MOMMY,I had these books when I was a child and bought them for my own children who are now grown. I've lost them in moving over the years and I'm buying them again for my own grandchildren to grow up with and love too.
1,User friendly? not really....,The interface for this program is not easy to figure out and is not concise. It really needs to come with a full tutorial. my money could have been better spent on something else and i haven't used it once since the day i opened it up and tried it out on the computer. look elsewhere for planning software.
2,A FINE FILM,"Any movie with Charles Boyer is worth it, and the added attraction of Ingrid Bergman and Charles laughton add more talent to this fine film. I would love to have seen the 4 hour version of ""Arch of Triumph"". If you love the B&W classics I recommend it."
1,No charge...,"Spend your money on a worthwhile battery - I'm all for buying generic, but my Canon-made battery's still going strong after two years, whereas the Power2000-made battery conked out very quickly and now won't hold a charge at all..."
2,Great present,I bought this book as a Christmas present for one of my kids. I've got a copy for myself and use it often.
2,Some of the deepest laughs from a travel book.,The book that got me hooked on all his other travel books.Incredibly funny when writing about some of the encounters and experiences he's had with the people. Good light reading if your planning on going to travel in the middle east.
2,Update,Please let me know when you have this cd and Peter Tosh live is in stock. Thank you for your time and hope to hear from you soon.
1,Piece of Junk!,"Purchased as a backup to another D2X SLR 12.4 that had some circuitry go bad. The internal mirrors were filthy; & the shutter release stuck quite badly. The 1st picture taken during each shoot, returned an ""error"" message. Once my primary camera came back from repair, I brought this one in to have it cleaned & to have the shutter release action taken care of. I was told that the cost of repair would be an additional $575.00 (above the original $663.41 that I paid upfront for this ""refurbished"" camera), as there were more mechanical things wrong w/ it than just the shutter release issue. I was royally screwed by this seller; so, purchasers be wary. Hard to think that the seller was unaware of these issues prior to placing it on the market."
2,Great Book,"Scott Cunningham is a great Wiccan author and I would buy any of his books at any time, they are very easy to read, understand and very informative."
1,I'm going to save you the trouble,"The author writes an entire book about recipes which anybody could find in any cook book or online. The ONE and ONLY thing you want is on page 50. It's the reason why just popping a bud in your mouth will not get you high. It has to be cooked for the THC to be extracted and since THC is basically an oil, butter works best. I wasn't going to do this, but the author didn't even get that right. He tells us to combine the butter, ""leaf"" AND WATER in a ""stockpot"". Not true, what you want is a double-boiler to simmer the LEAF WITH BUTTER for 3 hours OVER THE WATER THAT SIMMERS UNDERNEATH AND NOT COMBINING THE THREE MATERIALS. When it's over, strain and press the buds to get all the juice. Refridgerate overnight and use the butter to make cookies or whatever (which fills in the rest of the book with standard recipes).The other snippet of info your probably looking for is whether Police dogs will know that they are pot-brownies, the answer is YES they will."
2,Evocative,"This was a lovely and lovingly written account - however, the plot and story were somewhat simplistic and overly nostalgic.Still, he's very evocative of the high plains, and I really appreciated that."
2,Worth your time to read,"This book is worth purchasing and reading or at the very least leafing through at the library.The author does an interesting job of presenting controversial material. Today if you're not supportive of the Porn Industrial Complex, somehow you're either a puritan or another woman with an axe to grind!Paul is on to something with this well-read (read not another dry academic polemic) and so-so researched book. I don't think her ""study"" meets the requirements of an acceptable social science inquiry, but that is another issue.The quotes and observations from people who view porn are the most telling and allow her to make her point easily."
2,Great Product,I ordered this to add color to the patio I will be trying to make. One of the bottles had opened and spilled in shipment. I called the company up and they sent another right away with no problems. This was the easiest replacement I've ever done. Would definetly order again.
2,General Techniques of Hypnotism,This book is a great resource. It is easily understandable and yet thorough. A welcome addition to any hypnotist's library.
1,a stuffy sloppy book,"The authors explanations on the concept of opportunity cost of capital of an investment, a central concept of standard finance, are so sloppy and confusing, starting from the first pages of their book, that one wonders if they clearly understand themselves the simple probabilistic model underlying standard finance. The fundamental fact of finance, which states that between two securities with the same expected future value investors will pay more for that with lesser variability, is barely mentioned after about 200 pages in the legend to a figure. It is presented as inescapably logical, which it is not. In short this book gives a long and somewhat stuffy presentation of conventional finance but will be very difficult to a reader that really wants to understand finance."
2,Beautiful!,"Boris Vallejo & Julie Bell's art is breathtaking! This is a great wall calendar that will add beauty to your room. Everyone that sees the calendar on my wall has to thumb through it. They are fascinated with their work, and so am I. I highly recommend!"
2,Timeless Truth for Kids (and their Parents),"The Hermie & Friends series is a fun learning and growing tool for Christian parents. In this episode, kids meet Webster, a bright young spider who gives kids a plethora of vocabulary lessons. Wordsmiths will certainly appreciate the dictionary humor.Because this is a Christian video, some may object to the use of a brief reference that the garden will ""look haunted"" by Webster's webs when the garden bugs are discussing their fears of having a ""scary spider"" in their home. Also, as noted by another reviewer there is a reference to some colorful language (a**) by the Actor Tim Conway in the ""extras"" which is inappropriate for intended young audience of these videos. My son (age 4) likes to see the faces behind his favortie characters so it is a little disappointing."
1,Not Great,"This is not my first facial sauna but it is the worst I've used. The ""Cold"" function does not work well (not significantly enough at least) but the hot function works fine. It tends to leak the water you put in, even if you keep it below the max-fill line."
2,men's vest,Ordered this for our daughter's wedding for the groom's men. It was a great color and goes great with the tux.
1,Disappointing,"The show started out well. It had a lot of promise, but then it cut to 10 years later, and that is where it lost me. The acting was not believable. There was a lot of tough girl attitude that the actors in this show didn't pull off. The first five minutes or so were great, though. They really held my interest, and made me think, wow this show could actually be really good. Oh well."
1,Not Worth It,"Yes, the vacuum does pick up well, but as soon as I turn it off, it spits a lot of what it picked up back out onto the floor beneath it."
2,Gives it her all!,"I must admit, I love Noa, but I didn't like her Last international CD - ""Calling"". So needless to say, how happy I am to write this note regarding her new release, the openning song of her new CD ""Blue touches blue"". Great song, great production, a sure bet for a hit. Go Noa!"
2,"This is the best book for anyone, especially teens, to read.",This is the best book I have ever read. It is very inspirational and I have read it more than once. I have cried and laughed. Many of my friends have borrowed it and we all read aloud and shared the special stories.I am sixteen years old and i could really relate to many of the stoies. I can;t wait for the second book to come out! Thanks for such a great book!
1,No luck with this one,"Politically motivated movies are fine, but they can be done more subtle. I don't think this movie is any good in that sense. The Serbian director is trying to present Serbian Army as being attacked, but we all know what happened in Bosnian conflict. Good luck next time."
2,170 Watt 2 Liter Ultrasonic cleaner,"Gave this cleaner to my wife as a gift (she had indicated that she wanted a jewelry cleaner). It has worked well on various pieces of jewelry, silverware, etc and she is pleased."
2,"An excellent, intricate and fascinating book","I first read this book in 1990, when I was a college student. It galvanized my interest in pan-American indigenous-white relations. Now that I am a university professor myself, I teach this book regularly. It's fascinating to most undergraduates -- often mentioned as one of their favorite books of the semester -- without losing any of the intricacy and delicacy of argument necessary to treating the subject of cultural contact and conflict in the Americas. I highly recommend it for any reader; I've given it to people travelling to Peru on vacation and it has greatly deepened their understanding of the land they are visiting and history of their own presence in the Sacred Valley. A great read, highly informative, elegantly written and deeply researched."
1,Very Very Disapointing,"I rented this game for a weekend and I am extremely I bought Jak II instead of this. When I rented this I was ready to stay up all night playing it, after an hour I put it away. This game is a horrible disgrace of the star wars game license which is getting a bad reputation as it is. If it didn't have ground missions this game would have four stars, but those idiots at LucasArts thought ""Let's try to annoy game fans in an all new dimension"" and they added pointless idiotic ground missions. The flying missions and AT-AT or AT-ST or whatever missions are pretty good but can be annoying/confusing, hard core star wars fans should buy this because they will actually keep trying to win those stupid ground missions, but if you just want a good space shooting game get a different rogue squadron game A GOOD ONE!!! So if you like being frustrated out of your mind this is the game for you"
1,Does not fit a 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix,"I really like the Gatorback product, but the 4060660 model does not fit a 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix with the 3.8 liter engine and supercharger. It needs another 10 mm or so, which is why I bought the Dayco 5060665. Lesser quality, but it fits."
1,ANTI-AMERICAN ...,"In this book, rushed out after 9-11, Chomsky starts the process of blaming America for al-Qaeda's terrorism. This is not the work of an investigator analyzing facts, but rather a propagandist making a case and making up ""facts"" to fit."
2,Great Purchase,"My granddaughter loves this kitchen! She calls it ""her house"". It would be nice to have more cabinets to store the food and eating utensils in, but overall the product is very nice and a great purchase."
2,The secret life of clay?,"I haven't got the exact product listed, but all indications are that this product includes what is available in Australia as ""Creature Comforts Episodes 1-6"" AND ""Creature Comforts Episodes 7-13"". Which is to say, for Australians, Season One you may already have got from the ABC in 2 DVDs, and Season Two is not here as of mid-2007.Season One Episodes are:The CircusThe GardenPets at the VetsThe SeaWorking AnimalsFeeding TimeThe BeachIs Anyone Out There?The Pet ShopCats or Dogs?What's It All About?Being a BirdMerry ChristmasI found the characters adorable and the special features information fascinating. Not laugh-out-loud hilarious all the time, but more deep and sensitive and wise than you'd ever expect a clay snail or a seagull to be."
1,A shame,I can understand an artist wanting to develop their music and try something different - but this is simply a departure from good music. Jewel tried some of this material at a gig I went to... and it went down badly. She should have learned her lesson.
2,THE book to own if you want to learn about technical theater,"This book covers every aspect of technical theater. It is comprehensive and the explanations provided make each topic easy to understand. Drew Campbell uses lots of humor to make this book not only informative, but also a great read. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who's just starting out in the theater, both actors and techies alike. You won't be disappointed."
1,Wrong item,"I'm sure this rug is fantastic. Sadly, we were shipped car floor mats so I couldn't really say. Not appropriate for my sons Christmas present."
1,DustBlower,All it does is take the dust from the floor and blow it straight into my eyes from the side vents in the unit. Its more of a torture to use it. It's a pain to clean out because all the debris that did manage to stay in the thing gets stuck to the foam piece in the dust bucket. Honestly a broom and pan is easier and less painfull.
2,Good all around performer,The Zoom H4 has performed very well for me in recording live music sessions. The quality range of 3 wav levels and 1 mp3 is good. The features are excellent but the controls are very compact and take a good deal of getting used to.The only downside I feel is the short battery life. Using 2 AA alkaline batteries I can get 2-3 hours of recording time and then the recorder dies while there is still a lot of juice in the batteries for other applications. So I presently have a collection of about 50 AA batteries which are still good for running toys and flashlights but don't have high enough voltage for the H4. This is a small inconvenience - overall the unit is excellent.
1,DO NOT spend $86.00 on this thing,"I bought a brown zune a few days ago and it's worked great, I love it. Now pretty much everyone one of my friends has an iPod, 30gb, 80gb, nano, shuffle, whatever.. and most of them have one of the FM transmitters put out by iPod or by Belkin, or Griffin, or whatever other companies, and they look and work great! But when I bought this one for my Zune, I tried it out right when i got in my car, and I couldnt get it to sound good without static..! I tried everything, and I just got so frustrated I ended up turning my car around, driving back and returning it to get my 86 bucks back.. I was so disappointed. I was looking forward to listening to my zune in the car with this great looking accessory, but it was horrible.. not just bad, horrible. Don't buy it!!"
2,The best Phish album,"I'm a huge phish fan and like most, I listen to their live stuff far more than their albums. Billy Breathes is the one album that sings to me. I think its because it sounds so much different than their live act. Much of this is do to the soft melodies that come from ""waste"" ""talk"" and ""billy breathes"" all are great songs. From top to bottom, this is a terrific record.If you are looking to get some studio work from this band, I would say this is the one to buy"
2,"Awesome product, but a pain to clean","I love this tool for juicing, whether I'm doing a juice fast or just want some orange juice in the morning. The main downside is how long it takes to clean. Once you unlock the top, there are quite a few pieces to take a part and wash independently, including the round 'grater' which gets the solids stuck in it. I recommend at least rinsing right away so that the food doesnt have a chance to dry and stick to the parts."
1,way too much like West Wing,"I prefer Sci Fi that explores various alien cultures and worlds. Battlestar is so much like West Wing that it sacrifices any hope of such exploration. Olmos even said he'd quit if they added aliens. I like this slightly more than West Wing, but only slightly."
1,More of the same,"For Unlawful....is more of the same from the Van Halen/Sammy Hagr duo. Eddie trying to write the perfect radio friendly song with Sammy Hagar adding another collection of goofy machissimo lyrics. The effort opens up with ""Poundcake"", a basically riffless song with Hagar supplying an ample amount of junior-high lockeroom lingo lyrics. The albums high point commercially was ""Right Now"" complete with a very un-Van Halen-like contemporary smooth jazz piano offered up by Ed much to the delight of soft-rockers everywhere. The video makes the song seem much better than it really is, and that in itself is very un-Van Halen-like. Overall the songs rank as poor as any in the post Lee Roth era where melancholy rules the day. Commercially a high point for the band as they make new fans in the early 1990s, but artistically a low point as per usual with anything Sammy Hagar touches. Skip it."
1,That's it,"I'm sitting here stunned that two days before I'd be getting my ultimate dream- the SW movies on Blu-Ray- I've canceled my order. I have been the world's biggest SW fan since my mother took me to the original in its 1978 re-release as a baby. I love the prequels and everything about them, I love the special editions. I'll never understand why the purists can't appreciate that there's more to SW than ""what I remember as a kid"" and ""cool scary bad***es like Darth Maul"".Now having said that, I watched the new Darth Vader ""Nooooo!"" on YouTube and am appalled. It is heinous and egregious. I'm very angry. But I'm proud to be joining this boycott.-The World's Biggest Star Wars Fan"
2,Easy reading!!!,"This book is very easy to follow with each step illustrated after each step. It helped a great deal in reassuring me that each step was done correctly. The language was easy to understand and follow, this is great for a novice who want to get their feet wet, but must be familiar with RDBM and SQL. I learned to create reports with query and crystal reports, enhanced the application in the application designer and create panels for data entry and so much more. This book is worth the investment."
2,REFRESHING,THIS TALENTED MUSICIAN RISES TO THE OCCASION. THE MUSIC IS GROOVED AND TIGHT. THE CD IS GREAT DRIVING MUSIC AS WELL AS A PLEASING APITISER FOR THAT SPECIAL DINNER FOR TWO.
2,Finally Learned How To Make Arroz Blanco y Habechuelas Como Abuela,With the help of this book I've finally made the perfect white rice and beans! I have been trying to make rice since I was 15 (I'm 22 now) and I've always been unsuccessful....until now! I am so happy! There are so many recipes that remind me of my childhood and growing up with Caribbean - Spanish food. So happy I found this cookbook! Will definitely recommend.
2,Nice product.,"I have used this product for years. Some may notice that Clorox recently changed the design of the scrubbing head so it may look a little different then the picture you see here. I have used both the new and old heads and I can not say there is much difference when it comes to effectiveness.This is a great product. The disposable cleaning heads are easy to change and the unit even has a release so you don't need to touch the dirty cleaning head. The heads also come prefilled with a blue cleaning fluid. So all you so is slosh the new head in a toilet a few times and you are ready to scrub. If you are going to use the same head in multiple toilets you may need some extra toilet bowl cleaner. On a side note I have used the Clorox toilet cleaner liquid and it works fine.My only complaint it that the handle looks weird. Like some sort of disembodied swan head or some alien probe. You may like it, who knows. I keep it under the sink so it is not like I see it much any way."
1,"Nice Music, Mediocre Performance","This CD contains some exquisite pieces that aren't often found on recordings. I bought this CD specifically to have a recording of Cardoso's Milonga and Dyens' Tango en Skai. Gerald Garcia has received much praise, but I simply dislike the way he plays on this CD. The performance of the Milonga lacks rhythmic drive, and the sweeping phrases of the Tango en Skai are unclear at best. There are many better recordings of the famous Lauro pieces, and some of Cinco Piezas are given too soft a touch where more gusto is clearly called for (notably Acentuado). Despite my objections to the performer's interpretations, the brilliance of the compositions usually still shine through and alternative recordings are scarce. If you want a recorded version of these pieces for some reason (I like to play the Milonga), then buy this inexpensive CD. Otherwise, you might as well get a different one."
1,Pathetic editing,"The story itself is interesting. The poor(or total lack of) editing, however, is a huge distraction. Misspelled words, poor punctuation, pronoun errors, etc., interrupt the reading. Even the most basic proofreader should be able to recognize that there is a difference between ""your"" and ""you're""--and that's just one example of glaring errors. It's a shame that a good story is diminished by such carelessness."
2,Very cheerful!,"I really like these bowls. They are microwaveable, which makes it convenient for hot cereal in the morning.A bit difficult to fit in the dishwasher, though."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I was excited when I got this movie for my daughter, but as soon as I started the DVD I was extremely disappointed. Ariel and Jasmine's ""short stories"" are literally one of the shows taken from their corresponding mini series (""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"") that aired on the Disney channel a while back. Poor quality and confusing story lines. The other two are just images taken from the movies and are told in a ""story book"" format. No animation, just the princess' voice. And they last maybe a total of 10 minutes. Like I said, complete waste of money."
2,review Oregon Scientific THT312 Thermometer,"After a miserable experience with [...], I finally acquired the ideal Thermometer from Oregon Scientific THT312 Wired. I prefer the wired Thermometer for an accurate reading. Oregon Scientific had my Thermometer in the mail in 3 days, and on my wall in 2 more.What a pleasure to be treated like the company is interested in my business unlike other companies."
2,Excellent Diaper!,"Switched to these for my 6-month old after the whole ""dry-max"" scare. They have been excellent. They hold a lot of pee without leaking since my baby now sleeps 12 hours straight. I highly recommend these diapers."
2,Amazing,"This is a very cool book. All about the brain, creativity, and writing. Highly recommend it."
1,TOO MANY SMUDGES,Used to use this on my Apple iMac but it left the screen covered in smudges. Switched to Philips LCD cleaner which leaves the glass completely clear.
2,Gets everything clean!,I really like this steam cleaner. It works really well and comes with all kinds of accessories for heavy duty cleaning. I wish it had a couple of attachments for indoor cleaning with softer brushes or cloths on them.
2,fascinating but a 'hard read',"I found the information to be extremely worthwhile, although i found EB's writing style to be dry... not in the 'droll' sense, in the 'boring' sense... still in all, I do recommend the book, very much!"
2,Picnic for Two,"I'm really impressed with this backpack. Its light weight (without all the food packed in it) and is a nice size. All the goodies inside- plates, cups, silverware...are perfect for a nice afternoon in the park or perfect when going on a hike. I think its a nice product at a nice price. Makes a great gift!"
1,pictues come out blurry,"The pictures comes out blurry and it take 4 AAA batteries. You have to constantly buy batteries. I will probably in a year spend more on batteries than i did for the camera itself. But my 4 year old daughter likes it and feels independent with it, so it serves its purpose."
1,Not very good,"First, it came as one big clump. I had to use a hammer to break it up.Not enough peanuts and it stuck (a lot) to my teeth.Not the best flavor either. Tolerable, but there are better choices."
1,He's the Man for His Time and Place,"Clancy's first and most famous novel is a classic. And I don't mean that in a nice way. The story displays complete ignorance of Russian military culture; the dialogue is unworthy of cartoon characters; the ""action"" is a far-fetched excuse for long pedantic discourses on weaponry lifted from the pages of Jane's and Aviation Week; and the author is a draftdodging hypocrite rightwinger who somehow elected not to fight in Vietnam and spent the rest of his life becoming enormously rich lecturing fellow cowards on the wonders of modern warfare. In short, it's the perfect book for the American electorate. You go girls!"
1,Best tell your teenager you liked it,"If you are a parent, you may find that your kids enjoying a hormone charged, somewhat slacker prone group of teenagers navigate life to be a bit distressing. My teenage kids loved this movie, probably for the same reasons it was distressing to the adults. I think this is a great film for teenagers to watch - by themselves - or with parents still connected to their adolescence."
2,great xmas gift,"Purchased this for my Nephew for xmas, he's a big Jet's fan and loved it. It looked much better when I received it than it did in the online photos, and it's seems to be made very well.I'd recommend it for any Jet's fan."
2,Wolfe Wimps on Women Characters,"Yup, this is a great read, but rarely have I found a book so lacking in development of its women characters. The sterotypes are in full, one-note force: grasping, greedy, harpy-like women LOVE to tear their men down, while happily emptying their wallets. At the other extreme, and this saves the book and makes it the compulsive page-turner it is, the male characters are diverse, whole, and beautifully portrayed. Like many other customers, I too found the last chapter to be a disappointment...Wolfe obviously had a deadline to meet, or just ran out of juice."
2,I Can't Decide,"I can't decide if this is my favorite album of the year so far, or Devin Townsend's Synchestra. This is definately Muse's most diverse album. They completley re-invent themselves with every album and this one is certainly no different. The first time I heard Supermassive Black Hole I absolutley hated it, the second time I listened to it I absolutley loved it. It has a very Prince feel to it, which is a good thing. Overall this album is Muse's most diverse effort to date> i can see great things happening for this band here in the states."
2,Three's Company always makes me laugh!,"Three's Company is my favorite TV show. I love all Three's Company seasons but especially these later episodes with Furley. I have all Three's Company DVD's and season's 6,7 and 8 have provided us with much laughter over the past several months. In tough times laughter can sometimes be great medicine and Three's Company is one show that receives a 10 star rating in my opinion. I especially love DVD's because you get all of the laughs without all of the annoying commercials! I would definitely reccommend this DVD series."
2,Cool look!,Let me say that I really like the look of this toy and it makes nice laser patterns so it does everything it is supposed. The only drawback is that unless you want a toy that is cool to look at when it sits on your dresser you can get the same functionality and MORE from the Pocket Laser Light Show. And with the pocket version is MUCH smaller and portable.I bought both when I bought this and while they are both great I like the pocket version better
1,GHQ still alive,"The interesting thing with Truth Sayer's review is the blamings made here are quite similar to GHQ's propaganda when Japan had been under its despotism.I think seeing the GHQ propaganada and censoring is a good start for Japaneses and Americans to release ourselves from the fallacy. ""Nanking Massacre"" had been a part of GHQ's propaganda program.I recommend Hosaka Masayasu's ""Nihon Kaitai"" (Breaking up Japan) to know about the GHQ propaganda and Etou Jun's ""Tozasareta Gengo Kuukan"" (Closed Language Space) for pursuing the censorship. Kai Yuzuru's ""GHQ Censor"" is a must read for all Japaneses, which is a first hand testimony written by the former censor who had been working in GHQ."
2,Durable!,This frisbee lasts forever. I used to buy my Jack Russell Terrier the floppy disc and she would destroy it in no time. I've had this frisbee forever. Definitely worth the money.
1,much worse than first edition,"I am a statistics graduate student and have read this book, the first edition of this book, and parts of the full version (Categorical Data Analysis - Agresti 2002). This edition (2nd) of Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis is not as good as the first edition or the 2002 edition. The examples are hard to follow and the SAS output is difficult to replicate in some cases. Do yourself a favor and use the 2002 full version. It will save you a lot of time and frustration.Categorical Data Analysis (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)"
2,What Else Can You Say??,"Beautiful, inspirational, spiritual, amazing, and every other platitude you can imagine. No jazz or Coltrane collection is complete without this one! Lie back, listen, and be changed for good. In a word, superb. An album supreme."
1,Garbage; utterly useless.,"In the last three weeks, in my workshops, I have witnessed 4, that's 4 Hoya polarizer filters fall apart in my or my student's hands, one purchased the day before at the Ansel Adams Gallery in Yosemite National Park. What's even more disturbing is this is an old problem. Google ""hoya polarizer filters"" and you'll find narratives about this dating back 6 years. And they do scratch easily... No more Hoya for me. No wonder you see so many Hoya filters at deep discounts lately; the word is getting around. Buy anything but Hoya..."
1,DRM = killjoy,"The gaming companies still don't understand that annoying their paying customers isn't going to bring more profits.There has been no game ever which hasn't been cracked, so the draconian DRM is just going to be noticed and endured only by the people who actually support the company by paying for the game. The people who download it illegally are not going to notice anything."
2,still fun to play,"Although this is an older game, I bought this game for my 8 year old nephew for xmas 2009 as my kids had really enjoyed playing it. In talking to him and my sister, he has not been able to stop playing it. Lots of fun - building roller coasters and other attractions. He especially likes to build steep ones so people who ride them get sick, requiring a maintenance guy to have to come and clean up the mess."
2,Yoga rocks!!!,"Loved the DVD already; mine had gotten tangled in the VCR(that tells you how long I'd had it!!!), and the service was fast!"
2,Magnificent,"Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jack Dawson, a poor artist who wins a ticket on Titanic's first voyage to New York. He saves the life of Rose (Kate Winslett), who is engaged to the stuffy Cal (Billy Zane). In only four days, Jack and Rose fall in love, and then disaster strikes.DeCaprio nicely captures the youth, romance, and energy of Jack. Winslett's performance just didn't ring true to me. Zane was wonderful as the villian you love to hate. But the real star of the show is director James Cameron, who created jaw-dropping special effects on such a grand scale. The sinking of the Titanic is unforgettable. James Horner's soundtrack is memorable, too. This movie deserved its Best Picture Oscar."
1,My Opinion,"I think its an interesting book....thats is, it would be if I could understand half of the words. Its really well written and the story is good but who does the author expect to know what he's talking about?"
2,metal album of 2005,"To think this band once rode in the wake of nu-metal, this album will see them lead the way in heavy metal. There is absoultely nothing missing, this cd makes bands like bleeding through look like six year old kids bashing instruments. I put this cd in and was entirely gobsmacked!"
1,Not worth it.,"Basically what this is 6 perfectly good songs from No Jacket Required and remixed. The end result is horrible. Only You and I Know is the only song that came out half-decent. They all sound like they were recorded in a one-room st-st-studio.(Sorry couldn't resist.) Die hard fans will probably like it, but regular fans probably wouldn't like it...at all."
1,Are you kidding Gerber?,"This knife is no longer made of Sandvik steel as advertised! Instead you now get a 420HC blend - essentially the same found in cheap Dollar Store knives....If you're looking for a backpacking/camping knife suitable for making feather sticks/bushcraft this knife is not it. With the blade being so thick, serrated, and made of such cheap steel, it's almost impossible to get long, consistent, curling, feather sticks that are thin enough to take a magnesium spark.This knife is essentially a sharpened crowbar. It is more suitable for prying open metal containers and bashing out car windows on a battlefield than curling feather sticks and gutting trout on the trail."
2,Circus Contraption is going away,"Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, get 'em while they're hot!Circus Contraption is an amazing Seattle-based performing troupe who also happen to be great musician in the circus/klezmer style. Dark, funny, charming and satirical, they have a Brechtian/Tom Waits-ish style that is uniquely theirs and not to be missed.Unfortunately, after 10 years of performing in Seattle and across the country, including to rave reviews in New York, they are calling it quits as a troupe and going separate ways. In a few years, who knows if you will be able to find and buy this music still?Get 'em while they're hot!"
2,My 45K a year book,"This is a great book for anyone who wants to write better, stronger, and with more conviction. Someone told me a few years ago that reading this book would improve my writing at work. Four promotions, 8 years, and a dream job later, I went from less to 15K to 60K. Some of that was hard work, but much of that was practicing the advice in this ""little book."" It is funny, straightforward, and I have given away so many I can't keep count. Highly recommend this for anyone who has to write letters, memos, reports, etc. as part of their job."
1,"I thouhgt it was 50,000 miles rehashed","I read his book ""After 50,000 Miles"" and liked it. I have some years of additional experience sailing since then. I didn't think this new book added much, even though the format was a bit different. As he often mentions, opinions vary. I don't agree with everything he says, but I do agree that experience, rather than reading about it, is the only way to find out what the realities of sailing are. Perhaps it is because I am experienced, but much of the book is what is obvious, or what is available in 100 other books on blue water sailing. I was excited when I got this book, but less excited with each page I turned. Good pictures and illustrations though."
2,disney neon wall clock,"excellent product,my daughter loved that it lights up neon pink in the dark,she out grew it,so we passed it along to a friends daughter who now enjoys it!!!!!!!!!"
1,Waste of Money,This CD is a waste of money. Its not the origional you hear. You buy and then listen to find out its not what is advertised. Then you find out your stuck with it. Happy joy joy.
1,Unsafe,"While the toy was turned off, my son stuck his hand in opening to just past his wrist and got his hand stuck. This was horrible. I thought we were going to have to break his hand to get it out."
2,Solid Book,"This book is solid for those new to the bass instrument or haven't played in a while. It will definitely strengthen your playing,sic and your technique. There are both TAB and a music staff, making this book accessible to music readers and non music readers."
1,broken when recieved,"This Vhs tape was sold as very good condition. It would not play on my VCR so I gave it to my daughter,she had the same results. This was my first purchase on Amazon. I bought the same movie again from another supplier yesterday,hope it works."
1,Worst kids' book I've read to my son,"Don't go any further: do NOT get this book. Disjointed and sends a terribly disobedient message. The full scope of the story is that Max runs away from home because he can't have ice cream for breakfast, is rewarded by Grandma, and then comes home to a permissive mom who doesn't care. I can't find a single redeeming aspect to this book!"
1,This Item came up in a search for aggressive chewers...,I have a 3 year old Golden Retriever/ Lab mix. This item came up in a search for aggressive chewers b/c he more than likely will destroy whatever toy you give him. His Kong even has a few tears in it. He chewed this toy apart in about an hour.
1,Horrible film quality mars an otherwise decent film,"I could not believe the bad quality of the footage. No, it has nothing to do with the original footage. Even the credits were very blurry and blocky. I have had the misfortune of buying another video set, on VHS, by this same company. Same dismal results. I would recommend looking elsewhere. The company that makes this video has released lots of video sets with flashy pictures, but when you actually view them, you realize how shoddy their workmanship is. It looks like a bad propaganda film from the 1950s. My other video set actually was: War in the Pacific."
2,"Cheaper, better than OM","I have an older Makita 7.2-volt drill-driver I prefer for its compact size and light weight. Just the thing for working overhead. A local big-box store used to carry these batteries for $40, and they only seemed to last a year or so. Now that that store no longer carries these batteries, I have been replacing my OM batteries with these batteries as my OM batteries wear out. Not only are they cheaper, but they last longer - the first one I bought is still going strong."
1,Terrible,This guy is horrible really. He is denying everything and anything. Don't do this. Don't do that but he doesn't say what to do. It's like he is just there to criticize everything. Loser. I really hated this book. Don't get into the character. You don't know how it feels to feel what the character feels! Rehearsals won't help. Working on the script won't help. It's like he says give it up. You can't do it!!!!!!! Feel like I would punch him if i ever meet him YUCK!!!
1,Junk,"Our first unit went through batteries like candy- 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. We returned it and the replacement averaged about 3 weeks to a set of batteries. There are a lot of missed cars before the low battery alarm shows. Now, after 4 months (90 day warranty, of course) the detector is sending constant false alarms. This product is a waste of money."
1,Motor failed after 1 use,I purchased this food chopper so that I could make Tzatziki sauce. The cucmber was chopped quite fine and I was delighted until I tried to use the chopper for a second time. No bueno por nada!
1,Too far left to be associated with Jefferson,"I couldn't finish this book. After about 25% of the book, the author's leftist views were too overwhelming. I had originally purchased it expecting a book about returning to the Constitution, but I was mistaken.When the author wrote on historical events, it was very interesting. He talks about the Native Americans and truth about the Boston Tea Part, which was great, but then he goes into bashing George Bush. I stopped reading once I came across a statement that connoted that the Founding Fathers' views were not the same as the views of Libertarians."
1,Toy Story 3 (blu ray) DEFECTIVE (3 times),"LOVE the SHOWS - all 3 of them, Disney/Pixar ROCKS !!!However, in this particular (very CHEAP and SHODDY Toy Box Edition) the Blu-Ray version of Toy Story 3 is DEFECTIVE (starting at Scene 25) I have returned the product THREE TIMES, the final return was for a REFUND. Sad, because we really wanted the ""set"" ..."
2,Risky Business,Engaging read. Expected love story ending. Devious ring leader. Unfortunate end as a result of good intentions while seeking redemption.
2,Snugglely Flannel Sheets,Very comfortable. It's easy to relax into the soften of flannel sheets. I picked the blue snowflakes to complement the cold season and for the relaxing aspect.
2,Family Fun!!,Pro: My kids enjoy this alot. Build different things together. Its amazing what kids can build with these. Cons: It get pricey when you need more sets!!
1,DON'T USE COMPANY OR PRODUCTS...,"I HAD TRIED THIS COMPANY WHEN I ORDERED 3 CANS OF WHITE PAINT. IT TOOK 15 DAYS TO SHOW UP AND THE RESULTS OF THIS PRODUCT WAS A JOKE. SO, THEN I SEE WHITE GARDEN FENCING FROM SAME COMPANY BUT THE SPECS ON THE SITE WERE CONTRADICTORY SO I TRIED TO CALL THEM FOR 2 HRS. ON FRIDAY, EVEN LEFT A MESSAGE. NOTHING. CRAP PRODUCTS, CRAP WEBSITE, CRAP CUSTOMER SERVICE."
2,Buy this!,"I never write reviews, but this thing is awesome. I had really bad back pain in the mornings and couldn't even bend over...after buying this, the pain is gone! I even tried physical therapy, but just by simply adding this mattress topper, it's taken away all my back pain! So comfy and I loved the green tea scent!"
1,Not up to their usual standards!!!,I struggled through the first 150 pages since the book bogged down with food descriptions and was very slow moving. It did get a little better the second half. The ending was to be expected. I enjoyed their first books. You couldn't put them down. You CAN put this one down!!
1,2 Stars for the track HYPNOTIZE,"I sit her and listen to SOAD, TOXICITY, and most of STEAL THIS ALBUM!, and i was stupid enough to rush myself into wasting money on Mesmerize, which DOES have its moments... but i truly believe that Hypnotize is 100% filler... I've never been dissapointed by this band... they did it though...and jesus, serj, cut your hair... you look rediculous man"
1,"A good album, but made me mad","I did kind of enjoy this album, but there are way to many bad things about it. First of all, being from NY i had heard of about 5 songs that were supposed to be on this album that werent. As a matter of fact there were only 12 new songs, with It's Alright and Money Ain't a Thing as so-called ""bonuses"". Plus on almost every track there were guest stars, which takes away from the actual artist."
1,Not all it could be,"The problem with this novel is that the backdrop is more interesting than the foreground. We want to hear more about the Spartacan rebellion, its effects on slaves and how they felt about it, their temptation (to join in) and their fears of doing so. But the slaves in this novel, who are after all are at the heart of plot, are flat -- they are simply the objects that the patricians pretend, in their elaborate make-believe, they are. The result is a narrowly circumscribed who-done-it in a Roman setting (""Colonel Mustard in the Billiards Room with a Knife""), a slight entertainment that begs for more."
1,Ack! Anyone want a copy of this? Take mine!,"If there was anything lower than one star I would give it to this album. It seems like every band that comes out of the UK is worshipped. Mansun is one of the many who does not deserve this worship. The songs are dreadful, unoriginal, and just plain boring. I forced myself to listen to this album four times before I condemned it, I now realize I listened four times more than I should have!"
1,Not to be read over time!,"I'm a reader who enjoys taking time with a good book...following character development and plot to a satisfying ending. A book that you can put down...and then pick up. Perhaps taking a week to complete. This book was impossible for me. The author takes the main character throught at least four different phases of his life, (big city cop, small town deputy, psychologist, inmate). The problem is that you never are certain which phase the character is in.......or how it relates to the main plot, if there is one. If you enjoy picking up a book and immediately reading it from cover to cover you might ""catch on"" and enjoy the book. If you're more like me, then you might want to look elsewhere!"
1,this clock is JUNK,"ZERO STARS!!First of all, let me say that I bought this atomic clock because I've had others in the past and enjoy having the correct time. So I do know how to use one.This one, however, has been nothing but a headache. Upon set up it never did catch the signal, so we had to figure out how to set it manually, which is annoyingly difficult.When DST began, the clock did not change. Another headache resetting it.Today the thing went completely crazy and the hands just began racing around, never stopping. We took out the battery and reset it and then it began losing time.DON'T BUY IT!!!"
1,it is good but its life is few days,"its like a disposable juicer, because it after few uses starts creating lot of sound and strong vibrations that my neighbours won't let me use this. and when I try to contact krups, I get to know that I need to send them this product at my cost ( thats about 50% of the cost of product )and then they may decide whether they will repair for free or not. Other companies send you a free label at least. well. I felt initially that it was a good product, but the trouble is that its life is only few uses, now dont have any option but to throw it and buy some other one."
2,amazing fresh and contemporary Irish,"After eating Kevin's soup in his restaurant, I had to have this book! Local and fresh done so well in Ireland."
2,Interesting Concept,"From an animal lover's perspective, I really enjoyed this book. I liked the character, Pooch, who was becoming human after having been a dog. It was interesting to see the dog-like characteristics she kept along with the human characteristics she acquired.I didn't really care for the feminist tones in this book. I thought men were portrayed in an extremely negative way. Still, I could overlook this and find an interesting story of animals becoming human and humans becoming animals."
1,A snooze,"This movie was a snooze fest. There were a lot of things that were obviously supposed to be funny, but the ""humor"", for the most part, just does not work. Obviously a lot of people disagree with me, but I did not find this movie to be entertaining at all."
2,Stone brings it again,"Buy the Album. There is no two ways about it. If you like old school soul and rememeber when R&B was about something, then this CD is for you. Buy ASAP!"
2,A great holiday read!,"This book moves through time from the ancient to the modern, and follows the story of an ancient couple that has learned how to live as long as they choose.When I first started reading it, I was questioning if it really was my kind of book. I'm glad I stuck with it! Robbins has this incredible writing style that combines well written prose with clever similes and metaphors. Just like David Letterman, he will be writing something serious and out of the blue he'll throw in something that adds a decidedly comedic mood. So it's not an easy read, but extremely enjoyable.On of the most refreshing things about the book is the way that Robbins will be writing about ancient times, and driving his points home with modern and humorous images. He was ""shaking like the shuttle in an overachiever's loom"" or ""The Middle Ages hangs over history's belt like a beer belly."" I don't know if everybody would appreciate this kind of writing, but I loved it. I'd recommend this book to anybody."
1,Spine-Worx didn't do anything for me....,"I bought Spine-Worx on Amazon...having had constant back pain as a result from an auto accident over 20 yrs ago, added body weight and just plain back pain. I used it the way the instructions called for and nothing happened. I used it every day and gave it a 30 day try and still nothing. Maybe you will have different results than I did."
2,"In all seriousness, it's funny","One of the funniest movies ever? Of course. I've never seen it look so good. Since I'm use to crummy TV versions that didn't include the jive talkers' subtitles, I was far from disappointed with this DVD. The 5.1 is excellent for the film's age and the commentary is interesting; although the film makers do spend most of the time laughing at their own jokes (fair enough).They also make mention of some deleted scenes, SO WHERE ARE THEY ON THIS DVD!!! ..., this is still a must for the collection. I wonder if that guy's still in the cab; I guess we'll never know."
1,This toy stinks,What a horrible toy! The instructions were vague. The cartridges did not seem to load correctly. One stink cartridge broke on me. The smell is gross (old socks and trash says the 9yr old recipient). The toy is in the garage now where it won't offend anyone. My sister gave this to my son for Christmas (probably to get back at me for all the times I farted in her face). Next year her son gets a steel drum.
1,Not for new TVs,On the package it says this will carry 720p or 1080i signal. If you have a 1080p signal this won't carry full signal.
2,Amazing electronic jewel but recording is missing,Everything almost perfect with this fine item. Video and audio quality is amazing. Control is perfect but need a little training.The only cons are: not recording and AC adapter not included.
2,Wonderful,I bought two of these faux amber necklaces and they are quite well made. The pendant is almost 2 inches in length it does look larger in the photograph but by being smaller it looks more realistic. It is actually a good weight not to heavy not to light it looks as if some effort has been put into the making of it. I think it is a good purchase for the price because it does not look cheap or tacky.
1,Several typos and other problems with the text,"I'm only a few chapters into this free Kindle version of this title and have already noticed the following problems:- Every phrase or word that is italicized in the original text is rendered in ALL CAPS in the e-book. This is incredibly annoying to me - it feels as though Wharton is shouting at me, when we all know she would never do such a thing :-) She is much more subtle than that!--Every time Undine's name should be followed by a comma, it's followed by a period instead, thus bringing the narrative to a dead (and incorrect) stop.--Typos are starting to appear, such as ""Mrs. Fairford"" being typed as ""Mrs. Pairford.""If this kind of thing doesn't bother you, then this will probably be fine for your Kindle, but if you find these issues as annoying as I do, you may want to look around to see if spending a few dollars will get you a cleaner version of this classic."
1,Poor connection,"I thought this would be a cost effective kettle for my office. It arrived very quickly, but I had to return it immediately.This is a one piece kettle & has the powercord that attaches into the base of the kettle. The cord would not stay connected in the kettle, it was so loose the only way I could get the kettle to boil was to hold the cord in place. I got a 2 piece cordless kettle instead, similar to the one I have at home and am very happy. This little kettle is not worth the price, getting a cordless with no parts to plug and unplug is worth the extra 7-10 dollars."
1,A waste of your money and time,"My D-Link DI-604 stopped working all of a sudden afterabout 5 weeks or operation.D-Link technical support has refused to replace it,and wasting 2 hours of my time on the phone.I have gotten rid of it now.I would not recommend it to anyone.Cheap maybe.."
1,The Worst CD Ever,"I love T Rex, have several CD's but this one was RETURNED. This CD didn't even sound like him, the sound was terrible. The songs must have been dug up out of a basement somewhere and should be put back!!! Terrible CD!!!!!!!"
2,Just Too Good To Miss,"When you live in a place such as Washington finding good hispanic music is hard. When you are able to hear and buy a ""new"" album you know it must be doing pretty well,and this time Ricky Martin's Vuelve didn't have the need to be searched for. A simple mix of different and unique sounds made it successful, and Ricky's charm won every girls heart once more... he is just too good!!!!!"
2,Robert's Rules Rule!,"If you wish to be consistent in your meetings, ""Rules"" is essential -- this edition allows quick checks with the option of going to the complete rules when necessary.I recommend this brief edition highly"
1,"Ramble, Ramble","Interesting because it's a true story, and for Canadians some recognizable names, but oh does it ramble. This story could have and should have been told in 100 pages not 373."
1,Winning Strategies for Video Poker,"This was probably a great book when first printed, around 1997, but it doesn'tcover most of the games I now find in the Las Vegas casinos."
2,890R yard tool,"What a great product! It is versatile, especially with the optional attachments ( I have the hedge trimmer and the cultivator). I am especially pleased with the power of the engine, even though it is remarkably quiet compared to two cycle engines. It may cost slightly more but it seems to be worth it."
1,Lame and Inane,"Perhaps this cozy mystery has more to offer to the long-time readers already acquainted with the numerous characters. Family dynamics might have been amusing to someone more familiar, but were simply an irritation to this reader. Replacement hips, broken shoulders, deafness, dementia and free loading 30-year old kids simply are not amusing. Too many characters, living and dead, that just kept popping up throughout the book made it almost impossible to keep up with the story, the chatter was over the top, but not delightfully so, and the mystery was so very convoluted I really didn't CARE who had done it - I was just ready for the book to end. Where Ms. Danheim REALLY lost me though, was when a character was calling the airlines to check on passenger manifests. There should be SOME reality in a cozy mystery, some clever twists, and a lot more of setting and research by my thinking. This was a senseless hodgepodge."
2,would have liked to have seen a complete box set,"I would have liked for sony to have reliesed a box set of the entire series , judging by the way sony gets these sets out it will take 12 years or more , i hope we can see at least 3 volumes per year.......but i won't count on it"
2,no more stacks of books,"I purchased the Kindle, and its cover one month ago, and love it. The cover is a bit expensive, but for me it is neccessary. It protects my Kindle and give me a feel of reading a ""normal"" book. The Kindle came with all my data in it, and I could order books immediately. In a few second an entire book appeared. The only drawback is that it is easy to order a book while looking ..... I have done it twice, but immediately pushed yes for ""did you order this book by accident?"" The books were charged, but cancelled 4 -5 hours afterwards. Now I can download a sample, read it, and order the entire book. No more waiting for books to arrive, and no more stacks of books to donate...Another reason for buying the Kindle is that I spend most of the summers in Europe and this will replace the stacks of books I have to take."
2,Works Good,"I bought this HDMI Cable on Amazon, it works fine out of the box. I would recommend for ppl who are looking for a less expensive HDMI cable.Cheers"
2,Great Buy!,"Just bought this and love it! Easy to assemble. Easy one hand recline positions, which is great for my baby who hasn't quite mastered sitting up. Great neutral color."
1,Bad language description,"The purpose of simplification leads to incorrect explanationsin the subjects related with the language itself.Chapters 6 and 8 have statements that a C (or javaScript orActionScript) programmer consider confused (variable types,expresions, etc) others are amazing (ex. page 107 : k=k++)and other false (ex. page 104 :explanation about postincrement in loops).Programming concepts should be correctness handle, evenfor designers."
2,Great healing tonic,I use this for all sorts of things--couple drops in dogs water helps clear up bad breath for one! It is great to have on hand.
1,WHAT? Twenty bucks?,"I've been seeking a soft solid unscented deodorant and can't seem to find them any longer in the stores. For some reason, it appears these types of deodorants have been discontinued in all brands. Does anyone know why? And I would BUY this one, but for the sad and obvious fact that this seller is taking advantage of the dirth of these products still available. I mean, really. Almost twenty bucks for one deodorant? Can we spell R.I.P.O.F.F? Thank you, no. I'd rather go on stinking, just like this seller's conscience."
1,Downton Abbey,We have a black President. In Rome they are campaigning for a black Pope. All we need now is a black Queen in England. This DVD is still a soap opera.
1,babys first christmas a fisher price let down,I bought this for my son after playing with it for a few minutes the discs quit spinning the only thing that did work was the music and lights. So now we have to fight the retuns crowds and try and find another toy in the left overs of the christmas rush. I was very disappointed with the fisher price company this christmas.
2,Top 3 album,"I have worn out 2 cd players listening to this cd. This captures the late 80s musical scene, at the top of which was Paul Cebar. Musical syncretist and crypto-columnist, he and his band are like no other. Kind of a Dr. John of the North."
2,Excellent mid-level book,"I found this book to be very easy to read. Once you understand this book, then you can read Gray & Meyer or more advanced books pretty easily. I have never read a real beginners book in Electronics and I was still able to understand it. Nevertheles this book might be a little too advanced for some people who are studying electronics for the first time. However for a mid-level book it's pretty good and people should not judge the book harshly if their professor assigned it for a beginners class-it's not the book's fault but the professor's. I had struggled with many bad mid-level books and so I know this book does a good job compared to many. I originally had the first edition. I had read it so many times that the pages were falling off, so I bought the second edition as well. I skimmed through the latest edition and it's almost the same as the second edition."
1,They won't Work!,They won't work in any of my dvr's! Need 6X or below for all my stuff. Let me know if someone wants to buy them...I'll be happy to ship them back!
2,A good book in a good series.,I am enjoying each book I read in this series. I am looking forward to continuing in the next book.
2,What a delight!,"This is one of the most thoroughly enjoyable books I have read in a good while. Mr. Kneale's use of the English language is amazingly satisfying, and his structuring is superb. Each of the over 20 characters who narrate this novel are fully fleshed out, and their stories are all fascinating. This is a writer to watch out for!"
1,Not worth the money,"even if it is a cheap buy, it just doesn't work! try several time without success. My TV box which is in a cabinet is then useless without opening its doors"
1,Steer Clear,"This is the worst book ever. Ever. I had to purge it from my library, even though the act of purging a book from my library racked me with guilt. It was required reading in a writing class I took, and I hated every minute of reading it. I hated it so much that I made my sister read it to see if I was crazy. She hated it as well. That was in 1998. We still hold this book up as the worst book ever written, except maybe Moby Dick.If this had been a good book, I would have liked it. I am fascinated by the medieval period, and tend to gravitate toward books (fiction and non-) about that era. I like the good murder mystery most of the time. I should have liked this book. But it was beat-your-brains-out awful. The writing was stilted and unnatural. The characters were inhumanly flat.Awful! Awful! Yuck Yuck Yuck! Do yourself a favor and stay away. Or at least, if you really feel you must read it, go check a trash bin somewhere and I'm sure you'll find a copy."
1,hassle to buy this product,"The lug nut key requires a 13/16"" socket or 21mm socket. if you have a honda/acura or any car that doesnt supply a 13/16"" or 21mm wrench, you'll need to carry an extra socket and ratchet in addition to the wheel lock key in your car. Additionally, since you have tuner style lug nuts, that means you also have another special key lock for these nuts. So troublesome."
1,A real disappointment,"I purchased this for my daughter's Human Anatomy class, thinking that it would assist her with her dissection. She didn't even use it after opening it to check information. She stuck with her Gray's Anatomy (Student's edition). Unless you just really like long, drawn-out explanations, this is not the text for you."
1,cheap,Mine is six months old now and only played once or twice a week. The top broke off the cd player last night. The display is not lit up at all. The sound is okay for the price but it has stopped playing cd's about half way through their play. I was here looking for a new one when I saw this and thought I should review it.
2,Best Camera Ever,I love this camera so must that this is the second one I bought for my dad for father's day. It is very easy to use and take wonderful pictures right out of the box. The price makes it affortable for anyone and the soft wear is wonderful. You can do so much with your pictures for free with most of the soft wear and easy to use. You can upload and share big picture files that they can use for free to see and down load. I tell everyone about this camera and that Amazon has the cheapest price.
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,"My husband and I got this as a gift from his sister when our son was born. At first we were really excited about it. Then we tried it out. TEN REASONS NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT!1. hard to follow instructions2. bags can get expensive3. horrible to change it4. not very easy to open when holding a baby5. smelled 20 times worse, especially when you changed the bags6. HORRIBLE SMELL WHEN YOU TAKE THE BAG OF DIAPERS OUT7. not scented at all8. not worth the money9. would rather throw diapers in my trash can than in this10. not scented but of dirty diapersAll I have to say is don't make the mistake of buying this item it is not worth it. My husband and I would both fight over who was going to change the bags. The smell was so bad! I am not kidding! It does not work. We ended up throwing ours away!"
2,Very comfortable but they become too loose.,"I found these to be very comfortable, even with heel spurs. I wear them around the house instead of slippers. After wearing them for a few weeks, though, the fabric strip between the toes became too loose and now they don't fit as well."
1,not so good,within one hour of playing my ps3 this cable died on me for what i paid for it i am not requesting to return the item but i would buy another one of them.
2,Fabulous Multipurpose Pan,"I bought this pan about 8 months ago, and have used it several times a week since then. It distributes heat evenly, cleans up very easily, and looks great. I've used it for everything from boiling water for pasta for one or two, to making yogurt, to stir-fry, and have not been disappointed.Since then I have bought another pan in this series, and it performs exceptionally well, too."
2,Mild,"The taste is very very mild, no harsh undertones or aftertaste. Traditional uses include the removal of toxins from the body, curing dysentery, weight loss, improving eyesight, promoting blood circulation and reviving those who have over indulged in alcohol. There is also a recent research interest in Pu-erh tea for its ability to reduce cholesterol, lower blood pressure, protect connective tissue, and its ability to attack free radicals within the body. I had hoped it would help with blood sugar, but after drinking a cup first thing in the morning, no food intake, my blood sugar had upped by ten points . . . but if the other benefits are true, then worth keeping as one of the teas for the day."
1,This one is for beginners only,"I can only imagine this book being beneficial to someone who has never used any sort of graphics software. Of the approx 260 pages, 220 are used showing the reader how to use the standard drawing tools and associated functions, that most will find very redundant if they've EVER used Illustrator, Paint Shop Pro or anything similar. The really cool tricks that Fireworks can do, ie. image slicing, scripting, and exporting to Dreamweaver, get only a cursory overview in the last 30 pages. Regular users of graphics software, should probably look elsewhere for a more advanced title."
2,Solid overview of e-Learning fundamentals,"Kruse and Keil cover a broad range of topics in this book. The authors provide an overview of available learning technologies, advice on how to tailor learning materials to different audiences, and tips on layout.The nicest part of this book is the section on selling projects internally, which I also found useful as a guide to selling projects externally. The authors discuss the selling process, which benefits to emphasize, and how to quantify cost benefits of technology based training.In short, the book provides a introductory overview of the leaning technologies that exist, some tips on how to get the most from various technologies, and advice of getting buy-in from stakeholders."
2,Culturally pleasing...,"In the album, El Milagro de Guadalupe, SAVAE clearly demonstrate their ability to cross-cultures and to unite or fuse the commonalities without difficulty. The sacred music somehow seems so much more holy in this context. The vocalists are quite talented singers and linguists. Overall a very pleasant cd and would recommend it to others."
1,too cute,"I found the characters in this story just too cute to be believable. Jane and Nick living in a roach-infested apartmentand they're rehearsing a play which he is about to appear. Laying on the floor, his head on her belly, I could just puke.I think Susan Issacs went to far with this one."
2,Great Game For a Great Console!,I love this game! The gameplay is simple although it does take about a half hour to get used to the (great) controls. The graphics are A-W-E-S-O-M-E! The character detail is AMAZING. I could actually tell who the player was just by looking at him! I couldnt do that in any other soccer game before. Also the character animation is very realistic. This game is also fun for multiplayer purposes. I had a great time playing this game with my friends. There are some new teams to unlock but not enough to satisfy my needs for unlockables.Oh yeah by the way: GO GERMANY!!!I hope that helped.
1,Poorly edited,"Although the list of recipes is varied, the actual recipes are poorly written, inaccurate in measurements, and confusing. Many sentences are cut-off and end abruptly. The book badly needs an editor who actually reads the contents of the work."
1,"not very inspiring, lacking in expression","The interpretation of this great music leaves much to be desired. Inability to play romantic legato, especially in chord sections, constant ignoring pianissimo signs, and inability to play anything in a truly expressive manner - all these add to a very pale interpretation. Choice of tempos is poor. The pianist seems to get excited only in forte passages. Even my Bose system did not help.Or, maybe it is all the fault of Naxos and their microphones?"
1,Disappointed,"I have always believed that Stork Craft made great furniture for toddlers and babies, however I order this bed TWICE and the parts were either nicked, unpolished, or scratched. It took the TWO bed to make one decent one. I am still not satisfied but I do not want to keep taking this large boxed bed back to UPS. I am keeping this bed only because my grandson needs a bed and I can't keep waiting for a replacement which will probably end up like the first one. A quality assurance person is need to check this product before shipping. I am disappointed even more than I am unsatisfied."
1,Blood & yawn,This movie had the potential to be grotesque but unfortunately didn't quite cut it with the special effects. It had some mildly erotic moments but just didn't make it as a horror movie. If the actors had been Muppets in stead it could have been a killer comedy.
1,Nice Screen; Good Features; Terrible Build Quality,"I was convinced this would be a great notebook. Very good features for the price. The screen is really quite amazing. However, from the start, the computer feels a bit on the cheap side. The battery jiggles a little in its housing, giving the whole computer a somewhat ramshackle feel... as if it is about to break... and lo, it did... multiple times so far. Sony really needs to work on the build quality.I was happy for the first two weeks, then my problems began.1. 2 weeks into owning it, the computer wouldn't turn on without a reset of holding the power button for 30 seconds.2. 4 weeks in, the DVD-RW drive started to work intermittently, then not at all.3. 8 weeks in, the power gave out completely. The machine won't turn on.Sony's in-home service has been OK (will have my 3rd visit this week), but waiting 2-4 days for service has been incredibly inconvenient."
1,Don't think it really works.....,"I've used this both last winter and the previous one because my Chihuahua doesn't really care much for his boots. I have found, that even after ""globbing"" this stuff on, he will still lift his leg and let out a little screech in stinging pain from the salt. If that doesn't break your heart I don't know what will! It also seems to come be worn off by the time we're a only a block down the road! Unfortunately, I think boots are the way to go. No questions asked. Perhaps if you live in a more rural area (not a city polluted with ridiculous amounts of salt), this stuff may be a little more efficient."
1,Just a really boring book.,"As a huge Dan Simmons Fan...I was eager to read this one.Well guess what?....Nothing happens!A guy who went to the moon once...hangs out with a younger girl, his old NASA pals, tries to repair his relationship with his adult son, goes hiking, goes to funeral, and takes a helicopter ride.There ya go, now you dont have to struggle through this, like I did."
1,The worst propadanda piece I have ever seeen,"I can't believe this! I have seen portions of this slick propaganda piece repeatedly because it is sponsored by WALMART themselves. That is like writing an honest autobiography--it just does not happen. So for once, the little people get out a few truths on this corporate giant in their own grassroots efforts and that documentary is overshadowed by this powerful, slick advertising gimmick. Not worthy of critical analysis, avoids issues of human cost! On and on!"
1,WHAT THRILLER? Ain't no thriller here. Dead boring here.,"I have tried 3 James W. Hall books, Buzz Cut, Under Cover of Daylight, Body Language. None of them held my interest. There was nothing in the stories or the characters to get a grip and hold on too. Nothing! Conversations are sluggish, strained, monotone, as are all the characters. Minuscule action/reaction. Florida?, wouldn't know it by his books. I do not recommend this book_Under Cover of Daylight_or any of James W. Hall's books.I recommend Dennis Lehane's _Prayers for Rain_ or _Gone Baby Gone_ if you want to read a REAL thriller"
2,"Difficult to work through, but worth the time","The style of the the Reasoned Schemer is quite unique - at times refreshing yet at other times frustrating. I don't know if this is the best format to present the material, as I often wished for a little prose or some sidebars to help me understand things. While I can certainly imagine other ways the book could have been written, I can say that as frustrating as the book can be, I was able to understand the concepts, and perhaps at a depth that my imagined alternative would have gotten me. Until such an alternative exists to evaluate, I'll recommend the Reasoned Schemer to anyone who wants to dive deeply into logic programming."
1,Smashed after three weeks.,"I read all the reviews about this brush, and I thought it would be the greatest thing ever. It was not. If you like having your scalp destroyed by bristles that don't have any little balls on the end, then this is the brush for you. I foolishly believed the hype about the anti-static properties of this brush as I ignored the fact that rubbing two insulators together creates static elecricity unless one is connected to a grounding strap. All joking aside, this brush is not worth $22, and I would not recommend it."
2,Bank for fun and saving,"I love to use this bank when I give my grandson money. He has had it for over four years and still has fun saving. When it gets full at about 10.00 , the money is put into a bigger container and then he has a new empty bank for learning coin counting and getting the rest of the relatives to dig into their pockets. Lots of fun."
2,Made life much easier..,I recently wired my living room for a Samsung LN46A750 and Klipsch Synergy Quintet SL/SUB-12 entertainment system and for $30 you can save yourself a huge nightmare. I ran all the wire and cables through the walls and ceiling and I couldn't have done it without this tool.
1,I dont recommend this!,"Please don't waste your money on this lousy CD. Bo Bice sounds like all the other lounge singers, nothing special and he's trying too hard with Inside Your Heaven. He's not versatile and simply does not relate the song beautifully at all."
1,WHAT THE,"I KNOW IT THIS MOVIE WAS ALL THE HOT SEX.AND STEVE MARTIN HA,HA THIS IS THE FIRT STEVE MARTIN MOIVE I DID NOT LIKE."
2,Every song a delight. Treasure this CD!,"This CD has outstanding renditions of love songs, sung with feeling and style that only Shirley Horn can sing."
2,Still made in Britain,"I added these bowls to my existing set. The are a perfect match and are still made in England, as the rest of my Portmeirion dishware. This is important to me. They are a excellent sized small bowl."
1,Dung heap,"Throw this one on top of the dung heap, throw on a gallon of diesel, light it and sell tickets to watch. There's an income stream for ya."
1,"Interesting concept, but no story.","I must confess some disappointment with this book. It had an interesting, if terrifying premise, essentially being that America lost WW II and the Eastern half was occupied by the Germans and the Western half by the Japs. The book started by describing life under these circumstance, but then made only an abortive attempt of telling a story, concluding with a ""and then I woke up"" sort of ending. Disappointing. Also,from a historical point of view, it also gives too much credit to Roosevelt, saying that only he kept the US from rolling over and surrendering, which is an absolute absurdity."
1,Will this work in your work area?,"I really could have used something like this, as I have several health issues, and LOVE cooking. I thought this product was truly the answer for the ""resting"" periods I had to take during prepping and making dinners.I was wrong. My husband assembled it with ease, and we adjusted it to my height. But as soon as I tried to roll on our hardwood floors, it immediately marred them.The wheels just aren't correct, or constructed well.I've returned to product, and am awaiting credit.(P.S. It needed to be returned via U.S. Postal Service (over $13.00), rather than by UPS Ground.)"
1,Eating Glass,"Playing through the first decade of chapters is horrendously boring. It is as if I am starving and eating glass. I want to like this game so much, but gameplay is nothing I was expecting at all. If you are new to the series and are expecting a lot in the form of an RPG or adventure-esque type, look elsewhere or wait until Versus comes out.The map is pretty much linear with a trail and some enemies in the way. Not much for exploration or environment interaction. I have not yet finished the game, nor can I stand to put it back into the PS3. It's sad to see a waste of $60 and even worse the disappointment of the game itself. I wish I could return it and just wait for Versus.FYI, playing the game for the story line isn't worth it either. Go watch a korean sci-fi drama instead."
1,Catwoman or Bugwoman?,"I must admit that the movie had a good plot and there's no doubt that Halle Berry looks good in the outfit. After that, it pretty much went downhill.I'm not knocking special effects in general, but there is a point where too much is too much. And the ones used to simulate her movement were just too much. Crawling all over the walls? Last time I checked, cats do not possess that particular ability. Her debut in the jewelry store was hilarious. We couldn't stop laughing ... and I don't think that's what the director had in mind.If you're looking for a film with a good looking woman in a skimpy costume or enjoy making fun of movies then you'll be happy with this. Otherwise I would recommend passing this one up."
2,Another 5 Stars for Leslie,"Thanks again Leslie.I liked Leslie West's music for years, but starting with PHAT it turned to love. PHAT was great, but Blues to Die For, Got Blooze, and now Blue Me are fantastic. It is just my kind of blues; slow and deep.Blue Me follows Leslie's last few entries; all covers. This is fine with me. No need to re-invent the wheel. Just do the greats as only the greatest can do them. Keep'em coming Leslie, keep'em coming.The samples do not do this CD justice."
1,just skip to track two,"just skip to track two,listen enjoy,and then put on something else,maybe recoil,or pigface,or jared and the aliens.anything but this studio disaster."
1,Don't Buy this book,"just simple fact. This book is a badly organized MFC reference.I prefer using MSDN MFC refernce to this book.If you want to learn about how MFC works try ""inside visual c++ 5.0""by David Kruglinsky ( no 6.0 version after his death) with""Programming Windows"" by Petzold ( for win 32 api and basic drawing)."
2,Stargate Ultimate Edition,"I highly reccomend this particular edition. I still watch this movie at least once a month. I have the entire Stargate SG-1 Series, as well as the Stargate: Ark of Truth movie. I am a big fan and if you like Stargate at least as half as much as I do, please consider Stargate Ultimate Edition. I doubt you'll be disappointed. I wasn't and I love the movie, and the creation of the series."
1,Company sent wrong product,I ordered this product but received advantix for dogs over 55 pounds. Thank goodness I noticed before using on my 5 pound chihuahua. I sent an email to the company 3 weeks ago through amazon and still haven't heard back!
2,Sea Monkeys are back and better than ever!!,"This is one of the best sea-monkey kits ever! It comes with everything you need to start your own sea-monkey colony. It also has great landscaping unlike the Ocean-Zoo tanks that only have landscaping at the bottom. If you are looking for a pet that requires minimal care, this is it, It's a must buy!!"
1,decent at best,"I used this for about 2-3 years before it broke when crushing a clove of garlic. I was squeezing down pretty tight when, bam, the metal just broke. I also have to say that it was always a pain to put in the diswasher b/c whenever I took it out, water would leak out of the handles from in between the metal and the black plastic coating. I'm not a fan."
1,A good introduction.,But that's probably about the extent of what can really be said about it. I think this more-or-less meant to be a coffee table book as it contains a lot of photos. The author deals with the subject matter in a sort of superficial way that doesn't really delve too deep into the motives behind the use of certain principles - thankfully that subject matter can be found in other books. The one thing I took away from the book was merely an understanding that their were practices in many cultures around the world that dealt with putting the spiritual symbolically into their architecture.
2,My favourite English novel,"When you start reading the book you do not understand anything , but then more and more the fictual world is building up in your mind. The main character a boynamed Jonas is a little bit out of the ordinary . So for example he csn see things others can't.He lives in a ""preconditioned"" world where people are not supposed to do their own decisions . Later he becoms the Receiver of his community . That means he will be after his training the leader of the Elders a committee that leads the community . And last but not least there is a rule for everything even for things like the age when children get their bikes . All in all ""The Giver"" is a very interesting novel that by the way was awarded with the Newbery Medal and other important prizes . But I think you have to make up your own opinion so buy it , read it , like it ."
2,A great grill;,"I really like this grill because of the convenience and ease of use. I used this grill all winter long and it performed wonders. The set up took minutes and you do not need tools to put it together or to take it apart. It heats up quickly; the food cooks quickly and clean up is a breeze. I like how big the dome cover is because you can put a whole chicken on the grill and forget it.It is great to have a barbeque through out the winter because it makes winter seem less depressing. This is a great feeling.What I do not like; it eat a lot of power, some times causing my circuit box to trip and there is no rack to keep certain foods warm while others cook like a traditional out door grill. It is electric. There is nothing like a charcoal flame for barbequing.People who have harsh winter and who live in apartments and can appreciate this grill.Enjoy"
2,Works for me!,"Plenty of content in the reviews below. I enjoyed the cutting-edge medical content. Pretty close to what I've been reading in the medical journals, and the story around which that topic is wrapped provides an interesting vehicle.It's always interesting to read the opinons of others - especially on the same topic. Some folks obviously got worked up over this book. Make up your own mind...it's well worth the time."
1,Lives of the Pretentious and Fermented,"Whining pretentious ""special"" child of insufferable ugly american francophiles, (names dropped here), fails utterly at journalism career, but goes home to write book (more names dropped here) supposedly about the life in a vineyard/winery. Between the descriptions of her cool clothes and wonderful parties she finds a little time to run to the chais to ask her wine maker husband basic questions about wine making, that she then inserts into her partylogue as if she knows which end of a corkscrew is up. For pure unadulterated masochism try reading this out loud, preferably to someone who loves you and has a black sense of humor. If an editor has ever seen this book, I would be highly surprised."
2,Zits,"Whether you have raised a teenage boy (or girl) or not, you will find the character of Zits to be hilariously funny and totally endearing."
1,Lacking in some important fundamentals,"I've used Paint Shop Pro 8 for only a couple of months before I bought this book. I was seldom interested in using it for advanced stuff - commonly called ""bells and whistles"". I was only using it for simple stuff. I just wanted to know why some so-called ""tools"" and stuff ""disappear"" just when I need them, especially the Font selection and font size tool when I want to insert plain text. Two short paragraphs on page 315 do not help. And other paragraphs which mention how to use the ""View"" options to select various tools, palettes and such did not help either; I already knew about those. And ""starting from scratch"", so to speak, and following the detailed instructions on adding text, did not help either. What a waste of my money, not to mention the added aggravation."
1,Pull-ease,"I'm with the reviewers who thought this book was ruined by the ending. I'm all for twists, but this was completely ridiculous and incongruous and dumb.The book tells the tale of Hamptons small-time lawyer Tom, who had a brief career as a professional ball player. Apparently sometime in his youth, he dumped the woman he truly loved, Kate, who became a hard career lawyer in NYC. We know she's hard because she smokes, and has no friends, but in the end, they band together and find true love while defending a young black ball player from a multiple murder death-penalty charge.It's twisting and turning and super derivative, but mostly it's satisfying. Until the last few chapters, when the writers throw in a major monkey wrench that turns the books into a joke.I felt as if the entire reading experience was false, and a waste of time. Badly done. Cheap.Patterson's books may not be the best, but they ususally don't make you feel this cheated."
2,An American Who Knows Israel Amazingly Well,"As an Israeli living in New York, I read this book and learned a lot about my own country, about realities that I knew but never focused on so clearly. Wendy Orange got under the skin of my homeland and inside the Palestinian territories too. I didn't think an American could teach me about Israel. Well, wrong I was!This is one great writer, very smart. As for the Palestinians, she, I'm sad to say, knows more about them then most Israelis do. This is a great learning experience from a really fair writer. Read this book."
1,Not a good match for windows 98se,"I was able to install the modem on my old Dell machine with windows 98se and access the internet. However, I could not reboot the machine without removing the TRENDnet modem. I returned the Modem for a full refund."
1,Nah.,"Too bad as I heard good things about this author but for myself, I found the writing slow. Read it because it was our group's selection but I was not thrilled with this book. Kept waiting for something to happen. Boring. Doubt I'll read another one by Tey."
2,"Great reference for writers and, well, everybody else too","Want to brush up on philosophy? Want to know - in 10 seconds - what's the big deal with Mark Twain? Want a quick answer to a question about the political system of Mexico? This is the book for you. Incredibly accessible, quick reading, and just thorough enough, it's a great resource for writers and a VERY cool book for anyone just wanting to get past the headlines of the newspaper (""just what IS Hinduism, anyway?""). Get it and watch your IQ points go up a notch or two, or, if nothing else, be able to nudge into that water cooler conversation with authority."
2,The Sea Hunters,"This book was great, as always with this author. Even more so since the stories were based on fact."
1,Obsolete theory,"This book was seminal in its time as the first to propose that trade relations were the ultimate cause of the wars fought among the Eastern Woodland tribes of North America in the 17th century. This theory, based primarily on marxist concepts of trade being a fundamentally evil activity at the source of many conflicts, has been largely discredited today.For a better overview of this subject, check out the Iroquois Wars I & II, available from Amazon.com, which offer excerpts from the primary sources themselves and tell a much different story from Mr. Hunt's faulty interpretation."
2,Perfect.,I purchassed these as a gift and the person loved them. Visitors compliment the style and look.I would definitely purchase again.
1,A dud of a novel,"As cheesy as the cover is, the innards are even more cheesier. Talking zombies, poor descriptions and dialogue. Where was the editor? Did he even read this book or buy it because it was a zombie book? I'm giving it two stars for effort. Even the plot didn't hold up well--a scary book makes people rise up from the dead. Adn who does the book belong to? THE DEATHBRINGER! It should be titled the DEATHGO-AWAYER."
2,In Wal-Mart's $5 bin!,"I found this in Wal-Mart's $5 bin (I know, I know, I shouldn't shop there...you are probably right but hey, they have that $5 bin). It was well worth $5! Some of the stuff is really funny and awfully strange. ""Child Bride"" is right out of the headlines here (close to the Polygamy Capital of Texas). Most of the movies are exploitation flicks probably originally presented as having some sort of medically or morally redeeming value--they don't. Anyway, if you are into strange old movies, splurge and don't wait to find this box in that $5 bin--go ahead and spend the whole $8.47. ""Child Bride"" alone is worth that."
2,Good value,Seems to be everything it claimed to be. After using I would prefer a swivel top to steady it while using
1,Wrong description,"Same problem as previous poster. It was supposedly 17.75 in. in length, which is what I required, but when I got the part, it was only 15.25 in. in length. A whole 2.5 in. less than what it stated and what I needed. Whoever is putting up the specifications should actually look at the part before they type in random numbers. The part may have been fine, but it does one no good if it doesn't fit as it is described."
1,Blu Ray Problems with Audio and Special Features,"This is a review of the blu ray itself and not of the film Inception.First and foremost, the audio cuts out and becomes out of sync on my Blu Ray player (Samsung BDP 1600). This usually happens during the opening of the heist scene when they arrive in the warehouse.Secondly, the behind-the-scene features cut off prematurely.Beyond these technical problems, the Inception Blu Ray is disappointing due to its poor navigation and lack of truly interesting special features. The navigation is slow and confusing due to its many nested layers and silly animation.It's a shame that such a great film was presented in such an unprofessional way. I suggest renting this edition and waiting for an improved subsequent edition of the Blu Ray disc."
1,"BEWARE, if you remember this cologne, it is not the same","This cologne originally was made in FRANCE , if you liked it, that's when it was, WHAT is was !!! todays gray flannel scent is made in USA, the fragrance seems the same but changes have been made to its body, this is due to USA restriction of ingredients it contained, which changed the chemistry and resulted in a far less superior scent."
2,All Myst Games are Great,"I have all of the Myst Games and enjoy each very much. I am very much looking forward to the End of Ages... the graphics are super in all Myst worlds and books, and the puzzles are very challenging. One has to focus on every detail and don't leave any stone unturned!"
1,Don't bother,"Don't bother with this. Where it is good at the start, the laser became quite dim very quickly and i just ripped it down and threw it away. A complete waste of $20. I now have a very high tech ball at the end of a string hanging from my garage ceiling--total cost less than $1.00."
2,cleanest rock instrumentals around,"the ventures were true musicians. Unfortunately for some critics, they left out the grunge in their takes on many songs and replaced it with clean, professional, well arranged songs. The driving rhythm and tight drums were present on all their stuff. Definitely more studio than garage!!"
2,$24.07 just as good as jars of gourmet olives,I ordered this after realizing my family was buying tiny jars of Greek olives at $4 a pop and I had all these little glass jars to recycle. This big bag is a better value and the quality is very good. Not every olive was perfect but more than 90% is pretty good.
2,"Pictorial Guide to Fun, Creative and Challenging Writing","Read the book just like a magazine. Seeing & Writing is packed with stunning images including cartoons, posters, news captions, studio portraits, studio arts and illustrations. The title is pretty self-explanatory. Seeing and writing: The book encourages us to see, to examine, to observe, to scrutize, to pay attention to small details and so to inspire a more complete and fun writing experience. The book also adopts pieces that leave us agape, in a way that we can re-discover how we could write about an even occurs in a nick of time as a small frog being swallowed by a bug-eater. You will be amazed at how detailed, descriptive, lively some of the selections found in the book. Re-discover our life experience, re-discover our writing. Write like we have never written before. See & Writing is truly inspiring."
2,A great story that keeps you interested.,This novel is similiar to all of the FBI series in the good versus evil storyline and the romance vein keeps is interesting as well.
1,Sizing is TOTALLY OFF!,"I ordered the petite size 90-135 Pounds. I weigh 120 pounds and am at 28 weeks. I figured by the time I reach the end of my pregnancy I would be at or under 135 pounds (my end weight goal is 130-135 pounds according to my Dr.). I just received the prenatal cradle, and I can only hook it to the last notch. Even at the last notch, its super tight! So looks like the sizing is totally off!!!I'll obviously have to return it as there is no way I am going to be able to wear this for the next three months!!! Very unhappy, as I was really looking forward to wearing this belt and having some relief from the constant back pain."
2,have to mount note please take time with this part,must have 2.8 rims to mount up i found some trx rims for eight buck and had hard time glueing to new stlye rimalso clean tire and rim with rubbing achol wipes work fine just clean new or not then glue to rim after drying a min then slide on rim and glue not hard and fun to say you did it all by your self
1,History Book - Not a How too book,"This book is ok if you want a cute little lesson on the BMW2002 series. As to it being a restoration guide, well it leaves a lot to the imagination and very little helpful and practical tips and photos. Save your money and find forums online."
1,Disappointing,"After reading the other reviews on this book, my expectations were very high. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed, this book focused repeatedly on the fact that squatting is the best postion for giving birth and not much else. The yoga exercises were handy, but compared with the other reviews this book was given, I was expecting more substance."
2,RUN OUT AND BUY THIS CD TODAY - MUST BUY,"You will absolutley not be disappointed. Especially with her version of the hit song ""Don't Speak"" by No Doubt... she did a excellent job with that song."
1,Disappointing,"This story was by no means a mystery . How V.I. keeps being a friend to Lotty IS a mystery . Now that her past has been revealed , maybe she can stop being so nasty to everyone .I had looked forward to this book ; am glad I got it at the library and didn't waste the money ."
2,Old Story but new for my children,"Read this to my children on Christmas eve, they loved it and we may even make it a Christmas tradition"
1,The new 'EcoLiner' liners in these bottles will peel off!!!,"The new 'EcoLiner' liners in these bottles will peel off!!! At first I thought I had a piece of debris, hair or something in my bottle, then I realized it was from the bottle itself. I tugged at it a little and the yellowish liner of the bottle peeled right out of the threads. The chance of ingesting this peeling is very good. Worse for you than a little BPA, I'm guessing... Don't buy a Sigg!!"
2,How Do You Say Musically Perfect?,"Dan was the most talented person in music and this best of type CD brings the real Dan out perfectly.All his hits are here as well as some excellent new stuff. The Love In Your Eyes should have been a #1 single and could be Dan's best song of all time.Whether you love pop,dance or rock grab this Cd because Dan could do it all and do it all well.Vertigo itself is worth the price of this CD!"
1,Predictable and Disappointing,"Had this been my first Clancy novel it most certainly would have been my last. I've read and enjoyed all his previous work and looked forward to this one as well.Instead I found it predictable, shallow on detail, short on intrigue and just short in general.Lets hope his next work is up to par with the previous work,"
2,An excellent book...,"...not a classic in the same sense as The Good Earth, but wonderful reading nonetheless. Pearl Buck had a way of telling stories and drawing characters like no one else. One is always sorry when the book comes to a close, and we wish we could be swept out of our chair and into wherever Mrs. Buck's stories take us. Tzu-Hsi was a fascinating woman that the reader can come very close to in this telling while also wondering what kind of human being she truly was. This book is well worth reading; in fact ANYTHING by Pearl Buck is rewarding and transporting."
1,Great movie lousy Blu-Ray,"Great movie but I was extremely disappointed in this supposedly Blu-Ray edition. It isn't even close to HD let alone Blu-ray quality. Looks like a regular ""small screen"" dvd (that's right it isn't widescreen) and has only the black & white version unlike many other quality blu-ray editions of classic movies that have both the BW and color versions.So do yourself a favor and don't waste you money on this ""blu-ray"" version."
2,Lizzie McGuire Movie,"This was a great movie. It's better for fans, but enjoyable for anyone else. Hilary Duff, Adam Lamburg, and all the other characters did an awsome job. Very nice plot in my opinion, and the ending was great, especially for fans."
1,Confusingly pretty,"I'm not a fan of the Final Fantasy games, so this film was not a trip into a familiar fantasy world for me. I DID see the previous deeply flawed ""Final Fantasy"" motion picture. Like that film, this one has a number of story and pacing problems.I tried. I really did. I have a number of friends who absolutely LOVE the FFVII game that this film expands upon. I'm afraid it just didn't keep my attention.Sure, the animation is top notch, and many of the film's moments are arrestingly unique; but I just never connected to the dozen or so central characters. Too many subplots, too many characters, no central focus to the story."
2,This recording is spellbinding.,"Sir Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony are at the absolute height of their powers in this phenomenal recording from 1971. This is (no exaggeration) surely one of the most incredibly accurate and exhilirating orchestral performances put on disk, and the soloists (including masters like Lucia Popp and Arleen Auger) could not have been bettered. This is one of my most treasured disks, and it makes the piece sound like one of the great choral/orchestral works of all time."
2,Outstanding among movie collections,"Nary a dud in this set, unlike most star-based box sets. No less a tribute to the virtues of the studio system than to Grant, this set has something for everyone from this multi-faceted preformer.And in such a lovely package! It acts as a beatiful theater home to these fine pictures.(Nyah, nyah, I have Holiday and all you grousing sour pusses don't.)"
1,"Perfect for a prop, thats about it.","This should be $30.00 at the most. The wood looks real good, but its hardly funtional. If you put any heavy clothing on it, it will tip over. Its rickety. It has horrible plastic casters on it, which make it look cheap. It doesnt come with any spare parts so yer screwed if your phillips head brakes thru the cheap cams. I had to get a 3 inch screw to fasten it. I should of returned it, before i broke it."
2,Great size and accuracy.,This scale is perfect for weighing quantities of food at a restaurant or at home. It is extremely portable and accurate. It is a great value for the money. I would recommend it to anyone.
2,Very Useful,"This is a must-have in my view for a professional using an impact driver. It allows you to use regular drill bits in your impact driver. It's easy to use and very solid. I've used mine professionally for a few years now, and it's been very effective. It also allows you to use your impact driver as a hammer drill."
2,Corell Dessert Bowl,Finally found these after looking in countless stores. Love the product but the price is a bit steep in my opinion.
1,similar to a lucky rabbits foot,"I totally bought into this book. I even spent a day creating a ""vision board,"" with all the things that I loved and wanted in my life. I posted it where I dressed every morning, and I looked at it, visualizing how the universe would attract those things to me; My girlfriend of three years, a great condo, a new car, my close friends, travel to my favorite cities, my dog and my interest in writing. I followed the instructions, you know?Well, within a year, almost everything in my vision board vanished from my life. I still have the dog, but lost my girl, lost my job, lost my 401K and now I have to relocate to a small town where I'll be away from my friends and won't be affording a car or travel anytime soon. When I think about Oprah and the others shilling this book as such a life changing thing, it just makes me angry.I submit that the real ""Secret"" is that the book is itself a strong repellant for good fortune and happiness."
2,You've got this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I totally love this cd I am a new fan of Janet's this is the first cd I have gotten of her cd's.Now I can't wait to hear all of her other cd's I know that they are rated PG compaired to this.But this was a great step hopefully this will lead to many more and great cd's like this.I love this it is the best cd of this year so far.
1,DOWN COMES THE MOUNTAIN,"Considering the premise has already been utilized in a movie called AVALANCHE, this little movie isn't all that bad but it's far from classic cinema.A new condominium complex is endangered by irresponsible blasting and since there is a villain out to keep his name clean, the resulting landslide is not a surprise. Once again, we have a hero who is estranged from his wife and son, and a corporate biggie who is the wife's daddy, too. Everything pretty much goes as expected and unfortunately the special effects are pretty inadequate.For disaster movie freakos, this one's passable."
1,Not my bag,"This is another of those books that either goes over my head or somewhere else off target. While not especially verbose, for this sort of material, I just can't get excited about detailed discussion of stuff that does not really seem relevant to either making or appreciating photography, or any other art form, for that matter. Not of practical use to photographers."
2,A FRESH TAKE ON THE BATMAN,"The Batman: Complete First Season is the Batman in year 3 of his crime fighting days. He's meeting villains such as Joker, Mr. Freeze, Penguin, Catwoman for the first time. This first season is very well done. The animation is cutting edge, the stories are fresh, the new visions of the main villains work extrememly well. All characters are given a 21st century make over and they could not of done a better job. Kudos to Warner Bros.Some of the stand out episodes are:TractionThe Man Who Would Be BatThe Big ChillBig DummyBird Of PreyAny Batman fan will enjoy this series. Do not compare this series with Batman: The Animated Series as both are great visions of Batman. Any true fan of Batman will like both versions. A great addition to any aminated collection. Highly Recommended. Look forward to Season 2. Great job DC!A loyal fan."
2,beautiful ring!!,I love this ring! it looks as good as the picture. I've always wanted a ring like this. Thanks so much.
1,These people are still making music?,It would be more interesting to hear Speedy West and Hazel Dickens team up. I dare you to evolve in your listening.
2,"Puffed Rice - plain, simple, good, and cheap","Just like the old days. I've loved PR for years. Found this product in a store by the same manuf. It was on sale, once, at 3/$6. Next time it was $3 each. I paid $11.88 for the case of 12 less than a month ago and see the price is now nearly 50% more. Still, all in all a good bargain, even now, at about $1.40 ea."
2,Comfortable boots,Great boots - not quite as comfortable as a pair of lace up Ariat's that I own but still great boots.
2,"A charming, quirky, low-budget comedy!","I picked this up on a whim from the clearance bin at a local video store, and I was very pleasantly surprised! This little film was plainly a labor of love for its creators -- unknown actors, low-budget, and a story line that's waaaay off the beaten path. It's also witty, touching and very funny!There have been a number of harsh reviews here saying that this is either (take your pick) a commercial for the Mormon church or an exercise in Mormon/Baptist bashing. Bunk. It's a low-key, personality-based comedy and a perceptive look at small-town America. I assure you no Mormons or Baptists were harmed during the making, or viewing, of this film.If you'd enjoy a little, well-written, down-home comedy/romance that's safe for the entire family, then I recommend Baptists At Our Barbecue!"
2,Don't know much about the Civil War?,This is the book for you! Pratt's writing draws you in and on even while he provides you with the difficult to read details of battle movements. He also captures the many personalities of the Civil War in a vibrant way including much humor along the way.I can certainly understand why this is a long standing classic of Civil War history.
1,TSTL-heroine + hot deagon = not a good book,"I wanted to strangle Aisling most of the time. She actually reminded me a bit of Kathryn Janeway in Star Trek Voyager and I don't think she made one sane decision in the whole book. I am sorry, but she totally ruined a book with a lot of potential.I started another book one of Katie MacAlister's books a while ago and returned it after a few chapters and if it hadn't been for a buddy read I probably would have given up. I just wanted to push trough it and that is never a good sign! It reminded me a little bit of ""Ordinary Angels"" but that book was refreshing because there was no TSTL-moments. Just shows you can never trust the ratings!"
2,Factory Records connections abound,"The last three tracks are bonus tracks from the single for ""Searching for Heaven."" New Order's Bernard Sumner plays guitar on that track. Elsewhere, Durutti Column's Vini Reilly plays guitar. Martin Hannett produced, and is a member of the backing band, Invisible Girls. The cover was designed by Peter Saville. This is practically a Factory Records release in all but name."
2,Highly Recommended,"This book makes you think differently about your own thoughts and the fact that they CAN have a direct effect on your and others' environments. I feel most of us already feel this in some way, and I'm gladdened to know that science is catching up with the explanation behind it. I encourage everyone to try thought experiments and become part of this group online that the author has created."
1,"Smells great, didn't work for my dog's issue","I love that this is a natural remedy, but unfortunately my dog thought it tasted great too. I ended up having to take her to the vet to take care of her 'hot spot' issue."
2,FANTASTIC !,"Contrary to *some* reviews, who would like this to be a *tribute to the piano styles of lore*, Marc-andre Hamelin doesn't attempt to mimic ~other~ methods, he plays HIS style, why critics want Hamelin to conform to old school thought is beyond me(it's 2005 for goodness sake!), I'm quite sure he could replicate de Larrocha versions and then we would have one more de Larrocha recording and everyone would be happy."
1,Big Dissapointment,"We were searching for software that would allow us to create our own recipe book. This one does, unfortunately, it is weak in its categorizing ability. For example, we created our book and added a recipe for pie. Then, when you want to view all pie recipies in your book, you are forced to view all pie recipies on the CD. You could create a chapter called ""pies"" - but this is not very flexible (desserts would make more sense).The screen layouts are unpolished and are not user friendly. Try finding Nutritional information (hint: click the list button).Also, the program requires the CD to be in the drive at all times. You should have the option to skip the videos and run the program without the CD."
1,I regret buying these,"My neighbors have similar lights to these that work great. I bought these lights and they do not work. One or two of them light up very dimly for a couple of hours but most of them don't seem to get enough sunlight to light up at all. Either that or they just don't work but I think it's just that they don't get quite as much direct light. I live in California. There is plenty of sunlight. Granted, due to shadows from my house there may not be direct sunlight all day but it's enough for my neighbors lights to work and it should be enough for decent solar lights to function.One of these days I will find out what kind of lights my neighbors have and get the same ones and throw these out. They were a waste of money."
2,good,"item arrived promptly and worked as expected. i would reccomend this product to anyone needing a power cord for such a great deal, Thank you"
2,Scary or not Scary? That is the question.,"This is my first Goosebumps book. I have asked many people about their preference about this book. Most people say it is not even scary, in my point of view it is very scary. It is creepy because I tried putting myself in Hanna's (main character) position. Hannah is not with her friends this summer and a neighbor that just moves in isn't really a neighbor. What could this `neighbor' be?This book also has a weird kick to it. These weird things are surprising creepy. For example, she gives the `neighbor' back his ball but there was no answer after asking several questions. I think that by reading this part is a good preparation to start reading the rest of the Goosebumps book by R.L. Stine."
1,Is this really a dictionary or is it an information book?,This book is all information about a dictionary. Are they stupid? This is not a dictionary it is an informational text. Not a dictionary. I would complain to that company for making a book about a dictionary & calling it a dictionary. Seriously calling a book about a dictionary a dictionary. Who does that? Oh wait it's the people who made this book.Yes I am complaining about this book. Next time this company needs to put some words and definitions to those words.I`m 12 almost 13 and I know the difference between a dictionary and an informational book about a dictionary. I may need reading glasses but I know how to tell what types of books without reading it the title with my reading glasses. I would advise you people who make this book do something to make this book a dictionary.
1,Website description is erroneous,"As of 08/10/10, the Amazon description of this item is inaccurate. It claims to be an 800-page summary of research on polygraphy, when in fact it is a 70-page supplement to a previously issued 800-page volume. Worse, the supplement does not consist of independent text, but only of update paragraphs, sentences, and graphs keyed to the 800-page volume. Since each update lacks the context of the original volume, it's useless unless you own the 800-page book. Be warned.As of 07/30/11, the Amazon description has been updated to clarify that this is the 2002 supplement, but it's still important to know that it's keyed to the original text and can't be read without said original."
2,Cimmaron City,This collection of DVDs from Cimmaron City has made my father a very happy man. He talked about it all the time and couldn't believe he is watching it again. The DVDs are top quality. Dad is a true cowboy at heart! I will be looking for more DVDs from Amazon to complete his cowboy collection.
1,Not the product displayed on EWG!,"This mascara does work, but if you are buying this because of the Environmental Working Group's review of less toxic chemicals, This is not the formula. This product contains the parabens and other stuff."
2,The Best Book I Ever Read,"Sphere is probably the best book I have read. Michael Crichton is a brilliant man. I have never read a book so interesting, scary, funny, and easy-to-read than Sphere. As sci-fi goes, Sphere is a classic work of art."
2,really useful,"I am a fitness professional and currently live in a building that has only single purpose machines. Having exercise tubes is an easy way to add possibly infinite number of exercises to your routine at a good price. I wouldn't pay more than $15 for any exercise tube, but it is a good investment."
1,Very disappointed,"Let me start by saying I really loved ""Thankful"", and Kelly Clarkson all-together, however, I was sadly disappointed with this cd. What I appreciated so much about Kelly Clarkson was her distinct sound that set her apart from the average singer on the radio. She had her own style. What she' done on this album is try to sound like Avril Lavigne, yuk! In my opinion, Kelly went from attracting a 20-30 something audience, with her awesome, strong voice, to strictly teeny-boppers, who are the only ones who could possibly enjoy this cd. Even my husband hated most of it, and asked ""is she trying to be Britney Spears""? on one of the tracks. I kinda like ""Breakaway"", but find the power-ballad after power-ballad annoying. And most of the time, the music drowns her out anyway. The highlight, and best song on the cd is the live version of ""Beautiful Disaster"", from her previous album. I hope this is just a phase. Bring back the soulful, songbird we all love."
1,snooze a rama,"this book is the worst of the 3 in this trilogy. I felt nothing when i read it. i like to hike, but the details of rock climbing totally detracted from this story. i could hardly wait until i was done (i cant stand to start a book and not finish it. i keep thinking there has to be some redeeming value to it). her earlier books are so much better (the swan maiden, etc.). it always seems to happen with good authors. once they attain some popularity, their publishers decide it is time they write about a different venue, because the populace seems to be losing interest. once the author makes an effort to write in that dif. venue, they fail. their sparkle disappears."
2,"Fish Fossil at Hays, KS","Great book! My daughter received this book as part of her 2nd grade curriculum through K12. The book details a specific fish-within-a-fish fossil. The original of this fossil is located at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History at Fort Hays State University located in Hays, Kansas. The museum has also has robotic dinosaurs and is located on I-70 halfway between Kansas City and Denver."
2,An Absolute Masterpiece!,"For me, this album was instrumental in my becoming a singer, based on the structure and lyrical content of the songs selected. Valerie Simpson is absolutely phenominal on every lyric she sings, and Nick Ashford completly wrecks the house in his ""rap"" on ""Over and Over"". However, the opus ""If You're Lying"" closes out what I consider to be the second best album this duo released. BUY THIS CD!"
1,This is a bootleg,"Get the album Que Viva Mingus instead, on Dreyfus records, which is what I assume this is a copy of."
2,It's a must,Not slimy and won't slow you down. This site requires so many words so trying to find something more to say. LOL
2,A read for everyone,I really enjoyed this book & think that everyone should read it just to get another view of the conflicts that have been going on for many years. It opens ones eyes to realize what the inhabitants of the country must endure. The work & endurance of Greg Mortenson is most inspiring. Peace to all of these people.
1,Cute but cold!,"This blow dryer is cute, but has no air blowing power and barely heats to a warm temperature. I gave up trying to dry my hair."
2,Feel The Burn!!,"I just received this video 2 days ago. I did the workout for the first time yesterday and was amazed at how easy it seemed. I thought that it wasnt going to do any good because it seemed so easy. When I woke up this morning I could barely move. Every muscle in my body aches, and that my friends means that this video did its job and more! I recommend this video to anyone who is wanting to burn some fat and tone up their body. I definately look forward to seeing the results that this video will bring over a period of time. Chyna is fun in the video, I told my mom that Chynas attitude in the video makes me think of a boot camp instructor on happy pills. She is tough, but fun. Definately a great buy!"
1,Beware of this pressing,I have Sanderling's other set of Brahms and like it very much. This one has wow and is very much out-of-focus. Very disappointing. (My equipment is first-class.) I'd like to hear from someone who has a clean copy.
1,Give it up Brit!!! You can't Sing!!,"have you heard her sing live? she sounds like a chipmunk...and that's if she EVER sings live...if you want to see a real show with real talent I suggest Madonna... The Drowned World Tour, Re-invention Tour, or any of her other tours!! Madonna Rocks! Britney Sux!"
1,Not exactly what I expected.,"Unfortunately, the digital clear filter had a couple of scratches on it, rendering it useless."
1,*sigh*,This book paled in comparision to the first Deutermann book I read-- Official Privilege. It was pretty disappointing. End of story.
1,Apple Corps. Revolver Rip Off Remaster 2009,"The hype is, they spent four years working on the Beatles catalog to remaster it, yeah,right, what were they doing, smoking dope and taking LSD to while away the time? Because, while Revolver is a great Beatle album, this new CD remaster does not make a big difference over the one issued in 1987 on CD. The liner notes to the new remaster must have been written in ten minutes or cut and pasted from information on the internet. And the bonus in this overhyped remastered Beatle CD is a video that you can only play on your computer. Save your money and wait till this disc ends up in the used CD bin....Oh, one minor difference is that on this CD , McCartney must have told the re-mastering bozos to boost the bass sound. And finally why couldn't they put the mono mix on this cd too? Answer cause Apple is a greedy orgazniation ....."
1,"Don't be fooled by its pretention to ""Art""","This movie is beautifully photographed and well acted and based on a short novel people love. So is it Art? No. It's soft-core faux kiddie porn. The girl is barely a woman -- her thin frame and flat chest turn the nude love scenes between her and a mature man into scenarios of child statutory rape.... If you disagree, consider it without the sexuality. Not much left, is there? (And don't say the sex is necessary. Why wasn't it necessary in American films for the first fifty years?)"
1,I'm too old for this,"This is a book you should read in your teens or even before. As an adult, I found it tedious, obvious and even boring. This is fodder for long conversations between earnest youths, not anything most adults need to waste any time on.Anyone over the age of twenty should have already had every thought Singer expresses here and have come to their own peace with the difficulties of ethics. At the end of the day, most of us realize that we can't ever know enough to judge what is ""right"" or ""wrong""; we can only bumble along doing our best and live with the guilt that our lack of certainty brings.I think Singer just never grew up. If I were ten or eleven, I'd probably treasure this. At sixty-one, it's a complete bore.So: five stars if you are an adolescent exploring your ethical self. Two stars or less for anyone else."
1,Not that much fun.,I don't really care for this book. It would have been better if they had seven letter word only games and maybe games to quiz you on two and three letter words....and there isn't much to this book either...so it could have been bigger. Being called a big book is a big stretch.
2,Best Alarm Clock,I have used this brand and style of clock for over 10 years. Loud alarm. Snooze button. I finally replaced it with this new one and it is wonderful.
2,"One of many ""Unsung"" artists","This cd is hot! But the best thing about it---the seller! I meant to purchase his cd with the song ""This Is My Night"" and mistakenly bought this one:{ The seller was 100% empathetic, returned my money same day, and let me keep this cd! How often will you come across someone like that?---Never! But this cd looks and plays like new, it arrived much earlier than estimated, and although none of these songs match up to the one i thought i was buying, the songs are still hot and he can definitely sing"
1,Terrible,"I've always considered this episode to be one of the worst Trek Classic episodes. The writing is just plain bad (a low point in Jerome Bixby's career. Interesting that he also wrote ""Mirror, Mirror"", one of the best episodes, as well as ""Day of the Dove"" and ""Requiem for Methuselah"", two bright lights in the otherwise dismal third season).The concept of the story is good, but the execution is an embarrassment for Star Trek."
1,Agreed! Definitely a fail!,True Star Wars fans will wait for the true Star Wars. No purchase from me but nice try Lucas! Maybe next time.
1,Depressing,"This is a depressing book.It's entirely about all of our people who were caught and killed....No happy ending, no success stories..EVERYBODY gets killed...a real downer."
2,An upper arm BP device.,This type of BP meter (upper arm meter) was recommended by my doctor to be the most accurate one. So I bought a new HEM-780 BP meter from Amazon and to check the doctor's statement I brought my new HEM-780 BP meter to doctor's office checking my BP parallel to his checking with his professional mercury BP meter device. The readings were very close and I was pleased to have found a reliable BP meter finally.
1,Sloppy Sloppy Sloppy!,"I'm not ready for the exam yet, but already I've picked out numerous typos, goof-ups and errors. Seriously it seems like they didn't even bother to proof read it before printing. The more I read the angrier I get - there's no excuse for this kind of sloppiness in a text that deals with very complicated material, where subtle differences in meaning make a HUGE difference for the exam. I'm tempted just to not finish reading it, it's very difficult to read, worded poorly and circularly, and often just does more to confuse me than help. The full size study guide is much better. Read that first and then approach these exam notes critically, and DON'T rely on them. If in doubt check your facts with other sources, cause this book can't be trusted."
2,Bought it for the Keypad and USB hub,"I love the usb and keypad. That is the main reason why I got it. The mouse however is too small for my liking. I have small hands but the mouse is way too small. I had an extra mouse so it didn't bother me but because my desktop mouse died, I used my extra mouse for that. Leaving me to use the travel mouse. I do like that the wire in the mouse can extend. Too bad the keypad couldn't do that. I got this in May 2008. I used it mostly when I primarily used the laptop (which was about 4 or 5 months). Now, I only use it if I am in school, when I go out of town or if my boyfriend is on my computer."
2,Genius deserves recognition,"This CD is brilliant, original - a must have for any serious Blues/Jazz/African Music collector. Olu Dara merges all three genres with ease and grace."
2,Reinvention at its Best!,It seems like every time Janet releases a new album I feel like I can relate some aspect of my life to the emotions that Janet reveals in her music. I though that Velvet Rope was the most revealing project had ever done. Then I heard All For You. What a great compilation!Janet..you've come along way and as a fan I'm glad for the ride your rollercoaster has treated us to! Thanks for keeping it real... That alone puts you miles above the rest!
2,The size of a small suitcase,"Its larger than I imagined, but it worked great so far.For the price, it looks good too. I would have given it 5 starts if it didn't look like the outside may tear or rip easily if it got caught on something."
1,not satisfied,".Delonghi BG24 Perfecto Indoor Grill,it worked very nicely for the first two months,then just ceased and died,the unit will not heatup."
1,Don't Bother!,The magnets on these things are NEVER strong enough to hold them to a moving car. One pothole and there goes your key. You won't even know it's gone... until the day you lock yourself out and go to look for it.If you want to attach a key to your car use industrial-strength or Extreme Velcro or at least use a keyholder that has a neodymium magnet. Don't make the mistake I did!
1,YES for Fleming - No for bizarre production!,"Another Eurotrash-production ruining a perfectly beautiful opera. With Renee Fleming today's most glorious Rusalka was filmed, sadly not even she can undo what the director did to this beautiful fairy tale."
1,A good book for children w/ no knowledge in robotics.,"The author says that the book is geared towards 7th-12th graders, but the book is far more basic than that. If you don't know a thing about robots or robotics, or would like to interest a child in robotics - this would be a good book to get.If you already know about robotics, and are pursuing it, this would not be a good purchase. The book has no how-to information, only what the robot does.The information in the book is most often a picture and name of a robot, who it was built by, what the robot does, and what sensors it uses. I already knew about every mentioned robot, before I purchased the book just by surfing the internet."
1,Classic styling ain't everything,"Classic styling is fine, but if the radio doesn't get acceptable reception, it means squat! AM or FM reception on this was mediocre at best, & forget any shortwave programming. I added a Terk powered antenna, which didn't help. I bought this radio used on Ebay for my Mom, and I just sold it back on Ebay for a $20.00 loss, but at least it won't be wasting space anymore! By the way, $180.00 list price for this POS?? That is a total joke. You can get 10X the radio brand new for 2/3 the price by buying a Sangean or Roberts Radio unit."
1,What happened to the classic V. C. Andrews style?,"I'm beginning to wonder if the ghost writers ever read the books V. C. Andrews actually wrote herself. These new novels pale in comparision. Aside from the never ending hints about what's going to happen, the book retells most of the story previously lined out in the mini series books. For real fans, its barely worth reading."
2,Very nice,"So I got a new road bike with a Fizik seat. Fizik seats come with a bag clip already built in for a Fizik bag; however, the reviews for the Fizik bag are not good. For this reason, I bought this item. Same concept. It clips in. One of Fizik's weaknesses is that it does not have the the seat post strap like the Aero Wedge. If the clip breaks, the bag will not be lost. I think the medium size is perfect. Not too big, not too small. I highly recommend this product. The Fixer, as they call it, is a very convenient and worthy addition as opposed to the strap only version."
2,How many copies of this album have been sold?!?!,"This album hasn't left the Amazon Top 100 in a year and a half. That pretty much speaks for itself right there. This album is a strong effort by the Chicks. It's right up there with ""Home"", but I don't feel it's as strong as ""Fly"" or ""Wide Open Spaces"". That certainly doesn't take away from this album. Those 2 afformentioned albums are borderline masterpieces. ""Taking The Long Way"" isn't quite a masterpiece, but it's a very good album. More polished, more mature, more adult-oriented subject matter and themes. It's part of the evolution, and I'm glad to see the Dixie Chicks survived the backlash the media created. Yes, the media created it. Ask 100 people if they support the Dixie Chicks and what they said, and you'll get 90 ""Yes"" answers. However, the media portrayed them as poison. You can fool the American public for awhile, but not indefinitely. Rock on, Chicks!"
2,awesome bike rack,"i have been very happy with this bike rack... i have not traveled far, so i do not know how it does, but locally, it is nice.."
1,"Not worth even the shipping fee, which was free","This product is very low end quality. Mine broke in less than a week. It would no longer count steps. Overall, even if it managed to work longer than a week, the way that the interface works makes it fairly useless for going back and looking at prior walks as it is either difficult or impossible to get all of the data about the walks beyond the number of steps.Overall, I'd rate this product as not worth anything to a serious walker. Nothing is worse the getting half way done with ones walk only to discover that the pedometer isn't recording anything."
2,God and America,"""Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silent, and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth."" (Isaiah 62:6-7)"
1,Too Many Forced Previews,"The cartoons are okay, but I don't really care for all the previews. I have to hit the next button severl times before I can get to the main menu and if I don't do this I will end up owning the entire Disney library."
1,Lazy effort - waste of time,"What a shocking recording. Having seen Sade in concert once, and watched a couple of video recordings I know her bands (in the past) can really play. But this is a few years on now, and its really stale. Live recordings need to be recorded really well to make them worthwhile and this is flat as a pancake. The audience sound levels are so annoying - it wrecks the CD for me. If you wanna try a live album worth the purchase, try Eryka Badu ... now we are talking.Sade records next to nothing. When she does release something expectations are high. This is pure lazyness, and cashing in on the past.Bin it."
2,The Proof is in the Pudding As They Say...,"...and this ""pudding"" can be judged by the amount of romance it can conjure up between a couple. I have owned this cd for a few years now and feel a need to rise to its defense after reading the only other review posted here.This music has transported myself and a partner straight into romance-land every time with the combination of musical excellence and variety of songs. Whether or not some of the music has been on other compilations is irrelevant; if you haven't been exposed to those others don't worry-this baby is the real deal! It is a terrific blend of lounge/chill/samba sounds that make the perfect background for entertaining and/or romantic encounters. Give it a try."
2,"Guns, Germs, and Steel","This is a well produced documentary that will give one a good sense of what Jarred Diamond covers in much greater detail in his book of the same title. If you liked the book, you'll enjoy the DVD and vice versa. I have thoroughly enjoyed both. Any student of history will find these concepts fascinating. The visual portrayal on the DVD really brings Dr. Diamond's concepts to life in a very captivating way."
2,Supernanny season one dvd,This was great fun to watch for me and my family. I love the supernanny and I love learning from her. The bloopers were funny.I can't wait to buy season 2.
1,Not so Enchanted Arms,"With a unique battle system and a huge plethora of characters to choose from this title seems like it can't miss. However, within the first 5 min of the game you quickly realize that this is ""my first RPG."" the story seems compelling, for about an hour, then the mundane side stories kick in and is only fit for ""filler"" use. the ""twists"" are pretty much non-existant, and I found myself finishing it only because I bought it. All in all, there is little to love, save maybe the collection of the different usable battle characters. If you find yourself in a ""gotta catch 'em all"" kind of month, then by all means pick it up, but I suggest that you wait for a solid RPG to blow in."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD, it is defective","I ignored the other reviewers and bought this disk. Oops! They are right, there is a obvious buzz running through every song. I cannot believe that they still sell this. What a shame, I really wanted a collection from her!"
1,"Boring, Too Much ""Philosophy""","After reading ""Its Not About The Bike"" (a great book) I had really high expectations for this. Unfortunately, this book really disappointed me. There were some interesting notes from the 2001-2002 tours, but a lot of the book was just the same ""carpe diem"" philosophy over and over and over. The stories about the race and the team were good, but way too much filler in this book."
1,Worse than Britney Spears...and that's saying something!,"Ugh! This girl makes Britney Spears sound like Mariah Carey. Her voice is HORRIBLE. Still, the teenies love it, I guess. As said on MTV.com, ""Critiqing Mandy Moore is a little like critiquing the weather. It's something that HAS to happen, like it or not."" Could not have said it better myself. Why junk like this sells is beyond me. All it is really is a childish, little-girl voice singing along to stupid tunes with even stupider lyrics. ""I'm missin you like candy""? What's that all about? If you want young female pop singers who can SING, I reccomend Jessica Simpson and Christina Aguilera."
1,DVD skips,"The DVD was listed as ""like new"" but the DVD skips and it came in a strange case. The first disc in the case skipped terribly. The first episode played with a few skips, but the second and third episodes were not worth trying to watch. It skipped every 10 seconds. As for the case, it wasn't the orgiinal - it is made of cheaper material, the front cover was taped on, and it holds 8 DVDs, not 6. None of the DVDs fit neatly into the case."
2,Excellent new research on psychoactive fungi!,"Jochen Gartz is a brilliant mycologist from the former East Germany. In this groundbreaking, eclectic new work he presents a wealth of recent discoveries on psilocybian mushrooms along with historical material previously unavailable.A must-have for any serious student of mycology, Gartz includes details on mushroom tourist trades, distribution of species, and the first successful cultivation experiments with species such as P. semilanceata. Highly recommended!"
2,Never gonna give you up,"This was a really good movie. Some scenes were on the quiet side but you could still follow it. I thought the acting in it was great. On a funny note because of the main characters looks, I kinda felt like I was watching a love story about Rick Astley and Dan Aykroyd."
2,predictable but OK,"Slightly too immature in the actions of the main characters being in their early thirties; but typical drama seen in much of the lesbian culture. Fast, predictable read but enjoyable."
1,Very weak performance for a B&D product...,"I was highly disappointed with this product because it is extremely weak. The ""blow"" factor was equivalent to that of your hair dryer on the lowest setting. I returned the item."
1,Flimsy flap,"Nice color, has 20 file spaces, and the file part seems very sturdy, but the flap that closes over the top is inexplicably and ridiculously thin, about as thick as a manilla file folder. What makes this especially bad is that the velcro closure holds like iron, and you have to tug quite hard on the flimsy flap to yank it free. So, the very first time I opened it, the flap got all bent. I cannot imagine the flap will last long, so I decided to toss this in the garbage (within 5 minutes of receiving it). I got an old-fashioned brown one made by Smead (also purchased on Amazon), that has the old-fashioned elastic cord closure and a much sturdier flap."
2,My favorite Female Artist,"This is one of my top ten greatest Cd'S of all time.I love this young Woman's voice .It is so crisp and clear.There are a lot of other singers that have been more succesfull,but are not half as talented as Wendy.I had the opportunity to meet Ms Moten on a few occasions,each time she was exceptionally nice and easy to talk to.I only hope she has new music out soon.I really would like to hear something new from her. ''Come on in out of the Rain '' Girl!!!"
1,Not a Fan,"I have been playing the Tony Hawk games since the first one on Playstation. I however, stopped keeping up after THUG came out. Recently I purchased a PS3, and wanted a newer THPS game. I ended up choosing Project 8, because of the price and people didn't seem to like Proving Ground. I was horribly disappointed with this game. First of all, you can't disable auto-kick, which is a huge let down for anyone who actually skates. Also, the semi-realistic scaling achieved in THUG, has seem to disappear completely. Second, they removed some of the most iconic skaters from the game, THPS without Reynolds, gimme a break. Third, the game is rated T for teen, but game play seems to have been created with children in mind. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone who skates, or is over the age of 12."
1,Fabulous until 3rd wash,"These were SO wonderful at first....soft & thick, very cozy ~ but after the 3rd washing, pill balls EVERYWHERE! Our sheets felt like fine-grained sandpaper! We have a HE washer that doesn't twist the sheets (which supposedly causes pillballs) but we ended up having them anyways. If I can find the packing label I'm sending them back for a refund. Pity, it was such a great deal. :o("
2,Why such a low rating?,This movie is more than enjoyable and I am glad I didn't pay attention to the low rating. The movie is not just a little funny but extremely funny. My favorite part: the recording of the message on the answering machine. :D But just watch it and enjoy! WORTH every minute.
2,The best,"I have owned many metal cutting saw blades over the years, but this is the best. Best price and best performance. Cutting aluminum (we do that a lot) is like cutting through butter with a hot knife; so smooth and even quiet, it will surprise you. Highly recommend."
1,Title is misleading...,"As someone with severe osteoarthritis (and a fused foot at 18), I find this book very annoying not because glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate were and are not an option for me, but simply because it is basically junk food for the masses. I have friends who have had success with glucosamine and chondroitin, and others who have not. I hate to say it, but most people with arthritis (and especially osteoarthritis) are not willing to do what it takes to manage the disease--using common sense (which does not seem to be so common)by eating a healthy diet, losing excess weight, and exercise. Be open and honest with your doctor and family about your disease! If something isn't working, make it known! Most importantly, good self-esteem, perseverance, and a desire to succeed will do more for most people than any supplement, NSAID, hyaluronic acid injection, etc. Overall, I think one will accomplish more by using common sense and communication than reading this book."
1,Eh...,"This is not a good film by any stretch, although I'll admit the stupid comedy amused me at times. But like Cheaper By the Dozen before it, this is pointless, uninspired remake of a classic movie.Dennis Quaid has a reputation of being a good actor who often picks the worst films to appear in and lo and behold, he does it again here. Rene Russo and a few other notable actors get to taint their resumes as well.If there is one thing I really like its Danielle Panabaker. She's just plain cute! I would'nt mind seeing her appear in something good again.Darkhorse86"
1,classic...or something,"This film spawned the Jason icon. But, other than that, it's watered-down a bit for my taste. I saw this unedited for the first time not too long ago, and I was excited about experiencing the epic ""Jason mask"" for the first time! However, Jason doesn't emerge in the mask until,like, the third one. The main culprit in this first one is Jason's mother. Strange...and not as classic as the Jason Vorhees we all know and love. I suppose, by 80's horror film schlock standard, this film is mediocre. And, it has its place. But the down side is, it's not a Jason movie at all, so don't expect to see him."
2,"Incredible, delusional adaptation!","This movies is by far my favorite of all the Alice movies that I own! This adaptation is incredibly unique and completely fascinating to watch! Obvious that much time and care was put into the making of this film. I would not, however, recommend this film for children since when I watched it with a 22-year-old friend, she found it disturbing and asked me to turn it off. One of the films main characters is the product of taxadermy, and there is very little speaking and virtual silence for much of the movie except for the sound of scurrying and footsteps and such. Personally, I found it brilliant and completely engrossing!"
1,Home Security,"Written in the UK, only partly applicable to the US market.Wireless technology is not covered. Which is a big disadvantage since wireless has become the preferred alternative to hardwird systems. The lock technology presented seems to be quaint."
2,"Very quiet, great heater","I bought one for my daughter's bedroom after having one at my office last winter. I tried my husband's heater that he said was quiet...not! My definition of quiet is that you can't hear the motor at all, just a rush of air but only when you get within a few feet of it. The high setting is what I use at work since I have an open office but the low setting in a closed 12X13 bedroom is a bit too warm so we use the thermostat there."
1,Very disappointing,"We make a lot of waffles in our house, so when our old 4 waffle maker was on its last legs, I saw the 6 waffle iron and thought it was perfect. Unfortunately the size of the unit was barely larger than my old 4 waffle unit. The actual waffle size is so much smaller than a regular waffle both in width/length and in height, there really is no gain. IMO there is no reason to pay the extra money for 6 waffles when you really aren't getting anything more. I never used it and am sending it back, so I can't speak for how well it actually makes waffles, but if you're looking to be able to make more waffles than a 4 unit iron, don't bother."
1,Don't believe the reviews!,"Sadly, there is a real trend in this country for reviewers to fall for a PR's hype and laud a book that just isn't anywhere near as good as the author and the publisher would like us to believe. The Tulip is a prime example of this phenomenon. I must have read four or five reviews of the book before I bought it, and they were all gushing in their praise for The Tulip and for Anna Pavord. Sadly, neither is remotely worth it. This volume is over-written, over-priced and over-long. Do yourself a favour. Don't fall for the hype and don't waste your money on the Tulip."
2,Love that off the grid can opener,"I've been looking for a ""swing away"" can opener for almost 15 years. Handier than the hand model, you can't lose it. It's easy to clean, and opens cans easily. I would still use a hand model for huge cans."
2,Don't Leave Home Without It,"Great assortment of fuses. This is the best-priced and most extensive set of fuses I've been able to find. They are packaged fantastically. Convenient little partitions inside a plastic box, as shown in the picture. There is almost every amperage of fuse you could need, from 3-30 amps. There's a fuse-puller as well. I've used these on my 2004 Volvo S-60 R, but they should be compatible with any car that uses Regular or ATO fuses, as described here:[...]I checked it out before buying to make sure.Happy Shopping!"
1,NO ACLARARON QUE EL SELLO ES WS LATINO,"Estos señores que adquirieron los derechos de esa prestigiosa casa disquera, hacen los CD usando CDR, algo que no aclaran los vendedores. Esa clase de productos más parecen discos piratas que discos originales, y lo que es peor, lo cobran como si fuera un producto de primera calidad. Les advierto a los compradores que este sello (WS Latino), Jesika, Seeco, Disco Hit y otros que se me escapan, tienen la misma práctica de vender estos horribles discos. Yo puedo hacer una copia mejor en mi computador, hacerle un label en una impresora Epson y quedan mejor presentados que esos espantosos discos de esas empresas que menciono, y todo a un costo de menos de 2 dólares. Ojo, coleccionistas: estos señores meten ""gato por liebre""."
1,Disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed by this work and even stopped reading it after the section on Nietzsche, which is the third 'writer' discussed in the book. While the overview and topic of the book seemed like a good idea I found it significantly lacking. The writer is strongly biased towards one interpretation and the section on Nietzsche's writings contained many egregious errors. Most of the conclusions in the book were almost forced and author's opinion usually stood without any objective merit. I believe there are better books on these fine, talented individuals that you can spend your money on. Please keep in mind that this book was originally writen in the 1950's and this plays into the author's views, being focused highly on WWII and Religion. While I did gain a minute amount of insight into the author's views on these writers it is not enough for me to give it 2 stars."
2,"Well-thought, well-written and now, well-read!",I stumbled onto this book by accident while browsing at an airport. What a fantastic find! I am impressed with the ease that this books reads at and with the superb character job done by the writers. Tackling something as complex as the Rapture is a difficult challenge and I feel the writers have done so eloquently. They have done so in a way which is entirely believable. I have never been much of a reader of Christian material and I look forward enthusiastically to reading the other novels in this series.
2,"Enya's musical shines through, as usual","I am a fussy, discriminating, not-easy-to please musician who has played professional jazz trumpet for years. But Enya's music never fails to bring me a sense of euphoria that I don't find even with my favorite jazz or other tracks on a consistent basis. Her music is without a doubt, a gift of the spirit, and her kindred soul always permeates her music. What's truly unique here is that the music of Enya---while so pleasing and universal to an obviously wide audience---somehow escapes commercialism or banality. I suppose when a soul truly and earnestly speaks, it does so without having to rely on gimmickry or superficiality, nor on the primal scream of the banging drum. It speaks deeply, quietly and beautifully to anyone who will listen. Listen to this music."
2,Disturbing and unfortunately real!,"More than happy with the content of this documentary. It confirms that absolute mess this world is in due to greedy self indulgent politicians and war mongers, and that includes all nations that have nuclear arms and those trying to acquire them. There is no justification for storing 100's or 1000's or nuclear war heads on the pretense of deterrence.Russia unfortunately is indicative of a what happens when a countries political and economic system fails, it placed more emphasis on containing food storage facilities than nuclear war heads or waste, absolutely crazy.Worth watching for those who want to know the facts about the state of the worlds nuclear (arms) industry."
1,Shuts off after 5 minutes and won't come back on for 1+ hour,"I don't shave very often and I bought these clippers to trim my beard before shaving. I can only get 50% of my face before the clippers stop working. I'm not sure if they're overheating or what. I've tried oiling the heck out of them, but nothing seems to matter. Very frustrating."
2,Second one is great,The first one that we received was defective. Actually parts in the area where you can change from edging to trenching slipped gears fell off!Sent it back and received another one that is great. Love the fact that you can choose the depth of the edging.
2,IS THE DVD COMPLETE AND UNABRIDGED?,I've read a lot of confusing reviews about Lonesome Dove on DVD. It's my favourite book and I've got a pretty well used copy of the mini series I video-taped when it aired on TV. I want to purchase the DVD but before doing so would like feedback on whether the DVD (containing 2 discs) is a true transfer from the original VHS version. Could someone categorically verify this for me. Thanks.
1,Not very practical,"I keep going back to this book with the idea of brewing a batch of pop and get increasingly frustrated with the complexity of the recipes. Similar to a gourmet cook book....ounces of this...inches of that...vanilla bean, cinnamon bark, sassafras root...yeah, let me go pick a bean and strip some bark. Pretty muck worthless....a real buzz kill. As someone else mentioned, sasafrass root is no longer available. I'm still looking for a better book with realistic and practical recipes. Until then it is better to surf the net for recipes."
1,Wrong Title Also,"I ordered this in March. Got the wrong title twice! Got a refund. No one at Amazon is monitoring this, even though I explicitly asked them to do so."
2,Adorable and durable,Minnetonka moccasins make excellent baby shoes. The quality is consistently high. Easy to slip on but stay on nicely. Fringes are interesting for babies. Soles are nice and soft for creeper to toddler transitions.
1,Great Music Destroyed by Annoying Vocals,"It's amazing how few people are disturbed by this wheezemeister's annoying noise that distracts the listener from the music. What a frustrating experience it is for me - just as you are starting to enjoy a great solo, as you watch its progression, that dreadful wheezing starts and knocks the bottom out of it. Arrggg!"
2,"Review of movie, ""Freddie Got Fingered""",This is one of the funniest movies I have seen and is a favorite in my collection. I have seen it a few times on cable and had to have my own copy to enjoy over and over again.
1,fell apart...,fell apart maybe the second time I wore it. does not keep its shape. very cheap material/fabric. i would not recommend this
2,Great Trailer,"Recently got this bike trailer, easy assembly. It works great. My 8 month old and 3 year old girls fit in together with no problem. There is not a lot of support, so when my 8 month old rides alone, I prop a boppy pillow around her and a pillow under her feet to keep her upright. She immediatley falls asleep whenever she rides in it. Works great as a stroller too! Very easy to maneuver and folds compactly. Kind of hard for the little ones to wear helmets as the back of the helmet hits the material in back making it uncomfortable. Great for casual bikers. Would highly recommend it for the price."
2,What a great book!,"A nice view of the human side of the Los Alamos Project: It was more than just building a bomb, you know."
1,Worst shipping company ever was used,"Amazon keeps telling me my package was delivered, but I've been on the phone with the delivery service ""Lasership"" for two days. I ordered one day delivery on Monday and it's now Friday. I'm sitting here with a bleached head waiting to use my dye but woops, it's still not here!If I had realized that ordering one day service off of an amazon prime seller meant wasting my time waiting around for some piece of crap delivery service (instead of the USPS or UPS, why?) I never would have ordered from here.Here's hoping I finally get my hair dye before I have to go to work all weekend looking like a complete idiot."
1,"Great songs, but poor recorded quality","I should read the 1 star reviews first, all of them point out the lousy recording quality. It is horrible distortion if you play it at the pure stereo."
1,the last legion,I wasn't very impressed with this movie. It is very clean as with language. There is violence of course but even that isn't too bad. The story was okay but not that thrilling. THe acting wasn't that great either.
2,nice set,i reviewed the green set i bought just like this. that is the reason i bought this one. i liked it so i bought another. I just wish there was a larger one to go with these.
2,Works GREAT!!!,This epilator is a dream come true. Now I don't have to spend all that money on waxing. It is better and the results lasts longer than shaving. I highly recommend it. Of course it misses an occasional very short hair or two but they are not obvious and can be caught if you hover over that spot.
1,This book is a waste of money,"I purchased this book a few years ago and got ""sucked into"" purchasing a blueprint. The ""plans"" are sketches of mature yards, and the ""plan view"" doesn't really help as far as knowing what plants to use. What ends up happening is you spend more money on the blueprints. THEN when you get the blueprints, the plants ""recommended"" for your region aren't easy to obtain!Blueprints in hand, I visited a local nursery and struck out with many of the plants recommended.Don't waste your money, hoping that for $11 you'll get a useful landscape plan."
2,A different twist.,"Right off, I liked it - a lot. This genre of film is right up my alley. A good story line. Excellent acting by Mr. Cage (and I'm not a fan). Supporting cast adequate. Fast moving - action - kept my interest throughout. The story moves easily from start to finish. The theme: time, and ones ability to see ahead - not really unique, however, with a ""different twist"", which I thoroughly enjoyed. Both Ms. Moore and Ms. Biel had important roles, however, were shadowed by Mr. Cage who was really in his element."
1,One two listenable songs.,"Nothing is like Liz's earlier efforts. Tracks one and seven are OKAY - but that's it. ""Exile in Guyville"" and ""Whip-Smart"" blow this out of the water. Liz fans from previous albums should avoid this one. It's pretty close to terrible.rating: D"
2,Jessica,"It's really good, I wish it came in blue-ray though. Made me fall in love with Jessica Alba again a"
2,Simple step-by-step guide,"This is a simple English step-by-step guide to new recording studio owners. Although the steps are trivial, however they are the basic building blocks to your success in this industry. I found it oversimplified, more information could be added without complexing it. No enough images included. For $11, it worths to be bought.I would give it 3.5 stars. But because there is no half star in the rating system, 4 stars is my rating."
2,A-okay pack!,Great price and good quality. They did fit a little snug on my adult head but they can easily be stretched out. The side arms of the glasses are also very flat and look a little different than the typical version of neon party glasses.
2,SCARY AS HELLZ,"If you are looking to be scared to death, by all means pick this DVD up. Those who tell you not to watch this at night alone are not kidding, it's one of the most disurbing movies I have ever seen. First of all the cut up sacks on the heads of the Strangers is spookeeyyyy, really the site of them give you like a viseral scare. The movie has holes yes, I mean it's a horror film, they all do, I mean, right?..but really this movie is one that will give you nightmares, sort of like watching, the little girl crawl out of the TV in, The Ring, or the zombies in 28 weeks later, it's the way it's filmed and edited that makes this a real fright. Highly Recomended if you're into this sort of thing, personally, after seeing this, im good on horror films for a while."
1,Not what I expected.,"I just read this book after reading another Welfonder ""Knight"" book and even though I gave this book a shot thinking the other book was maybe not her best(new author to me). These books do too much talking of lore,demons,dragons and atmosphere and not nearly enough about the main characters. I would read another Welfonder book, but there would be nothing else available and I'd be prepared to turn past the overdone descriptions. Read with caution."
1,Poor purchase,Cheap. Switch does not work and the light is so dim it serves no purpose. Furthermore it is very fragile plus magnet is not strong enough to hold it's own weight. Do not waste your money on this junk.
1,NeatReceipts,"The product did not live up to my expectations after a strong plug by a QuickBooks Proadvisor. I found the folder storage awkward and inadequate. The scanner did not read the amounts accurately. It didn't ""learn"" by reading the same type of receipt multiple times. There was too much data entry to do after the receipt was scanned which completely defeated the entire purpose for me purchasing the machine: cut down data entry time of receipts into QuickBooks.The product was very easy to link to QuickBooks and export but it exported the entries as general journals which is not an acceptable quality of bookkeeping for me.There are precious few user instructions, as well.My conclusion is that it is completely inadequate from a professional standpoint. It might have some value to an individual who wants to replace their paper receipts with electronic copies. But that's about it."
2,Bangup job,"Read this book, bang up job, good easy reading, not too predictable but interesting. Worth your time and gives insight to that era of the US history in battle.Kudos to Mr. Graley...G2"
2,Even better than season 1,"Season two of Bones allows us to delve further into that unlikely attraction between ""cocky"" FBI Agent Booth and his tough-as-nails partner Dr. Brennan, which was only hinted at in the first season. We also get a glimpse into the past when the finale introduces us to Brennan's father, who may not be who he seems... Emily Deschanel is phenomenal as the socially-challenged (and often hilarious) Dr. Brennan, and she and David Boreanaz have amazing chemistry. It's wonderful to see their relationship unfold little by little, with each case they tackle. Can't wait for next season!"
2,Excellent,I found this book very helpful. It's easy reading and the home work assignments are clear and easy to follow. It was helpful to have the examples of other people's experiences. Kari's book will be one that I will share with others knowing that it touched my heart and helped me heal.
1,How to Eat Fried Worms - not very good quality!,"I bought this book for my classroom. The VERY first time a child read it, the pictures in the middle started tearing out. Very disappointing!"
2,Helped my pain,"This definitely help protect my thumb, but fortunately I decided that I needed more and had corrective surgery performed, and now no pain."
1,All expert puzzles,"My book had all expert puzzles although it had labels for beginner to expert. I don't know if I got a different edition but I have done Sudoku puzzles online which are far easier than the so called beginner ones in this book. The first ones are the same difficulty as the final ones. When you average 27 given numbers in the beginner section and also the expert section, you know someone made a mistake when they printed the book or did their program to create the puzzles. If you are already an expert, this is good for working the puzzles. If you are a beginner, you will likely get very discouraged. You can use the helps in the beginning and create some of your own to be able to work the puzzles."
1,Keep Looking...,"If you are looking for a good beginners Spanish language text, keep looking. This book presents under the umbrella of Barron's which is a solid name. This one, however, lacks the two ""C""'s: cohesion and clarity.The package comes with a study guide, a companion book and four CD's. Unfortunately, when you put the study guide and companion book together, you get nothing but confusion. You need to keep switching between books, exercises do not seem to match and on the CD you are not given enough time to respond to the words or phrases.The book does have some positives. It is attractively packaged and the study guide is colorfully illustrated.As an alternative, may I suggest the first text I completed. Frank Zambrano's ""The Everything Learning Spanish Book"" was very helpful. I paired this with a basic audio program and loved it. And it had the two ""C""'s: cohesion and clarity."
2,Great movie!,"The X-Files was a great show and I loved the idea that the movie was just the continuation of the story. It was a giant episode and I ate up every moment of it. There were great reveals, wonderful character moments and every second was exciting. But don't watch this as a stand alone. This needs to be seen within the show."
2,panda humidifer,I love my panda humidifier. it is so adorable and so quiet. i got a penguin one at target for my birthday present but i had to return it because the mist wasn't working. i ordered the panda one and it's working great so far. humidifier helps me to sleep and helps with the cough during sleep. i had drop shape one last year and it didn't last long. so i got a new one.
2,Kindle review,"I have wanted this product since first reading about it. When the price went down a smidge, I decided to order it. I LOVE it.It is easy to use and I love the instant downloading of books.I plan to take it on vacation next week. SOOOO much easier than toting LOTS of books on a flight."
2,amazing colorist,"For 10 bucks you will find no better example of fine colorist work. Dimagmaliw has an amazing ability to find colors that convey tone and establish setting. He then works them into complementary collages that dazzle the eye. Even if you already know the story, you will likely find this volume well worth it."
2,A little of everything...,"I got this CD like two weeks ago, Trustkill sent it out before the release date if you pre-order it. This CD has not left my player. It's like if Queens of the Stone Age, Smashing Pumpkins, Jane's Addiction and Failure having an orgy in the desert. I haven't heard of any of their music before this CD. If the first CD is anything like this...I'll be rockin' that one too."
1,URGH!!!!!,B.F. Skinner is the greatest scientist of our time. The author doesn't like his conclusions so rejects him. Just like when people couldn't accept the earth revolved the sun people always villify what they don't understand. This is more than pathetic. the author is an embarrassment to science. Please buy books by B.F. Skinner. He is not afraid to reveal the truth through true science.
1,Not a Clancy Book,"I am a big Tom Clancy fan. I have read all his books and have enjoyed everyone of them until now. The first 800 pages ramble and the final 200 are plain silly. It was a big disappointment after such books as The Sum of All Fears and Rainbow Six. Come on Tom, if you are not ready to write a good book then don't write anything. We are spoiled."
1,Hard to believe,"I gave the author the benefit of the doubt for most of the book, but when he claimed to have seen bigfoot, it makes the rest of the story hard to believe. Seems more like a charlatan to me."
2,Finally a good Bond!,"This is the 1st 5 star Bond since Goldfinger. They should have kept George Lazenby for a couple more movies in my opinion. The special effects are great (finally). This had one of the most strongest plots of any Bond (with him getting married and all). The was sort of sad (I don't cry when I watch movies, like u needed to know that) when his wife (of about 20 minutes) got killed by Blofeld's gunman."
2,This is great!,"Just got my cd today, this is awesome. A must have cd! Can't wait until they put out an full length.Jimmy Planutis"
2,Another gread DVD,This of course was such a good dvd and another great piece of work for Michael Jackson. I really will miss his work.
1,Crap on a Stick,"This book skips steps especially in the beginning. Homework answers are often just a fact. Lacks a precise algorithm in helping students learn. Wish the teacher in this class is good, cause this book is wack. BEWARE!"
1,Programmers: Don't waste your money,"If you are a programmer that doesn't know Director and wants to pick up Lingo, this isn't the book for you. The author doesn't use conventional terminology to refer to scalars, arrays, control structures, etc. The index is crap too. You can't use it to look up anything an ordinary programming reference would have. The only control structure in the index is IF/ELSE !Learning Lingo is outdated (covering only Director 4), and severely lacking in content and structure. I'm sorry I shelled out... for this one."
1,HORRIBLE FLAG POLE BRACKET,"I had my flag up no more than 30 mins, in winds of 10-15 mph and the base of this bracket cracked and fell on my car. I would NOT buy this bracket!"
1,Time could have been better spent,"A flimsy, repetitive and disjointed book that manages to mildly entertain at first, before the ennui sets in. It's a series of vignettes rather than a narrative, and whilst I don't think Marion herself would have made any grand claims for it, the editors (whose presence is constantly felt) seem to be trying to elevate Marion Davies to a level of literary and historical importance that just isn't justified."
2,Wonderful anime series,"What can I say this anime is one fun ride. Full Metal Panic is one show that has everything you want: action, drama, love, comedy all wrapped into one anime. I am not sure how they do it but they do it so well.I love the two main characters Kanami and Sousuke. They are strong characters that you can't help but love them in action.Story is well done. Beautiful animation. Some funny stories. Some action pack stories.I hope there is a fourth season for this show."
1,This machine doesn't such up water,"NEGATIVE:This machine does not such up water therefore leaving the carpet much wet.Bad enginnering: Whoever thought of designed a plastic bladder to contain clean water and at the same time place it in the dirty water container, what if the bladder leak, you'll have clean water mixing with dirty water.Small tank therefore one need to empty the tank and change water more often.The double brushes do not clean well.POSITIVE:NoneOverall this machine is going back to the store where it comes from"
1,These Guys Wouldn't Know The Truth If It Bit Them,"Talk about your media bias. The plain truth is that all the military records show these guys are liars, funded by a close friend of Karl Rove, George Bush's hachet man. Even if you don't believe the military records, these very SAME men are on the record praising Kerry as heroic and saying all the same things the military said about him, some as recently as this year. This book is trash, and reading it made my hands feel slimey."
2,Great product at a great price.,"This product works very well. My husband uses it all the time in his car. The sound is very clear, CD quality. Very easy to setup. Very good price."
2,It works,Better than blowing hot breath or spit on your lens. More powerful than I can spit air out. It's bigger than I was expecting (bulb takes up my entire palm). The red tip comes out and you can invert it for storage. It does what it's supposed to and it does it well. Worth getting if you want to care for your camera.
2,really cheap,"when I first put them on I had elephant knees, i had to pull them up the whole night. next tome i buy some white tight at a department store."
1,Only enjoyable if you don't take it seriously,"Everything from the pacing to the characterization is too outlandish to take seriously and any attempts to read it as a serious work of fiction led to a headache within a minute. In truth, it read more like a farce (and that is often times a stretch) and can only be enjoyed in the same fashion as the movies mocked in the mystery science theater 3000 could be."
1,A first draft of a manuscript,The poor presentation of the material leaves in doubt the veracity of the subject matter and the writing ability of the author. The one star rating is generous.
1,NOT A Region 1 DVD !,The item here is listed as a region 1 DVD (USA and Canada). This is NOT true.This is a PAL DVD ! I just got mine and it will not play in my player.Thanks for screwing me over Amazon!
1,Can't Believe the Number of Typos/Errors!,"I picked this book up at the book store without the benefit of these reviews--my mistake! There are too many typos/errors in the book. I'm taking the LSAT in December, so I've discarded this one for Powerscore's Logic Games Bible. I wouldn't recommend this one."
2,this cd is very funky and fresh,"The Artist and the NPG really no how to lay down in your face fresh funk. The snyth grooves and tight horn sections along with real instruments and layered vocals make this a nice party cd. Old school funk fans will hear a lot of Parlament-Funkadelic, EWF, and Prince in this cd. It may be too funky for non funk believers, because the grooves never stop. This really sounds like ""free"" music. The NPG band as always, is very tight delivering this funk."
1,Horribly Right-Sided Evaluation of President Obama,"At first, this seems as if it might be a well thought out, informative film; however, it is not. Granted, some of the history in the film is true (for instance, Obama's childhood family situation), but the main point of the film is all wrong. The author that spawned this ridiculous documentary assumes a theory of President Obama's motives that simply does not make sense. Though the film will try to convince you that this theory is correct, please think critically. This is an extremely inaccurate, slanderous, pro-conservative film - do not mistake it for an unbiased, objective documentary."
1,Don't buy these.,These sound terrible. I bought the same model number a few years ago and love them. Needed a second pair. What happened to this product?
2,"""Stoner and Spaz""","I have CP like the main boy in the book (though nowhere near as severe, you can hardly tell I have it) and I thought it was an excellent portrayal of the everyday challenges people with CP and other movement disabilities face when trying to fit in with ""normal"" people""Stoner and Spaz"" is about a romance between 2 oddities, Ben Bancroft, a boy with spastic CP and Colleen Minou, a young druggie. Ben is very insecure within himself and mostly just mooches around at the movies rather than face the jeers and taunts of his fellow peers. It is not until Colleen comes into his life that he attempts to go about the usual social activities of a 16 yr old boy. With Colleen he smokes, drinks, goes to dances and has sex. This book is an excellent read which makes the reader cry, laugh and gasp all at once. I highly recommend it."
2,Pierce Brosnan IS James Bond,"After two average Bond movies Pierce Brosnan is now firmly in James Bond's shoes and making must-see films out of the 007 franchise that looked like it was on it's last legs only a decade earlier. The plot is about an evil business man who intends on launching the first truely international TV news station, but he wants a hot story and top coverage. To acheive this he decides to start a war between China and Britain and capture the events of film before anyone else, mega ratings and mega money. A sound plot that dips in the middle due to the tedious love storyline that dominates most of the screen time, until Bond's love interest is killed off - thew! Back to the action and an explosive ending - just the way we like it!"
1,like wasting my time for nothing,"This book was recommended to me by so many people--and intelligent people at that!--but I was highly disappointed. Not only is it not written well, but the ending is anti-climactic. The dialogue is written poorly, with no real personality to it; characters' motives often go unexplained; the fantastical/magical elements of the story appear sporadically, as do the main character's special powers in the kitchen; additionally, the extensive description of the recipes bog down the plot movement. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Stopped the Itch,I purchased this shamppoo because my Mastiff was having severe itching. It has somewhat controlled it. But it is to soon to tell. But I recommened it to everyone.
1,"Ridiculous, Designed quite possibly by Fisher-Price","First off, I'll talk about the size of the band. The armband is resizable by velcro and at it's smallest, it's too tight for my arm. I'm a runner not a bodybuilder, so go figure who on who decided the proper size for this thing should be. Next, a key feature of the Nike+ is......well, let's see, how about the fact that it can display all of your running data as you run? It shows MPH, laps, etc.... What good is it to display ALL of this data on the IPod Nano screen as you run....if the Nike+ case covers the screen completely. There are hundreds of Ipod armband cases on the market and this is the first one I have ever seen that covers the screen.So, to recap. It's way too small. And, while the purpose of the Nike+ is to display running stats.....the Nike+ armband covers the screen. Way to go Nike."
1,"Efficient air conditioner, but some annoying flaws.","This model is very good at churning out cool air to chill a large room. No complaints there. But the biggest drawback is that it's noisy, even at the lowest fan setting. I sometimes have to turn it off in order to hear a phone call. I have other air condiditioners in the house more than 20 years old that are much quieter. Why they can't make a quiet air conditioner today is beyond me. Another irritating feature is the piercing beep emitted every time you use the remote control. I don't need an annoying confirmation that I just did what I did. I don't see any way to turn this gremlin sound off. Some good features are the different cooling modes, including energy saver, auto cool, and sleep mode. But the constant noise makes me wish I had found something quieter, even at the expense of cooling power."
1,It seemed to be a mens baseball jersey........,"But turned out to be a ladies top....... i gave it to my missus, but she never wore it not really being a fan of the band"
2,Sunday morning CD,"This Bill Evans CD is a classic. If you don't have this, please order a copy today. Steven"
1,Not very funny - Not very good,I've enjoyed previous films by the actors/director but this was awful. Not very funny at all and extremely hard to believe. Paul Rudd and Kristen Wiig were the only two bright spots in this awful film. My husband and I talked about turning it off serveral times but kept giving it a chance to get better. The only good parts: Kristen Wiig's limited appearances and Paul Rudd in the vegas hotel room. But that didn't make it worth watching. Skip this one.
2,worked fine,20 more words required. O.k. well its just a damned connector it won't time travel or nothing..Can't fix global warming or an arrogant idiot in the whitehouse. I plugged it into my motherboard plugged in a 32 gig thumbdrive and now I have a place to hide my porn from the little woman....
1,salton warranty problematic at best,"After owning a breadman for several years, and worked fairly well, it has broken down. Most good companies I expect to have a good warranty, no questions asked, etc. However, the warranty is only one year. Basically, this says to me that this unit is only good in the short-term and then has problems. If you are confident in your work, then back it up with a good warranty. I was told I could return mine and get a refurbished one with only a 90day warranty for 40 dollars. NO thanks, Mr. Breadman"
1,Loved It At First But Now Don't Use It,"12/30/11 - We bought this product in 2010 and loved it at first but eventually we stopped using it because we started having problems with mold around the top edges of the marble, even though we kept the water changed. We threw the contaminated butter away, washed the crock with soap and water and tried again, but we continued to have mold problems. We got tired of throwing expensive butter away and having to wash the crock out, but after awhile it just wasn't worth it, anymore, so we stopped using it."
1,Bad,I lived in Hawaii when I ordered this and the spray molded over. I only used it once or twice on my son for his diaper rash. Get the ointment holds up way better!
2,Good but a word of caution,"I bought this cd because i like angst in my pants so much since i was a kid so i wanted another cd by Sparks i heard this one is the there best so i bought it. I cant really understand what the singer is saying he is very high pitchey sounds like Tiny Tim so the good sparks lyrics that are on this cd get lost in his funny voice luckly this cd comes with the lyrics. The good thing about this cd though is the music the guitars, bass and drums are quite good."
1,Why does amazon persist in supplying offnesive racist islamophobic movies to view????????????/,I am bewildered at the policy that allows such offensively racist and islamophobic films to be made available here.
1,DO NOT GET THIS STRAIGHTENER,Do not get this product. It worked really great for awhile and then it just stopped working the red light would not stay on! I thought at first that I did something to make it break you know overusing it or something but now I read the reviews and realize I was not the only one whose straightener broke! Do not get this prouduct!
1,Only good for 2 weeks,"The pump is not very good, I actally got better results by using the pump that comes with Coleman's air matresses. I's good as a temporary solution but not longer that 2 weeks of continous use. The seams on the upper section start to open and air leaks out rapidly"
1,"Good, but Incubus can do (and has done) WAAAAY better","I've never understood why a group capable of great things, is willing to be satisifed by utter mediocrity. Make Yourself is a great album for some group...but not for Incubus. For Incubus, it's a weak offering, not nearly coming close to what we know they're capable of. The songs are slow, and lacking the frantic energy of SCIENCE. I've heard it called ""mature"". Frankly, I'm offended that mature apparently equals slow and repetitive. Do yourself a favor. ""Make Yourself"" buy SCIENCE. You'll thank me."
2,This is the best series ever.,"Mr. Peel if you are reading this then I urge you to keep writing. I know so many kids like this series me included. The only problem I had with book number 6 is I don't think it had enough magic that was used by Score, Healine, and Pixle otherwise it was great and anyone who has no read one of these books needs to get a life."
1,Not at all impresed,"The batteries on the SKIL Xdrive series are a pain in the rearend to get off! I am a woman and I use powertools often in the house, the drill most often but I use the saw as well and I have to wait for my husband to get home from work to get the battery off. And he has problems with it too.I want a powertool that is easy to use and that includes changing the battery. I do like the overall feel of the drill as well as the light that is on teh drill that helps when working in darker places."
1,The Worst Ever!!!!!,"This is by far the worst cd I own. I have every dire straits/knopfler cd there are. It is by one band called the Sultans of Swain (the same band the song was written about 25 years ago). It is no mystery why we have never heard of them since. The singer is a cross between Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, and Porky Pig. No emotion in any of the singing or guitar parts. The guitarist seems to be reading the music with no feeling at all. He may not have ever heard the original songs. I would have thought I was on Candid Camera if I was not in my house the first time I listened to it. It is pathetic. The only reason they got signed, is because Mark wrote such a great song about the band 25 years ago. Don't waist your time......."
2,a good read,I read this book within 24 hours of getting it and I was mostly pleased. The detail was detailed but it did help in many ways to understand many things I had been reading on the web. The techie stuff on weapons and radios and miltary stuff was tuff for me. The American making people pay for their bad deeds and regaining the constitution was a plus for me....made me think of G Washington's vision. I would recommend this book for those who realize that the world is not a perfect place and America will suffer some loss because we forget what we ran from when this country started.....plus we just have ungrateful people who want power over their neighbors.
2,Los Enanitos Verdes....what more can you ask for?!,"Los Enanitos Verdes has to be one of my favorite spanish rock bands. This cd is awesome. I mean you have the muralla verde, tus viejas cartas, and dame otra oportunidad all on one cd!!!! All of the other songs are great too. I highly recommend this cd for any enano fan or anyone who wants to listen to good music."
2,Aliens?,"Worth seeing but not alien good. Great special effects and some white knuckle moments, could have been better. Enjoyable, glad I didn't shell out the money at the theater."
2,"Great story, with lots of twists & turns",First major role for Daniel Craig and a great start to his career. Good mysterious who-done-it with lots of great characters and interesting plot.
1,Am I missing something?,"Sorry, but I found this book to be rather boring and repetitive. I did not like the character Holden, and thought he should grow up."
2,Stunning guitar trio jazz exploration,"If you like your jazz to be cutting edge then search no more. Guitar wizard DAVID TORN & friends take a wild ride in the world of looping improvisation, taking us back,(or forwards), to the days of vintage Jan Garbarek or Terje Rypdal.Miles Davis surely has to be listening from beyond the grave to the trio FOREVER.SHARP & VIVID. Guitar exploration as only DAVID TORN can, with the support of bass clarinet and Tony Williams style drumming. Easily brings up memories of those early Eric Dolphy Blue Note dates.Traveling from free-form to sonic filmscapes full of Dali-esque acid-dreams, this CD is a stunner."
2,Great bargain,"The batteries are made in Indonesia, not pictured as in Japan. I don't know if the quality is the same. So far it's still working. Great price though."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"WE BROUGHT THIS TOY HOME AND USED IT ONE TIME (MAYBE 30 MINUTES) BEFORE THE BULB BLEW OUT. ALSO, WHEN YOU SHINE THE PICTURES ON THE WALL (WHICH IS WHAT WE WANTED TO DO) THEY ARE UPSIDE DOWN AND THERE IS NO WAY TO ROTATE THE PICTURE. IF IT WORKED, IT WOULD BE ALOT OF FUN. I GAVE IT A LOW FUN RATING BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF MY THREE SONS EVER HAD A CHANCE TO USE IT! I WOULD EXCHANGE IT BUT IT WAS THE LAST ONE! GOOD LUCK!!"
2,Every Dog and non dog owner should own,"Great read, could not put it down. The information is invaluable. This is a great book to really get to know your dog. The most important thing that she stressed was having a relationship with your dog. There was a good history of dogs and their natural instincts. I liked how she explained how there are so many different aspects to a fatal dog attack.One thing I thought was interesting is that 1 day old infants to 2 month old infants had a high number of fatal dog attacks.The only thing that could have been better were her data charts. They should have been labeled better. Or she should have used graphs."
2,Good mediation,very good guided meditation of the chakras. Dr Chopra's voice is soothing and well suited meditation In addition there is a CD with a relaxing music. It has definitely added to my meditation practice.
1,"sort of boring, unfortunately","I have tried to sit through this movie at least three times, but I lose interest and always find it boring. Nothing in this movie scares me, I never belive that Jack Nicholson is a Dad, or Shelly is his wife. I like Stanley's other movies quite a bit though.I don't like the newer versions of this movie either, they're boring too. I do like most of King's books and movies though. I guess I must be one of the small few who don't like this story very much."
1,It bored me to sleep,"How many times can a writer use the phrases ""After all"" and ""of course"" in a 500 page book and still win a Pulitzer? Apparently, about 500. The writing in this book is lethally dull, the characters are uninteresting and the plot limps along until the very end when it commits suicide. Puh-leeze."
2,Decent collection,I like this book a lot and wish I had not lost it. I need to find it again. This has pretty much all the greats as others have stated. I don't have much more to add but wanted to throw down my 4 stars.
2,Brent Barrett is the absolute best!!,"Barrett is one of the best leading men in NYC! This CD is what sustained me until my first exposure to this gem, Kiss Me Kate came out on DVD! I should warn the ladies to sit when listening it could be dangerous to your health. Because after having this wonderful CD for six months it still makes my knees at certain points!! I especially enjoy his renditions of Come Back to Me, They Call the Wind Maria, She Wasn't You, Anyone Who Loves and the unknown: Tell me, Tell me!! And after seeing him perform live in Camelot i wish he had included a few of those lovely songs! I can't put in words just how much I love this beautifully sung CD! It goes with me everywhere I go! Now if I could get his Kander and Ebb CD life would be great!"
1,Terrible,"The moves she does feel awkward and like they are bad form. Patricia is the only one who looks like she knows what she's doing, but she wasn't even in sync with the music, which was very distracting! I'll admit I only did the first 15 minutes of the workout, but it was so bad I didn't want to try anymore. If you want real kickboxing, try Kathy Smith. Much better."
1,For 80s kids only,"If you like a trip to the eighties, then this is the album for you. That's all I can say about this album. Her earlier tracks sound much better than her recent output, almost sound monotonic."
2,mis information,"The only information that should be corrected, is that JEAN lived in Temple City and not Arcadia. The house is still there, on Golden West, about a block north of the park and City Hall!"
2,Echobelly's best yet.,"Echobelly have grown yet again. Time has honed their style and let them produce their best album to date. Sonya Aurora Madan's angelic voice sweeps you through her songs, with her dazzling lyrics and captivating ideas, until you are singing at the top of your lungs and even accompanying Glenn Johansson on his flying guitar riffs. This album has everything, from the unbelievably catchy ""Iris Art"", ""Everyone Knows Better"" and ""I'm Not A Saint"", to the soulfull accoustics of ""Bleed"" and ""Falling Flame""; from the frantic ( you better not drive while playing this ) pace of ""Drive Myself Distracted"", ""Holding The Wire"" and the unparalleled ""Mouth Almighty"" to the majesty of the orchestra that accompanies in ""Wired On."" I warn everyone now not to play this album before taking a shower as your voice ( and you will be singing ) could travel for miles through the pipes."
2,Surprised by joy,"The listener from NY gets it half right -- this music is marvelous. Anyone who goes to Zelenka expecting to encounter the generic baroque trio sonata is in for a bracing shock. On the other hand, NY's assessment of the performances is less pleasantly shocking. To describe Holliger et. al. as ""dull as dishwater"" is like complaining that Toscanini's pacing of Beethoven's symphonies is ""inert as molasses."" To take one example, just listen to the two oboes squealing like puppies above a deadpan harpsichord continuo! No mistake about it -- Zelenkas's trio sonatas are both wonderful music and wonderfully performed on this desert island disc."
2,Another Winner!,"Each one of the Jack Reacher books seems to be better than the last. I absolutely love Child's shotgun style, and Reacher is definitely my favourite character in the thriller genre. Child's pared-down writing style makes his books beg to be read quickly. And Reacher is the quintessential tough guy. He's always one step ahead of everyone else, including the bad guys, and he's not afraid of a fight in a good cause. In this book Reacher gets mixed up with some Russian bad guys who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. There's a lot about snipers in the book, and that is incredibly interesting. We also get to meet some wonderful secondary characters. I particularly like the ex-marine Cash in this one. A guy right after Reacher's own heart. They are almost like two sides of a coin. Child excels in describing these ""Buddy-scenarios"". But Reacher never hangs around with any of them afterwards. He's always on his way to his next adventure."
1,This CD is a MAJOR dissapointment,"When I ordered this CD, I expected the usual immaculate playing and production from this band (I have all their other CDs, and I recently saw them at Progfest 2000). Unfortunately, what this CD consists of is terrible compositions (except for maybe 1 or 2 tunes... the opening track is absolute garbage) that sound like they were recorded in mud (or someone's garage). This ranks right up there with Genesis's ABACAB as one of the biggest musical dissapointments of my life."
2,Super Introduction to Biography,"I used this book with much success with classes of English as a Second Language students. They found the very short biographies of people they were familiar with to be challenging but readable. I have to admit when I decided to try the book out in class, I had my doubts, but my students just loved it, and were begging for more!"
2,What a wonderful voice!,It's hard to say anything negative about a DVD when it was a great idea and great story. The man- Mr. Shea- has a beautiful voice and a wonderful tesimony.What didn't work was the video itself- the words did not match the lip movement through the whole thing. I found it very annoying.Like I said hard to say something negative but that was bad!His singing is worth the money though.
2,Wonderful Help,I am legally blind and these needles make my life to much easier.Thanks for a super product. I buy them over and over.
1,Not even close!,"My young boy does not connect with this DVD at all. I have played it repeatedly, but to no avail. Baby Mozart is a much better product. The DVD claims to be country, but I fail to find anything country about it. The arrangements of the songs is nothing new."
1,"For such a light toipic as absinthe, this book is dense and boring.","It's like a PhD candidate's dissertation was written on absinthe. Too dense, boring and rambling for a book on absinthe. There are much better absinthe histories out there that provide the same information with out all the pretension."
1,Doesn't meet expectations,"If you liked the movie, don't buy the soundtrack, because what you liked about the movie isn't on the soundtrack! Listening to the soundtrack left us frustrated and wondering where all the good music was!"
2,Don't overlook the awesome sound quality,I would like to add to all the great reviews of the performances on this disk by mentioning the superb audio quality of this CD. It has been used as a reference recording by many respected audio equipment reviewers over the years. If you want to get a measure of how good your sound system canreally sound or if you are in the market for new equipment this is a great cd to take to the store with you. It will bring out the best or not so good of any system you play it on. enjoy
1,"What next, Eva Longoria and Carrot Top?","Synopsis: An irritating slacker, with no job or money, goes to a club he would never be let into. Once inside, he meets a woman beautiful enough to be an anchor on a Hollywood TV show. This woman, who probably avoids anything stronger than water, gets so drunk that she has sex with this son of Harold Ramis.She gets pregnant, he spews some of the most hurtful, foul things one person can say to another and she responds in kind. Finally, after a series of these unpleasant exchanges, she decides he's kinda cute and, of all her options, he's the guy for her. And of course, there are the usual stereotypes of people, saying things real people never say. Its a side splitter."
1,Not for travel,"With this carrier, you get what you pay for. The latches on ours will not stay locked; you cannot lift it by the handle. That is not a problem for us because we got it as a sleeping compartment for our dog. But it would NOT be usable for traveling."
2,Unvarnished Scoop,"The Sword of the Prophet gives an unvarnished look at Islam by means of its history. We see its foundations, its unifying spirit but also its sects and factions, its periods of expansion and of decay, its theology and the cultures it forms. Trifcovic also shows Islam's disdain for values of the modern West: tolerance, personal freedom, individualism, competition, non-violence, progress, and the like."
2,It is exactly what I needed!,I bought this item using the one-touch shopping and I had it within 4 days. It is exactly what I needed to repair my daughter's car radio antenna. It works great! Radio Shack did not have it in stock in the store and Amazon made it easy to complete the job.
2,Christmas Never Sounded So Good,"Christmas Traveler is one of my favorite Christmas CDs and I'm a major Christmas fanatic. The Browne Sisters and George Cavanaugh sing old standards like ""White Christmas,"" as well as lesser known songs like ""Christams in Killarney."" George Cavanaugh's version of ""We Three Kings of Orient Are"" is beautiful and haunting. You can almost envision the three kings on their way to the manger. For those of you who, like me,cry everytime you hear ""I'll be home for Christmas"" the Browne Sisters version of this timeless song will make you want to call family and friends near and far and tell them how much you love them. Whether you like the old standards or are looking for something new, this CD has it all!"
2,"Works well, simple","Was easy to put up, sturdy, made well, opens and secures easily. Great price for a well made product."
1,Good Basic Information / Bad Quality Binding,"I am a mid-level PeopleSoft developer and found a lot of useful information in this book. If you are an expert this book is not for you. If you are new or your company won't spend money to train you then this book will be helpful. NOTE: the construction quality is severely lacking. It looks like it was printed from a Word Processing program and bound in someone's garage. My book fell apart after a couple of months. The other books from this author/publisher were all good quality, but this one looks like it was put together by someone in jr high."
1,Too Flimsy,"Upon receiving this item, I was sadly impressed at how flimsy the paper and lamination were. It seemed that even a gentle touch put a visible crease in the map. I liked the graphics (colors, etc.) but, unless hanging it on a wall permanently, regular use of this map would wear it out way to soon for me."
2,Embrace this!,"The story of John and Abby and the trials they face in what should be the golden years of their lives was awesome. Ms. Kingsbury did not mince words in writing about the feelings that many of us have when bad things happen to good people. She explores the depths of despair, feelings of anger with God, reconciling tragedy with God's will and ultimately forgiveness. This book is well written and guaranteed to make you think and appreciate all that is well in your life. However, the author always has a message of hope, as well. She has accurately pegged the way things typically happen in our lives - John's livelyhood is threatened, John's feelings of inadequacy in reaching his students, the accident, feelings of helplessness and anger afterwords. Everyone should read this book."
2,ASP Unleashed,"I rated this book with 5 stars because now I can confidently say I can work with ASP. I had no prior knowledge of VBScript, SQL or other Server side programming languages like CGI or perl. It starts with the basics of ASP and quickly leads you to building your own scripts. The codes given are not complete programs so you have to go step by step from the 1st chapter thus building your knowledge from the ground up. Later advanced technologies like MTS and DNA are explained in a simple manner thus not confusing you.Also present is an introduction to future technologies like Win2000 with IIS5.0 and ASP3.0Highly recommened book."
2,Cheaper than the Nano...but better?,"I have been satisfied with this player overall. I did have trouble with it one time (the player froze), but it was quickly resolved by customer support. It's a little slow on start up when the memory is full. The controls take a little getting used to, but overall I am happy with my puchase and use it every time I go hiking or snowboarding."
1,too flat,"The flatware set was very thin and too easily bent. It will do for awhile, but I would not have bought the set if I had felt how thin they were."
2,Good purchase,"an unforgettable tv serie and a good price, I had a lot of fun watching this guys. too bad it doesn't come in HD"
2,"Not What you expect, but great none the less.","I thought this would be a romance movie- just your typical romance movie when I originally watched it on Netflix instant play. I was surprised. Brittney Murphy actually did a great job in this. I won't spoil it for you, but it''s more less telling you before you settle for something you've grown accustomed to, you need to explore, take a chance, and find yourself. At least that's what I got. This is now one of my favorite movies."
1,Awful!! Just the worst!,"I give this a negative 5 stars and 5 thumbs down and I only have two thumbs!!!The WOW CD's have progressively gotten worse. I do not know what possessed me to buy this mess. Disc 2 is much more tolerable than Disc 1...I am a stong lover of Gosple music -- but I am way disapointed in this mess. From the awful song called You by The Bad Boy family to Smokie Norful(????) ye that is his name check the website. Should have left it in the store for that artist alone.I have the Richard Smallowood Persuaded CD, Donnie McClurkins and several others....right now I am reading my receipt and determining what the refund policy is!DONT BUY IT!"
1,The only episode I truly don't like,"This episode doesn't hold up well under the philter of time. A character in the show has a horrible secret that is tossed about a bit cavalierly, once it is revealed. It's unacceptable not only today, but back then as well, I imagine. The studio audience doesn't react very well either.It's a relatively average episode of the show up to that point, but that part just submarined it for me. I've seen the whole run dozens of time in syndication, but I don't remember ever having seen this episode before. Maybe this is why. I've never seen another episode of Dick Van Dyke that I just plain didn't like, but I anti-recommend this one."
1,Did I just get a 'bad' copy?,"I wish I could say that I think I got a book full of misprints because the story I read seemed unfinished. I don't usually fill in this kind of survey-review, but I have to speak out on this book."
2,great,gave as a birthday present to a 7 yr old which absolutely loved it. great product fast delivery.
1,Bad editing,"Release the movie the way the director originally filmed it in 1995, instead of the chopped up version finally released on dvd."
2,great portable seat!,This is a wonderful portable seat or even a great booster for the dining table. I went with this one verses the first years because the gray color is subtle and goes with more then the bright colors. Fits our outdoor chairs and will probably fit any chair you want. It is also the perfect height for my daughter. She is smaller and she can eat right from the table. Highly recommend!
1,Buy it for the cover picture only,"Just because someone puts the word ""Masonic"" on something doesn't make it worthwhile for a Freemason to buy. Such is the case with this CD. The music quality on high-end equipment sounds like it was being played through the 8-track in an old AMC Pacer. If you were looking for music for anything to do with a lodge presentation - or even your own easy listening, don't waste your money on this or its sister product, Volume 1. Really poor sound quality."
2,Forgiveness,"This is a movie about forgiveness. Redford blames Lopez for his son's death. Lopez shows up at his ranch needing a place to stay for a while with a granddaughter he never knew he had. As nature would have it, Redford falls for the little girl. Redford is getting old, but don't mess with his granddaughter. Lopez's abusive boyfriend finds this out the hard way. In the beginning, I thought the movie was going to drag, but then it took off. I ended up enjoying the movie and I think you will too. Redford continues enlightening us film after film."
1,3 of 4 DVDs would not play,DVDs have some kind of problem as only 1 would play. Would love to watch as I enjoyed the series when on TV. Too bad....
2,No more interference from cell phones,"I bought these speakers for two reasons: They were cheap and other reviewers said they didn't get interference from cell phones. All I can say is mission accomplished. I've had these running for almost a week now and despite intentionally leaving my cell phone near them I haven't heard a peep. No more of the jarring noises when I get a text message.In terms of sound, they're not amazing, but they're cheap computer speakers. They're at least as good as you deserve for the price, probably better. I personally thought the subwoofer was a little overpowering at the default level, but there is a control for that and I was able to adjust it to something that sounded more balanced.I knocked off one star because most of the cables are hardwired to the speakers, which I hate."
2,Disney Princess Snow White,I have seen a doll like this one and wanted it for my grandchild who loves it. Quality okay but material not very cuddly.
1,"Great sound output, but...","The amp is great, and fills the room with sound. I can hook up everything I have, and room to spare. Except for one thing, I would rate this at five stars, however, the system is only as good as it's weakest component, which happens to be the DVD player. I had it for a month and one day the DVD player would not power up. I bought the system at Best Buy, and they were happy to replace the ENTIRE SYSTEM, but not just the DVD player. So I took it all apart and hauled it all back in to them and got a new system, hooked it all back up...well, another month passed and the exact same problem, this time the system swallowed two brand new DVD's with no way to get them out. The response was, again, to bring in the entire system and they will replace it. What a bother, running all the wires, hooking and unhooking everything, etc. If I could just get the DVD player replaced it would be better. Anyway, buy with caution and make sure you get the extended warranty from your retailer."
1,This just bored me to no end.,"I am a student of philosophy and rhetoric and have spent many hours of my life buried in complicated and dense reading. But this book just takes the cake!It is not complicated. It is not dense. It is just boring.The idea is interesting, but Hanley spends too much time on basic philosophy and too little on the relationship of Star Trek and its philosophy. However I am sure a few undergraduates would be comfortably induced into an introductory class with this title.If you really want to read the book, read it out loud as though it were being presented as a series of lectures. It is much easier to follow."
1,Haier HSB03BB Compact Fridg. - Poor packing and shipped Dented,"Haier HSB03BB Compact 2-2/3-Cubic-Foot Refrigerator/Freezer, Blackwas received.The packing was dismal as in practically non-existent and the refridgerator was damaged (major dents). This was a gift and the recipient of the gift was shocked to see the damage. The recipient decided to keep the fridge as it worked even though it was seriously dented."
2,"Not totally what I expected, but....","The lyrics in most of the songs are very hard to hear even while following along w/ the lyric sheet except in ""The Loss and Curse of Reverence."" I wonder why it's so clear in that one, but none of the others. Besides that, it's a pretty good album, and I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for some new bands."
1,A novel that takes a bold step...,"Of not including a single likable character! Rado, Thorn, their mysterious backers, the Fact, the Fact's worshippers...there is no one to root for. In some books the 'heroes' are useless and we're reduced to pulling for the villains; here we don't even have that luxury."
2,A Good Purchase,"Arrived on time, well packaged, and rugged construction. Includes all the parts needed for easy install including bulbs. All in all, a good purchase."
2,Destiny's Child's brilliant sophomore album,"Destiny's Child's brilliant sophomore album, ""The Writing's On The Wall"" has sold over six million copies in the U.S. alone and yielded four Number One singles.Destiny's Child were introduced to the world with their debut single ""No, No, No"" and soon after it's release, the single jumped to the top of the charts worldwide and went Plantinum making way for the group that would soon be crowned the Top Selling Female Group. Hit by hit, ""Bills, Bills, Bills"", ""Bug A Boo"", ""Say My Name"" and ""Jumpin' Jumpin'"" all topped the singles charts and became the hottest jams in the clubs and the streets.If you love your R&B music then you're going to love ""Destiny's Child's - The Platinum's On The Wall"""
1,The worst game.,The worse game with the most problems. You can grind forever. The graphics aren't good compared to an N64 game made in 96. Once I fell and got like stuck and the screen jittered. When they fall they make the stupidest pain sound like they had the producer do it. THE WORST LEVEL DESIGN FOR ANY EXTREME SPORTS GAME and we play games for the level design.
2,There never was a hero like Shane,"""Shane,"" a true cinematic treasure, earned six Oscar nominations, attracted audiences not usually interested in westerns, and earned star Alan Ladd (pictured)) a special place among movie heroes.But from the opening scene to the last fade-out, this picture belongs to child star Brandon Dewilde. He speaks for every small boy who ever gave his heart to a western hero.What small boy wouldn't want a hero like Shane?"
1,I would give this book negative 100 stars if possible,I am 17 years old and have been reading this series since Ashleigh's Wonder. This book was completely unrealistic. Don't the Townsends own 1/2 of all Wonder's foals? After this book I have stopped reading this series. These books are way too expensive for crappy storylines that I could write better. I started to get irritated when they switched authors that got horse's names wrong but this is ridiculous!!! New authors should read the previous books in the series and try to maintain the personalities of the horses and peoples. Please write me with your opinion.
1,Poor Battery Life,"I have the same problem as all the other reviewers. At first I thought I was turning on the phone when I was putting it down, and coming back to find it almost dead. After more careful observation, I found out the battery goes from 3 bars (full) to dead within a matter of minutes. I follow all the procedures for recharging NiCd- even letting the battery go completely dead between recharges. The phone is now just under a year old, and I was thinking about getting a new battery, but I don't think so after reading the other reviews. I'm very dissapointed."
2,Great!,Came in time for Christmas. My son is addicted to Buzz and can't get enough of this movie....so much that I had to order the next 2 for him. Thank you!
2,great movie.,A classic movie of innocence and respect for that innocence. One of the great coming-of-age-movies of all time. But that sounds like a cliche. This movie stands alone as a great movie. It's wonderful in it's simplicity. Thanks.
2,Funny Story,We say this in a store where all they had was a floor model that was beat to death. They called around and couldn't find it anywhere. I went online to good ole' Amazon and there she was. We love it.
2,For the money,"they're fine. I couldn't see spending the original price of $50+, but for under $30 these do the trick. The sound is a rather muffled, not nearly and clear and I'd prefer and many will complain about getting them to sit right and stay in your, but, for the price you can't complain too loudly.I prefer more clarity and attenuation, so I'm still on the look out for a better IEM."
2,Finally a good book on an often overlooked sport which,"Finally a good book on an often overlooked sports which deserves to be written about with the care that Vicky Moon has provided in these pages. The book has covered not just the riders and the trainers, but the grooms who work so hard. I loved the stories about the carrot man. It brings together the glamor, the glitz and yes, also the darker side. The first book to really tell it like it really is."
1,"An ""interesting"" book","Ms. Roy had a compelling vision for the book. Somehow thearchitecture and construction cloud the vision and prevent it fromtouching the reader's heart. This is ironic, for the flap says Ms. Roy is an architect by training.What I found frustrating was that I could never get close to the key characters and start to feel for them. Why? Because Ms. Roy continually interrupts, striving to look brilliant herself. This she does using a staccato, ostensibly emotional, style of writing, seemingly endless and trying nature commentary, a flood of parenthetical observations (too many of them, really... RE-A-LLY) and unwarranted capitaLIZations. These divert your attention from the plot and consume your energies away from the poor souls that inhabit her vision.But then, we have to commend Ms. Roy for her accomplishment - getting a book published, much the same way we salute anyone who gets a PhD. For the effort and endurance, irrespective of the quality of the work."
1,Sandra has done better,"Sandra Browns writing has kept me an active reader for sometime now I have enjoyed a few of her novels so far and found this one dissapointing. It seemed as though she combined everything from other novels of hers and dumped them into this one. Sorry Sandra, Charade is not one of this readers favorites."
2,Great value for cottage looks,I bought this for my daughter. She uses it as a sweater chest and she loves it. This is perfect for the cottage look that she wants in her little Cape Cod style house. It has good quality for the price.
1,SWG is now Ruined by latest update!,"Even though the Wookie extension has not come out (which I bought three of and will be requesting a refund for), SOE forced a combat upgrade on everyone despite the cries against it. One of my accounts (I have five) is a artisan and does not fight. They made it so i cannot wear any armor at all and I was killed by a lowly animal just trying to reach my vendor on the gentle planet of Naboo. I have played every day since the beginning of the game and loved it! Now I am forced to leave because it has morphed into some sort of strange game I have no desire to play anymore. It's very depressing and I will miss all my friends and will miss playing with my characters. It's simply horrible and I think SOE must WANT to destroy (end) the game or something cos everyone I talk to in game tell me they are leaving the game also due to this horrible upgrade."
2,Tom Waits has a voice as warm as single malt scotch.,"I first heard Tom Waits 20 years ago and we're still friends after all these years. Waits'voice is at once familiar and comforting and his jazz-tinged blues sound is rich and vibrant. His use of horns is tasteful and hypnotic. This is late night, early morning music when you can't get to sleep and you can't stop thinking about that special someone and what it feels like to have her arms wrapped around you on a cold night."
1,Suitable for lumberjacks,"I had to return this item because it is SO wide in circumference that it would only be suitable for someone who is about 6 feet tall and weighs more than 250lbs. I had been looking for a roller to lie on down my spine to help with issues there, like what I use in P.T. At 5'4"" and under 150 lbs, trying that maneuver with this product was like lying on a styrofoam life preserver."
1,Hamilton Beach 43234,"Not totaly happy with this coffeemaker,it work good no problem there but this coffee maker does not bulid for under kitchen cabinets and I spell water everytime try to fill the water tank, before purchase this product check the sample on floor see if fits your needs."
1,"Touches on a lot of topics, but not in detail","The book has a lot of information in it; although, it doesn't go into much detail leaving me with more questions rather than answers.Also, the book does not cover the current line of HP scanners. It talks a lot about the DeskScan II software which, evidently, came with previous HP models; however, DeskScan II is not shipped with the current line of HP scanners. And the PrecisionScan software which does come with current scanners does not have the same features/capabilities as the DeskScan II software."
1,Junk,"I read the reviews and thought it was cheap, but I'm not expecting much. Well, it's not worth the money spent. I've had it for a month, it's now broken. I only used it as a foot stool under my desk. It STINKS! I let it air out for a week - it did nothing! I was going to sand it down and repaint it is that bad. But, now that it is broken I'm actually happy. I have a reason to throw it out and buy a better foot stool. Save your money and your nose. Don't get."
1,VHS Rewinder,It broke after 3 uses.I called the company directly and they sent me another one right away. I guess they expect that it is not very good. Also I was charged $19.00 for it but the replacement was $14.00 according to the bill they sent me.
2,Thought Provoking,"This is by far one of the best books I have read. As someone who has little time for pleasure reading, I found this book to be nowhere near a waste of time and definitely not boring. The characters are complicated and dramatic enough to be novel material, yet realistic enough to relate to. The issues that Carrie deals with are those that affect every woman in her early 20s. She must decide what she wants from life and whether or not the town of Madison is standing in her way. There are times when you hate her and other times when you just want to console her, but in the end you can accept her for what she is . . . human. Packer's writing is engaging and, unlike some other books being produced lately, not too witty for her own good."
2,Best acoustic SOUND under $1000,"Bought my Taylor 110 in Spring of 2009. Played all the high-end acoustics in Guitar Center (about 30 guitars) and this one beat the pants off some of the $2,000 guitars. Nothing in the $600 price range even comes close. A distant second was the $300 Yamaha, which would be a great guitar for beginners. The Taylor 110 is a no-frills sound machine that plays like butter. Balanced Sound literally LEAPS out of the sound hole and fills up a room. Played in my kitchen with hard wood floors, the guitar gives off a studio-like volume level. This guitar is all about sound and playability; it is certainly a product that will get you hooked on the Taylor line.My tuners are not labeled/engraved/marked either (as another reviewer mentioned, but the guitar stays in tune very well if you play it often.Note: To get the good sound, you simply must string it with the Taylor recommended Elixir Nanowebs, medium. Yes, they are $12 strings, but they are worth it."
2,"""Shrink-wrapped""","Shades of Dr. Kervorkian. Unlike most Dr. Alan Gregory stories this one focuses on a new patient. The patient doesn't want lingering illness to make him a burden to his family, so he hires the Death Angels hit squad to kill him first. As with most judgements made on an emotional level, he is now rethinking this decision........but the Death Angels don't care. Can this situation be resolved? Read the book for the answer."
1,"Enough about Michelle, what about Jeff???","Yes, Michelle P. seems to be every man's fantasy, but for me, a female, check out the way Jeff seduces her by the piano! I met Jeff B. and he must be 6'4""...and sexy. The music tops it all off...Grusin, good job."
2,Hypergraphics presents a solid theory of interactive design.,Most web design books are either superficial portfolio books or aesthetically challenged how-to-do-it manuals. Hypergraphics presents a lucid theory about web-page design and the interactivity of the cohesive website. The sites selected for thoughtful analysis are both well-designed and communicatively effective.
2,"Heroes Great, Amazon not so","The Heroes series is amazing. Just watch it. One of the best shows in recent years. Up there with 24. I hope Season 2 is just as good. Although I don't expect it to be.I bought this from Amazon USA to be delivered in the UK. Because I didn't want to pay for the UK hike in price (over double what it is in USA for the same item). It eventually arrived 8 days late. But instead of being delivered, there was a Customs charge of just over 12 to pay on it (which is still cheaper than UK version!). Unexpected, Amazon didn't warn me about it. It's the first USA Region 1 DVD I've bought. Works fine in my DVD players. Doesn't work on my computer, but I expected that.5 Stars for Heroes, 2 Stars for Amazon.com"
2,facial steamer,"This is a good product for the money. There are some features I would like to mention though. I received No manual for the appliance at all. Also, its difficult figuring out exactly how much water you should add to the glass container. It seems like you have to fill it ALL the way, and the steamer will cut off when it reaches about half way or less."
1,I paid $30 for this????,"I was astounded at the poor quality when I first purchased the Littermaid tent. Then again, comparing this to the littermaid cat box itself it seems that the company banks on having their products break so the customer will (buy another and) get a replacement. Putting the tent together was a nightmare, as the zipper broke and the tubing seemed too big for the plastic liner. The only good thing I can say is that we have had the tent for about a year and a half and my (big-boned) 15 lb cat makes the top of the tent a regular hang out spot. I won't tempt fate by saying it hasn't b-r-o-k-e-n yet."
2,"Tough, high-quality chain lock","This is a great, easy to use chain lock. I can't think of a single design flaw with it. The only drawback is that it's heavy - very heavy. It's long enough that I can use it to lock up both of my bikes together, which is very convenient."
1,the second star is for not being as bad as everyone says it is,"hey, i upped it from one star to two because no matter how bad it is, its not as bad as i always imagined it would be, and i give it credit for that. plus, its got one of my fave actors joe silver. i wont even comment on the song!"
1,Shameless,"Shameless. I cannot believe that in this time where both the TV community and Hollywood have both restrained themselves in a noteworthy fashion that the publishing industry would stoop to such a level. This is only one of the growing number of publications coming out to cash-in on the tragedy. If I only had enough time on my hands to review all of these ""insta-books"" on the September 11 attacks... Oh, and though it's a nice gesture to donate part of the proceeds to a related charity, it's still all too blatant exploitation. We aren't all suckers, though P.T. Barnum's quote rings true just by looking at today's Amazon ranking... #1. Shameless."
2,safety item,"Hopefully I will never actually need this item to alert me, but I activated it right away and so far so good. I like the fact that it is combination smoke and carbon monoxide and also that it talks."
1,Disappointed,"In my opinion, the book does not offer concrete ideas, but serves to market the author's numerous other products."
1,Can't program Memory,"I purchased this phone through Amazon from Atlanta Network Technologies. The telephone works but the memory couldn't be programed to save numbers. I have not returned the phone for a refund because the shipping cost, which I have to pay, is as much as I paid for the phone. So much for a good deal."
1,"If you are into metaphysics, this is one book to read.","I would like to start by saying this is an excellent book. I am not going to give it away what the three magic words are, but I am going to tell you this. Everything you need to succeed is in this book because everything you need to succeed is within your midst. Read this book and learn how matter, time, energy, space is shaped by willpower."
1,Save your yourself,"Don't bother with this movie. Save your time and money. Plot was hokey. At points the plot of the movie tried to be serious, other times it tried to be comical. Tom Arnold and Segal do not mix in this poorly written movie."
1,Quality is not good!,"What I got is different from what I saw in the picture,the material is not the same, and the quality is not good.I returned it."
1,"meh, it's alright","bought this, and installed it 3-days ago. Bought it to cover up some unsightly AC condensers, and it works for that, sure. The problem is, if you can see the back of these units, they look pretty bad. I think most people would use this to screen more than one side of something, and if that's true, you can see the back of these screens. I think 90% of people would be disappointed by that. It doesn't really beautify a yard the way it should. Look for another solution for AC condensers in the backyard for sure."
2,Adorable,"I gave this as a gift to my Harry Potter-obsessed friends and they adored it. It doesn't do much other than shake when you pull its tongue, but it brings a priceless smile to those who loved the books.The wait was worth it."
1,This Game Sucks,This game sucks. You can't play this game using a controller so it is worthless to me. I am sorry I bought this game...
1,Bad idea,"I purchased this $[...] watergun for my teenage son with the idea that he would enjoy having a powered watergun that was touted to shoot a stream '35 feet'. Well, it worked for one outing of about a half hour and since then has only managed to dribble water from the spout despite repeated charges. A total write-off. DO NOT BUY THIS WATERGUN if you have given it a passing thought. Go instead with one of the pump super soaker type guns that the kids can power themselves with pump action -- they don't ordinarily fail in the first day of use."
1,Good movie.... Awful DVD,Enough comments have been made on the movie so I'll just tell you my opinion on the DVD edition. It is one of the worst DVD transcription I have ever saw. I really had the impression to watch a DivX. Do I need to tell more about the resolution? Only the english soundtrack is available (I wish the movie had been shooted in Chinese or Mandarin but that's not the point) and no subtitles. The DVD presents the director's cut which makes the movie 3 and a half hour instead of 2 and a half. The theatrical version is not available on the DVD... Otherwise there is no additionnal material.
1,"It was so bad, I almost cried!","The prose was weak, the situation clichéd and the positive hype. . .unforgivable. The most interesting part of the book was the epilogue, which did not involve Francesca."
2,"Good Pitcher, Great Value","For the $10 or so I spent on this, it is a great deal and the pitcher works great. I live in an area with highly-chlorinated water that wasn't very good. I got the Brita going pretty quickly and the water no longer has any chlorine flavor. It's not the most flavorful water I've had, but it took out the bad stuff, which is what I wanted."
2,"I'm 16, and I still thought it was great.","I am 16 and have my driver's license, and I listen to this cd in the car all the time. It is fantastic, and I like the explicit version best."
2,Rip Torn is never better!,"This film is so great, but it's certainly not for all tastes. I saw it for the first time a few months ago(in a rare screening) and have recently acquired the video and watched it again. Rip Torn is so good as country-western singer Maury Dann. This character is just evil, but evil in the kind of way that one can be fascinated by him. It's a great story in which you spend about a day and half with Maury, his band and his manager. There's lots of enjoyable behind-the-scenes type stuff(some of it is quite disturbing). If your a fan of films that might offend your sensibilities a little and you don't mind characters that aren't necessarily folks you'd want to join up with, you will enjoy this film. I sincerely hope it finds lots of new fans on video-it has all the makings of a cult classic."
2,Excellent a cappella music!,"as of jan 2009, the track list above is incorrect. this is the correct tract list for _It Will Come To You_.1. It Will Come To You2. Fragile3. Twisted4. Dream On5. Oye Como Va6. Strange Magic7. William Tell Overture8. She's Been Around The Block9. You Are There10. Jeannine11. Earth Wind And Fire Medley12. You'll Always Remember The SongAll of the tracks are extraordinary, but every time i play this album, i play ""You Are There"" over 3 or 4 times. they sing a chord near the middle of the song that sends chills up my back! The title song is also awesome, as is ""Fragile"", and ""She's Been Around The Block"" is fun. Recommended to all a cappella fans."
2,A Fantastic Book,I could not put this book down once I began reading it. Vianna Stobal's own life healing experiences along with her instruction on teaching others to heal is amazing. I believe she has found the key to making us all healthier people capable of healing ourselves and others.
2,Let Us All Take A Sip,"Let us all take a sip from the cup of wisdom from which this man creates. This song is at the top of my list of all time greats and I have listened to some music. Mos has proven over and again that he indeed is a messenger and acknowlegdes the fact that he is merely the instrument by which God is speaking to us. He is not perfect, he is not beyond mortal but his music is ""eternal magnetic you should respect it."" Every time his cd walks mysteriously, I let it roll off my back because I feel like at least the messages he's bringing is touching people enough for them to want to steal it.East St. Louis, Il."
1,Useless,Avoid this book at all cost. It was completely unhelpful. It does not even have the correct type of verbal ability questions. And has no! practice exam.
2,A Film Ahead of Its Time,"It would be interesting to know how audiences reacted to this movie when it was first released in 1957. I never knew that African slaves got packed into ships like sardines until I saw the miniseries ""Roots,"" yet in this movie Clark Gable reveals the shameful story of how Africans were captured (sometimes with the help of other Africans) and packed into slave ships, and how cruelly they suffered. It is like seeing the other side of Rhett Butler, a very dark side. I don't consider this movie to be so much a romantic story as it is a story about forgiveness and the hope of a new and better era. I never knew that Sidney Poitier and Clark Gable had been in a film together, and it is a treat to see two such great actors confronting each other. Poitier plays his character superbly--he is rightfully impatient for freedom and justice, yet he knows he has to watch his step or else he will be crushed. ""Gone with the Wind"" seems very shallow compared to this movie."
1,If you want to learn about vegan-ism skip this film.,"This film only reinforced my belief that you should buy locally instead of factory farmed, not that I should become vegan. There should be more reasons to becoming vegan other than being against factory farms. This film is styled like a propaganda film not an educational one. It is simply a generic cookie cutter vegetarian/vegan film. If you want to learn about health and nutritional reasons for becoming vegan then do your research."
2,wonderful product,"I bought this to make bath bombs for both my business and my kids. They love them! This is great citric acid. It comes well packaged, double bagged. I open the bags and pour it into a larger plastic container for storage until I use it which makes it easy to dispense."
2,Long but interesting...,"I was on a flight over the U.S. a few weeks ago and the man sitting next to me looked at the book I was reading (this one) and spitted out to me, ""I have to tell you, that book is a fraud."" He then went on to say that ""they"" (whomever ""they"" are I have yet to find out...) uncovered that Victor Klemperer is actually a Swedish Catholic... I would love to know if anyone else has heard about this book being a ""fraud""?Regardless, the 560+ page book is a long, and at times, a somewhat laborious read. I kept reading because he had SO much to say. The difficulty in reading this huge diary is his way of writing: He isn't a fluid diarist and it is all a bit choppy; however, I just couldn't put the ... thing down! He gives a good account of what the Gestapo did to the Jewish residents of Dresden, and if you want a historical look at this part of Europe during WWII, this diary has it all!"
1,It would have been perfect,"This would have been a tottaly great movie if they hadnt ruined it completely by putting stupid mermaids in it, its so creepy to see half human half fish. eww gross totaly!"
1,"caution, may cause epilepsy","The cinematography in this film is laughable. It is filmed in such a manner that you are made to believe you are in the action...not a bad concept, however the execution here is awful. the screen is so violently unstable, it is near unwatchable. I actually did get a laugh noticing that in a situation where you would expect screen movement, there is none and vice versa. In an intimate moment between the two leads, the scene is shot from several angles including the closet, hall ect. The camera is shaking as if a child who ate too much sugar is holding a handheld, hiding in the closet. Conversely, a scene shot through a snipers scope (where you might expect a little screen movement) is so steady I did chuckle. The movie gets one star from me for some good fight sequences. My advice, spend your money elsewhere, or rent it if you loved the books."
2,Fun food book,"The narrator bakes some bread and puts together a nice meal for Ned, with cheese, olives, soup, and flours. The whole house is filled when the guests arrive, and they all enjoy the meal. The story is quite innocuous- -nothing scary and no tension. The book contains about 400 words."
1,"what the heck is this, not the chan i know.",the only reason you should get this is if you want every chan movie there is. Otherwise dont get it! Dragon fist is fake and boring and the only action is at the end which takes forever. Shaolin Wooden Men is also strange. When i first pushed play it showed a girl getting kidnapped. It turns out if you rewind to the very end of the tape you will see the beginning. It will get confusing from there.
1,I hope it's not the first book you read about the 12-steps..,"Fact #1: millions of people have been helped by AA and other 12 step programs. The 12 steps have saved lives.Fact #2: do they help everyone? No. Some people do not respond to 12 step programs, and some people are harmed and even get worse. It's a shame, but it's true.Conjecture: Is #2 the ""typical"" experience? I don't think so. If it were, there would be a massive, MASSIVE outcry considering the number of people who attend the various *Anonymous programs.So...If this is the first book you read and use it as a reason (or THE reason) to avoid getting the help you or someone you care about needs, just know that you are taking a big risk based on the 2 facts above. Look deep in your heart and don't let the fear of the unknown (and untried) keep you from getting the help freely available in AA, etc."
2,Angel of Music,Michael Crawford has got the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. His singing will melt your soul. The man is incredible. You haven't heard music until you've heard him sing!
1,The worst of Le Guin,"Fair warning! This book is nothing like a novel. It is a series of short stories interspersed with descriptions of rituals, fables, and other cultural descriptions. Although this book is highly imaginative, I found the format distasteful. It was hard for me to grasp the fullness of how these people lived even with all this information simply because most of it was lacking motivation. The characters seemed trapped by cultural expectations and really fail to develop. The plot in the few stories is likewise somewhat flattened by the attempt to continue to cultural exploration."
1,The little flowers of St. Francis,Only two of the stories were interesting and they were short the others were long and Not interesting. No pictures! Disappointment
2,No sophomore jinx!,"The songwriting is original, the vocals and melodies are perfectly meshed. Much more refined sound than TAYF. The band has matured and is poised for great things."
2,"A good introduction to design, materials, and processes","I teach product design at Ohio State to students from several engineering disciplines, and this latest book from Prof. Mike Ashby is exactly what I've been looking for. It gives an overview of product design from the perspective of the industrial designer, something engineering students need to appreciate. More importantly, it also provides a wealth of useful data on a wide range of materials and fabrication processes. In addition, each chapter has a thorough annotated reference list - valuable to anyone just entering the field. All this, and it's a beautiful example of book design, in the bargain. Regrettably, it suffers a bit from a lack of proofreading, as many books seem to these days."
1,the curious case of benjamin button,"What a ridiculous film. I can't believe how much aclaim it received. It was silly, stupid and pointless. This just goes to show you that in hollywood, looks are all that matter.....because that is what sells tickets at the box-office!"
1,Puritanical Garbage,"While ""Keeping Kids"" offers good advice to parents with out of control children, the statistics on various drugs are grossly falsified. Speaking as a research doctor with over thirty years experience in psychoactive drugs, I must caution potential readers of this book that the ""government studies"" referred to in the book are loaded in favor of the US policy on illicit drugs. The ""studies"" are often self fulfilling prophecies -- aka: propaganda.The ONLY accurate study is one done by an independent laboratory without an agenda. Beware: The US government can hire independent labs.Because was written for the purpose of education, it is a sin that children will be misinformed about drug use in the US."
2,Plug and Play on the Mac,"I just plugged it in and it simply worked -- both on my PowerBook 1400 running OS 8.6 (which exploits it as an extended memory hack) and on my Titanium PowerBook running OS 9 and OS X. I have iPhoto set NOT to launch when the card is inserted on the TiBook.I gave 4 stars because it arrived quickly and did the job as advertised with no hassles. (To merit 5 stars, it should have had better documentation and a more detailed troubleshooting guide)."
2,Whoa... What An Album,"I wasn't sure at first if buying this album would be a good thing or a bad thing. It has had many good reviews and much musical hype, but I didn't know if my spending [money] would be actually worth it. Now that I've bought it, I can actually say that it was. I give this CD a 4.5. It is funky, fresh, and at the same type truthful and real music. What I mean by that is ""Whoa Nelly"" is not the commercialized pop one would hear on the radio and get sick of. These lyrics are some of the best I've heard in quite a while. They should be easy to relate to for just about anyone. The CD is filled with great beats that will have you dancing, slow and fast. This is definitely worth the money spent. There are few artists that can break through the commercialized bubbly-pop. THANK GOD Nelly Furtado was one of them to do so. As her talent has been long waited on."
2,Appalousa,I have seen the movie and am impressed that the book was followed veryclosely. I think it is a wonderful western.
1,Oh Please! . . . .Desecrators digest possibly.,"If your looking for real Architectural content, look to subscriptions like Architecture or Architectural Record. You can even contact your local AIA (American Institute of Architects) chapter and they will help out considerably.However, If You want highpriced, bad decorating tips and ads on every other page, not to mention all thoes pesky Ad cards falling out, this is your Mag. It should be renamed ""Interior designers' and thier super rich clients."""
2,Excellent Choice,"In both form and function this is an excellent choice. I have enjoyed mine enough to both recommend or give as gifts to friends and relatives. It does all that is required of a tea kettle and at a great price, being as well made as other more expensive kettles I've used."
2,Great Epic,"Milli Jovovich is a great actress and it is nice to see another Resident evil. These epic movie's are one's you would never grow tired of seeing. Afterlife is another classic Resident Evil movie it's slow in places and slightly different from the first three, but still it is a classic that will servive the length of time and each generation will enjoy these movies. Besides having some great actors in it who would pass up the oppitunity to watch Wentworth Miller or Ali Larter on the big screen with Milli Jovovich, it's fast it's gory and it's true to all Resident evil movies. It's a must see."
2,Food for Thought,"My holistic vet recommended this dry food for my cat, despite it being intended for dogs. She said this is the only dry food she would ever recommend for any older dog or cat, based on its excellent nutritional balance and anti-inflammatory qualities. Following that advice, I purchased the food for my 15 year old cat, who seems to adore the flavor of it, but it's a bit too large for him to chew easily. I'm holding out for a cat version, but until then, I will keep smashing it up for him ;)"
1,Maby in Europe but not here,"I bought this cd reading all the reviews below and there is some talent but not much. Ilonas cd is full of bloop. The tracks are boaring and overswept with simple keyboard sweeps and scapes and already heard beats. The vocals are well crafted with an excellent range but not my cup of tea. Lacking in music production talent! My suggestion for you, Ilona, is to use better producers for your next production and let them take you were you need to go just while you simply stick with the singing."
2,IDAHO FAN,"I'm now on my fifth watch, I love the low profile design. I've had to replace each one because the band broke and there is no replacement bands. This is the only down side I've found."
1,BURN THIS FILM!,"This movie is horrible. The kids are worse than zombies! Obviously anyone who likes this drivel has never seen the real ""Our Gang"" kids. May the fools who tried to remake a classic(in every sense of the word)kids series into a feature film burn in Hell and be forever tormented by having to watch their tired attempt at filmmaking. Whenever I hear someone saying that they liked this movie I have to spit! Ptooey!!!"
1,"Too Much Psychology, Not Enough Q&A","I thought this book would be filled with technical questions and answers to review before a technical interview. Was I ever wrong. Out of 6 parts (and part 6 is all appendices) the first four have no interview questions. They have to do with resume writing, networking, increasing your confidence, making a great first impression etc. etc. That leaves one part for technical questions and answers. Part 5 is what I thought I was paying for and consists of one chapter totaling just over 150 pages. Here's a sample question under the job category of Database Adminstrator: ""What is a trigger? What is the most complex trigger you have written?"" Answer: ""A trigger is a common database element and you should be prepared to discuss how you've used this element in the past- for instance, to implement business rules. Try to be as specific as you can in your examples of the types of triggers you've created."" That's the whole Q&A on triggers. Definitely not enough detail for me."
1,One star only because there is not a zero star option,"Did I really get this book at Amazon? I paid $3.49 for a writing tablet which is what this thing is(and a small one at that)The entire product info page is also a sham even stating that there were only 2 left...implying that you were on the verge of missing out if you didn'y hurry to get a copy. This time, I'll give Amazon the benefit of the doubt but I am demanding the cost of the book and shipping to be refunded as a credit as a matter of principle. If Amazon says 'no' well ya know what...Amazon is not the only game in town.........Update: Amazon is, however, the best game in town. I was completely satisfied with Amazon's solution to the situation. I knew there was a good reason that I've spent well over $1300.00 here besides the fantastic selection."

1,"Poor quality, design flaw","I've had 2 each of which developed faults in the battery connection, rendering them useless, after exactly 1 yr of use"
2,good product,"I love this grinder, very convenience and easy to clean. The control button seems easy to break, everytime lock and unlock the grind cylinder need to pay extra attention to avoid grabing the button. But compare to other three coffee grinder that I had, this one definitely a winner."
1,Fails to be a good reference,"Although content wise most is covered, typography, introductions and summaries give a messy impression and frustrates when trying to find the essence. For example the book's index simply sums up where the keywords you're looking for are found (Little's Law: 9, 202, 213), leaving the reader guessing on which page to find what he or she is looking for. Lacks statistical background info and does not cover data transformations for non-normally distributed data."
1,Defective,"I agree this is a defective controller. This breaks my heart too because I love the feel of this control over any other PS2 controller on the market. The problems are the potentiometers break on these, causing it to stick right or left. Unfortunately, I had the same problem -- the right analog stick thinking I was pushing it to the right. This happened on two controllers. I finally took it upon myself to open both of the controllers up and looked at the board. To my amazement, the construction of the board on these is extremely cheap.I'd pay $75 for this controller if it actually was solid, which it unfortunately isnt."
2,I Think This is To Think,"What is this, these layers of guitars and cellos and drums? What makes me feel like this? Conan Oberst has brought something to the world the world is not ready for. We hide uselessly in its shadow and the more we try to understand its extremely relevent lyrics the farther we get from enilightment. If you are buddist and you beileve in karma, then you should know that Bright Eyes would never go to hell. Even if he thrashed buildings, murdered people, or destroyed everything that has been done to make this world right. This poetry is a masterpiece not deserved by the world in its current state. please buy this album."
1,Don't waste Your $$$$$,"Barely fit on the player, let alone came off easily. It was very cheaply made too."
1,Uhhhh.....,"I read this book during an illness... and I'm only 12 years old so I wouldn't have a very good opinion about this book. I honestly think that this book was not based on the thoughts of a regular teen. Now I am not an average 12 year old.. I take education a little to seriously, but not all teens get kicked out of school( there ALL not THAT ""dumb"" ), smoke(at that age and year ), etc. I don't think this is a very good reprsentation of a ""normal teen"". Holden Caulfield was a very peculiar character. The whole story itself was weird. The book just ended with him deciding to stay home. Maybe it's because I'm young but I didn't really like it ."
1,where is the quality?,"My iWay 350C started behaving strangely after 2 months of extensive usage. At some point during navigation mode, you could see your trail on screen out of the highway, 200 yards off somewhere in the woods. IWay was constantly navigating, calculating routes new maps and newer ending seek for position. Finally it broke! When I restart device, it shuts down immediately afterwards. I will be calling Lowrance customer service tomorrow, press 1 press 2, press 3, press 4 ....."
1,Baby Genius 3 Pack - Volume 1,"My granddaughter only liked the Favorite Nursery Rhymes disc. I wish I had known that the other two DVDs were totally different from the Favorite Nursery Rhymes DVD. The other two don't involve the Baby Genius characters as much, and the songs aren't very catchy and are too slow. Does not keep my granddaughter's attention at all."
1,The Tragedy of American Confusion,"Normally I'd advise against reading this cruel book, but since Olasky is now a close friend and advisor of George W. Bush, I'd suggest it to give an idea just how bad a president he will be if, heaven forbid, he is elected.Compassion is singled out here as a ""Cause"" of social ills like poverty and despair. Olasky has no sympathy for the downtrodden-it's their own fault, he tells us, or, better. the product of liberal bleeding hearts who want to help. Notions of social justice and human rights have no place in the Social Darwinian model of this ""Christian"" whose ideology goes against everything Christ taight and stood for.Olasky is just another tool of the rich. Hoe apt that he is now an advisor to George W., the ""Compassionate Conservative"". If Bush is elected, and Olasky's ideas become instrumental in his social policies, that will be the REAL American Tragedy."
2,great company,product was just perfect good price and good service. don't know what else to say but good experience thank you
1,No Clues. No Reasoning. No Fun.,"This was my first James Patterson novel, picked up on a weekend vacation. I like mysteries, crime novels, etc. and I will say it really was a page turner. I was anxious to get to the end to see who was the ""Mastermind"", since I hadn't been able to tell so far. I was so thoroughly disappointed with the way Patterson ended it. Fans of this genre like to at least guess at who the killer might be. I almost get the impression that Patterson didn't even know. Just picked someone at the end. No clues. No reasoning. No fun.I might give Patterson one more try. He's sold so many millions of books, something must be entertaining. But not this one. I wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing. I wouldn't have."
1,Not a Happy Camper,"I ordered 3 bags so I could get a good assortment. WRONG All 3 bags were the same, sticked together like a brick. No joke! it took 1 1/2 weeks to reach me. Grandchildren were upset since they didn't get theirs. They were too sticky and messy. Spent almost $30 on this. Will not order in the hot months again. But my son loved them. LOL sticked together, sticky and all. What can I say he loves Jelly Bellies anyway he can get them. Unless it's butter popcorn and coffee flavorers. All in all I was disappointed in the quality of the goods when I received them."
1,City desk view of Albany political machine,"Tough review of evils of political machine which did preserve peace, keep minimal governmental services going, keep taxes low and out preform the ""good"" governmental cities in the upstate NY. Hard to justify but it did work. His reporting is best contrasted with Wm. Kenedy's classic history Oh Albany."
2,Awesome,Many twists in the story. A very emjoyable and time worthy. A must see do not miss it. Many that I know are equally attatched to it.
2,Love Boba,I love Karen Traviss books. She is a great military style writer. Another great book about mandos. She was the best thing to happen to the Star Wars line and me and my boys all have read her Republic Commandos books. Check those out if you Haven't yet.
1,the walker in shadows,"This ""ghost"" story is a fairly good read, but rather disappointing compared to other books I've read by Barbara Michaels. Looking for a good Michaels book? Try Vanish with the Rose or Into the Darkness."
1,It would make a better movie than a book,"I bought this book thinking I would like it because I enjoyed the movie NOBODY'S FOOL, but I was mistaken. This book would make an interesting movie but as a book it is just too slow. Nothing happens and the author only writes about the little things. Not even in the present most of the time. It gives the reader the false illusion that we are getting to know the protagonist and his past so that something extraordinary will happen--I gave up waiting for taht event half way through the book and have never been tempted to pick it up again."
1,"Worthless in kindle format, try the actual book","Don't buy the kindle edition of this book. The size of the images is ridiculously tiny. Even if you read the book with the kindle application on your computer, the images will display only slightly large than thumbnails.Completely worthless as an art instruction book when limited to these sizes."
1,No effect for us...,"Alas, this had no discernable effect on my cats. However, the product arrived in good time and in good shape."
2,Lots of color and fun,"Recommended fun!This game combines an interesting alternate history background with simple but fun air-to-air combat. The game comes with colorful 3-D cardboard counters, but Ral Partha sells miniatures also (not cheap though, $5-8 each).There are several add-ons available, including Wings Over Manhattan (which comes with additional urban-landscape maps), Behind the Crimson Viel, and the Aircraft Manual.CADET, an excellent PC application available free on-line ............................. is a must-have. It allows you to make up new aircraft and pilots and print out the aircraft sheets (even better than the ones that come with the game).My biggest complaint is that the publisher (FASA) does not provide aircraft counters with any of the add on modules. Miniatures are expensive and time consuming to assemble and paint."
2,Cool,"This was a gift for my wife and she really likes it. Some of the stitching is kinda cheap. It seems strong enough, just kinda imperfect."
2,Parachute Play,I purchased this parachute for my 12 year old newphew and he thinks it is absolutely faboulous. It is very sturdy and durible. Very nice product and was a good price. I searched several places and Amazon had the best.
2,Excellent chair and excellent price!,You cant beat the price of this glider/ ottoman combo! I looked for a chair for months and never found anything for such a great price until I found this one. My Baby Bargains book rates it high and so do I. My husband and I use it a lot and we both find it extremely comfortable and have not had any problems with it ever. I lvoe this chair!!!ETA: it's now 2 years later and our toddler loves to sit on it and rock and we are also using the same chair for our newborn. It's still in perfect condition!
2,Nice Video for A Movie This Age,"Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.The video was very good, but not excellent compared to new movies on Blu-Ray. I was far from disappointed. The audio was DTS-HD Master Audion 5.1, but most of the movie was dialog. The movie is about 3 hours long, and is pretty good."
2,Great Quality Knives,"This knife set was purchased for my son, who works in an upscale restaurant. He absolutely loves the knives. He raves about the balance and how easy they are to use. The knives are sharp. He also loves the look of the carrying case. I don't know anything about knives, but he especially loves the knife he uses for slicing cheese. Soft cheese residue does not clog up the blade while he is slicing. They are advertised as having a lifetime warranty. The quality and workmanship suggest they will last a lifetime."
1,Romance absent...,"I read Liz Maverick's previous novel, ""Shadow Runners"" and against my better judgement, tried this novel. I can only say that she must have a ""thing"" for a main character letting his/her main squeeze be beaten or killed without intervening. Sorry, but if the main character, in this case the female vampire, lets her ""love"" get carted off to be beaten and doesn't interfere, even though she has the ability to protect him, this is just not recoverable as a relationship. I don't know what was going on between the two main characters, but love and romance it was not."
1,Maybe you should check out other titles...,"Ifyou can rummage through this book, you will find that most of the material on the exam in in here, oh but what a pain it is to find. What a disorganized mess this book is. To top it all off, Burce has been kind enough to include 500 pages of totally irrelevant material. That's just what I'm looking for when I'm studying for a hard test. Lot's of irrelevant exam material to sift through.Which leaves me wondering why this book claims to be a MICROSOFT MCSD study guide?TTFN - Tom"
2,Even the dogs love it,This is so much fun...the adults have more fun than the kid does....if you have hardwood floors the sensor needs to be set real low..and if you have dogs...it will drive them CRAZY! Our Daughter was just learning to walk and this was a real motivator to get her on her feet.
1,"you made me cold, and you made me hard","Have to buy this one, because it contains ""You Made Me The Thief Of Your Heart,"" O'Connor's most powerful and most exact expression of familial devastation. The song anchored Jim Sheridan's film ""In The Name Of The Father,"" here it expiates surrounding detritus."
2,Great Quartz Heater,This is just a quick note. I live in Atlanta in a large house. It is costly to turn the central heat on just to take the chill off a couple of rooms when if you wait long enough it generally will warm up. I have used Holems quartz heaters for several years moving them around as needed. The current model sold here in 2007 is much improved over the ones sold back before 2005. One nice feature is that they include a circuit breaker in a module at the plug end. You can tap that switch to instantly turn one off rather then step through all the different settings using the top mounted switch. I am here checking the current price as I intend to buy a coouple of more of these so they don't need to be moved around. These are really nice space heaters compared to the junk I have tried over the years. They hold up even in the humid enviroment of the bath.I highly recomend this item.
1,Not happy with this book,"I found this book to be preachy, patronizing, and a bit snotty. I expected a thorough explanation of the definition of humanism. I did not expect a lecture on prayer in schools, an abortion debate, or condescending comments and implications about the religious.If you do decide to purchase this book for your child, I strongly suggest you pre-read. You may have specific ideas about how you want to handle some portions of the text."
2,One of the best coloring books I've ever had!,"I'm an adult colorer, but an older child with good motor skills would probably also enjoy this. It does have very small details to color.The cars are exceptionally well drawn, as are the interesting backgrounds, of buildings, landscapes and bricked walls.The cars are gorgeous. It begins with a 1914 Stutz Bearcat and concludes with a 1997 Dodge Viper.I enjoyed coloring this book immensely, as well as coloring the backgrounds of buildings. Some of the pictures have a person in them, and I liked that. Only a couple of the pictures show a car being driven, which was okay with me.I have done some of Mr. LaFontaine's coloring books previously and always enjoyed them. They are very high quality illustrations.I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys coloring, and especially to anyone who is into sports cars. There is also a paragraph of information on each page about the car. There are 44 pages total, so it is a generous coloring book."
1,garbage,had this installed today and noticed nothing going back tommarro and haven it taken off had it put in place of resenator and no difference in sound or performance.what a waste of money im better off with a straight pipe thats what my mechanic told me....
1,So Disappointed!!!,"The Secret Life of Bees will rank as one of my most favorite books. This was proof, in my opinion, that some authors only have one great novel. The story was not believable: it verged on the ridiculous. How convenient that all these events fell into Jessie's lap so she could go through a revaluation of her shallow life. Sorry, but I was so disappointed in this effort."
1,It's okay,Maybe it's just hard to get used to but we seem to be able to get more lemmon peel using a small cheese grater then the Zester.
1,Just Terrible!!,James Burton is a great guitar player. When he is playing behind someone else. This album is just just too cheesy. A waste of money.
2,"I loved the swing, can't wait to see the movie!","I LOVED THE CD MAINLY FOR THE SWING MUSIC, BUT HAVE GROWN TO LIKE THE REST TOO!"
1,Simple,Wasn't that amazing but I have a little trouble in that department. My boyfriend and I bought three different products to try to help but sadly didn't see much results from any of them but least of all this one .But please don't take this to too much heart....if it's easy for you this might be the one but if you're a bit tricky you might want to look elsewhere...
1,"Interesting,but not great.","This was an interesting look into the life of a Geisha,but not a great novel. Where is the passion? Definitely not from a womans perspective."
2,Great Product,"I bought it basically for our Cat..... It drives her NUTS! We call it ""THE BUG""....and she responds to it every time we mention its name.I also purchase it because of the batteries,.much better the the watch ones.....I would of gave it 5 stars but it DIDN'T COME WITH BATTERIES!! Overall its a excellent product........THE BUG (:"
1,"Disappointing, for a group with such an a cappella legacy","Though the King's Singers consistently show that they maintain as consistent an a cappella sounda as any group in the world, and though their sound remains distinctive, this CD, with its orchestral accompaniaments and campy arrangements, fails to appropriately show off their range of talent. With the exception of ""I'm a Train,"" by now an a cappella standby (and performed a cappella here), the CD is somewhat of a disappointment, especially to close fans."
1,"Poor Quality, Not an Aerosole","I purchased these shoes thinking that they were exactly like a pair I previously bought a few years ago. After all, they were Aerosoles - a name that I trusted. When I received them, I put them aside. A week later, I decided to store them for next summer. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and was greeted by a strong petroleum odor. Not only that, but the construction of the shoe was entirely changed. Instead of a leather insole, it has a faux suede or microfiber lining(which material burns the bottom of my feet). The sole of the shoe is made of some type of natural colored gum material, rather than the previous black foam/rubber. The shoe has no flexibility across the instep and is uncomfortable. All in all, I am returning the shoes as they are a total waste of money and from the odor may be toxic."
1,No Manual,"I purchased this for 9 year old nephew for Christmas. He opened on xmas day and wanted to play with it. To my suprise, the boax lacked anything about the contents. A co-worker's child received it for the holiday and the child loved. I do recall that child following some sort of manual to do projects with it. Disappointment Christmas present."
2,Superfantabulous,I've been a fan of his for years.This book was a page turner just like the last. Once you get started it is impossible to put it down. It took me a day and a half to finish this book with all its twist and turns. Just fantastic. KUDOS to Victor McGlothin and what's a Woman to do?. I can't wait for the next novel from him and a movie for one of great books can't be far away.
1,Try Treybal instead,"The book is decent for an undergraduate course but there are numerous typos throughout the book and some of the HW problems are poorly written. The poorly written questions gave many of my students problems because the wording is confusing. Treybal is a much better book; unfortunately, it is a bit outdated and does not have all of the latest separations processes included. I will contiue to look for a better book. I will post the name of any other books I come across for those who are interested."
2,Quick service!,The tags were perfect! Loved getting the large quantity bag. I will definitelybe placing another order in the future!Thank you!
2,Magnetic Blinds,Works perfect on our steel door without any marks. It stays in place when opening and closing the door.
2,"Good coffee, but rinse them","I have had my Capresso coffeemaker for several years now and have used these filters from the beginning. One caveate with the fiters ... rinse them for a minute before installing them. You'll be surprised at how much ""charcoal dust"" comes out!"
2,Dilated Strikes a Cord,"This is by far the best album of the year. Platform was a great album, but what Rakaa(Iriscience), Ev, and Babu bring to the table on this one is unbelievable. From start to finsh you can bump this whole album through, there is not one song I didn't like on it. It by far exceeds my expectations. DJ Premier, Da Beatminerz, Babu, Ev, JuJu, Joey Chavez, Alchemist, ?uestlove, and Ev bring some sick beats. No Pete Rock on this sadly, but the beats get your head noddin. I suggest you get this album right now and you wont regret it. Well what are you waiting for? GET IT!"
2,"Perfect, but for the mattress size","Great crib, easy to put together, and very pretty. Our baby is not here yet so we haven't used the crib. For now, we like it!Sole issue: not all mattresses fit. We bought an oversize mattress and it fit with sheets and a breathable bumper -but without it the mattress moved a little bit and that freaked me out a bit (I had just taken a class of SIDS and the nurse told her that the mattress must absolutely fit snugly).So... Overall great crib but why the heck would the company not make this crib standard size??"
1,You get what you pay for...,"They are exactly as I expected. Decent quality, stamped blades and Plastic handles. After a few trips to the dishwasher the stainless steel blades actually starting to rust."
2,Great Mathematical Reference,"Hats off to Dover: you simply will not find a better mathematical reference with the depth and breath of topics addressed for the money. While there may be more prestegious mathematical reference books (Von Nostrand, CRC) but expect to pay at least $100 or more for them."
2,silver surfer,"I like this figure but theres a few things that made me not like him. I think the paint is very cool, it has a blue/silver mettalic paint effect. The articulation, as always is supurb. The head is a bit weird as its not a good shape. Silver surfer has magnetic feet because his board has a magnetic panel so you can pose him where ever you like on the board, i like that idea.The base for the board, i dont like, its to wobbly and only stands up right if your careful, maybe its just mine...? This is still a great figure."
1,Awful,"I picked up this book mostly because I'm a Star Trek fan, and I like William Shatner. Usually even when a book is extraordinarily bad, I will finish it, in order to, I suppose, give the author a fair shot. I only forced myself halfway through this one before deciding that it was more pain than it was worth. I couldn't bring myself to care about Mr. Cardigan, the hero, or his sorrows. If Shatner was trying to resurrect the pure testosterone appeal of his lost youth, well, I'm not biting - he should have read Burrough's Martian Tales to see how pure testosterone is done. If he was going for torture and internal conflict, he could not have failed more miserably. If that's what you're looking for, forget Shatner. Try Feintuch's Hope series. That was absolutely unbeatable. After my experience with Tekwar, Shatner doesn't get another chance in my book."
1,James Patterson should stick with what he knows best.,"I was excited to read this book after hearing all the hype about it, but now that I've finished it all I can say is ""Don't waste your time!"". This book is very amatuer, predictable, boring, and nauseatingly ""sweet"", so much so that it's almost fake. The way that it's written and the phrases used makes it sound as if a 15 year old wrote it about her first crush. I figured out the ending after about page 30, and spent the rest of the book wishing that he would just get it over with already. A very very disappointing read."
2,Sorry But I Actually Liked This Movie,"It was set out to be aimed at 13 year old girls but somehow it got a wider audience. Most teen movies take place when the stars are in high school but this taked place when they are in college. This movie shows that not all relationships are fairy tales. The theme is giving first love a second chance and while it does give audiences a dose of reality it does seem to give a little too much information sometimes. Julia Stiles is smart in her career choice because while she does movies aimed at teens her films are somehow more serious but at the same time fun. This film deals with heavy issues but it doesn't let you know that it's getting you to think about certain things like teen pregnancy, drug overdose....and so on and so forth. If you are a fan of Julia Stiles or Freddie Prinze, Jr. then I recommend this movie. It's not your typical run-of-the-mill teen flick. But beware guys, this is a chick flick!"
2,AWESOME CARD-GOT ME AROUND WITH GREAT EASE...,"The chip is a well worthwhile investment, I was able to get mine for a great price, and made my traveling so much easier, From Germany to Austria to Poland/Slovakia/Czech, also was in Switzerland, no matter where I was throughout my trip the card was such a help. With rest area places to stop and eat, hotels/motels, and most of my traveling was on the highway but in the smaller countries like Slovakia the new updated map was amazing... I was suprised that in those small towns I was still able to get navigation help from the chip. 5 stars without any doubt at all :)"
1,Garmin charger - beware of Amazon substitutions,"I copied and pasted the part number from the Garmin website to the Amazon search window. What I didn't realize was that Amazon's search results were providing listings for similar adapters, not the specific adapter I needed for the Edge 305 I was ordering at the same time. I made my buying decision based on price, assuming I was looking at the correct adapter from various vendors. I didn't realize I had ordered the wrong adapter until I opened it. The vendor, antonline, won't take back open product and now I'm stuck with an adapter for a GPS unit I don't own and no adapter for the GPS unit I do own. Overall one of the most disappointing online purchases I've ever made."
1,mail and key cabinet,I was going to send it back - it is huge and ugly. It cost so much to ship and ship back it wasn't worth it to send back but I didn't like it for my house. I should have measured first before purchasing.
2,Rocks harder than ever,"This album rocks harder than Perpendicular. Steve Morse has become Purple's guitarist, and it leaves one thinking ""Ritchie Who?"" I know that it is almost heretical, but it is the truth. I also got to see the band in concert and they have lost none of their edge. Unlike most 70's dinasaurs who play as an oldies act, Purple is still releasing albums, and good ones at that."
1,Big Bang is Biblical Bust,"Science's 'big bang' is a biblical bust, a whimsical whimper best left undiscussed. Genesis clearly says it was a WORD, not cosmic self-exploding that first stirred the universe from nothingness to be a recent history's creativity. Take reason's billioned years and lay them bare against the WORD of God's Son Who was there. He proves that It Is Written in 6 Days of am/pm houring - one week's phase - He made the earth from water, then the sky, and on Wednesday the sun, moon, stars shined high, taking the light that already set clocks arranging earth's solstice and equinox, and put it into astronomic spheres before light-instants down-switched to light-years."
2,Most of it is raving...,"but Mike Nelson does deal with some serious issues with his humor. The previews that promise more than the movie can deliver, the over-use of FX, using big budgets to cover the fact that the plot stinks and the actors are second rate. And the horror that is Adam Sandler. On the other hand I look foreward to the day Jackie Chan takes over all our action flicks."
1,"Overkill on the global warming, already","Global warming for breakfast, lunch, dinner and midnite snacks enough already! People shouldn't be brainwashed into thinking what the director/actors think that's called being a nazi. Just because you have the money and resources to manipulate people dosen't make it right. Everyone should have a basic right to be able to think for themselves (free will) remember? Anyway, the one star is for Jude and the other is for Haley. This was a very good idea but Steven turned it into a sap-fest as usual"
1,Old Style Letterbox Video,"DON""T BUY!The specifications are incorrect. This DVD is letterboxed and when played on a widescreen TV, there is a black bar all around the picture. The reason for this is the video is setup as 4:3 with a 16:9 letterbox image in the middle of the frame.Stupid 1990s technology! I thought all this stuff was gone by now. Little wonder the US lags far behind the rest of the world."
2,Better than Season on The Brink,"ESPN is coming out with a movie called Season On The Brink about Bob Knight. The Fix will make an even better movie because it's so positive, compared to the story about Knight, who is so negative. This is a great read, and a positive message to basketball players, and all athletes in general. Mike Kramer doesn't succumb to the pressures of life, and in the end wins because of it. This may be the best book this reader has read in over five years. I couldn't put it away. I heard him on the radio in the Twin Cities during the Final Four. He knows what he's talking about. Buy this book. You'll be glad you did."
1,Very dissatisfied,"This book was over 20 years old and very yellowed. They did nothing about my complaint or return, so Amazon had to refund my purchase price."
2,Best for Programmers to implement XML in ASP,Excellent! for ones who are pro to ASP and need to intergrate XML with ASP! A must buy!
2,Dragon lady,"Excellent movie. Was hesitant purchasing it, but after watching it, This movie is what I call a thinker. Have to really pay attention or you miss things."
1,"Whiny, self-indulgent and dull","Being absurdly coy about the reasons surrounding her spectacular divorce flameout, Gilbert makes it impossible for the reader to empathize or sympathize with her desperate need for self-discovery. Mostly, she just sounds like every woman who's been through a bad time and obsesses about a guy. And yes, it can be bad but hardly worth a book. Worse, however, is her insistence in romanticizing the non-Western Other--Indians and Balinese are reduced to stereotyped portals to her self-awakening. In the end, she may have achieved perceived enlightenment but she certainly seems just as blinkered as she was when she started."
1,A lot of problems...,"A lot of problems, it freeze every time I try to transfer files and I have to turn off the device and turn it on again, is a painful problem."
1,Too much of a 'body glove'.,"This item is NOT good for a Motorola V3 Razr. Everytime I push it in, it turns the camera on."
1,Very bad,"I actually like B movies, but the problem is, this one is so horrible, it makes me sick. Usually B movies are entertaining in their own way, but this one just churns your stomach and makes your head hurt. Bad acting, bad story, and it isn't even ""funny"" bad, like some B movies are. Avoid at all cost."
2,Wont Play on Windows 7,"I used to love this game as a kid and too wanted to relive the awesome gameplay, but was disapointed when it wouldnt load up on my Windows 7. It was worth a shot since it was 5 bucks. Maybe people with more knowledge of computers can hit some shortcuts to get it to work but simply putting the game in and clicking install wont work. If someone finds a way let me know!! :)Great game though! Wish I could play again!"
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOORING,"Very unimaginative album, probably whipped this thing up in a day or 2 on his laptop. Sounds like any other ""chillout' comilation form the early 90's electronica scene... only it's newer. Lacks originality and creativity."
1,Upset my stomach,Had a hard time taking these on an empty stomach. Switched to gummy version instead which work fine. No stomach problems.
1,All I can say is YUCK!,"I have been a Bruin fan for 40 years, and totally enjoyed their triumph. This DVD however, made me sick. BORING...really, all you can do is show the entire taped games? I agree with other people's comments as well, I would have loved to see at least some of the Flyers series, so, so, so sweet is revenge! Any ways, congratulations Boston, and their fans (including me), it has been a long wait, and a deserved Cup Championship. To those considering buying this Disc, DON'T, it is very disappointing to say the least. It doesn't even show any locker room celebration, or the parade in Boston. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
2,Berlin...only better,"I'm pretty sure I'm the only one in the U.S. that has this album. This is a good thing since the album will never suffer from some heavy rotation burnout. It's amazingly good. Think Berlin, then add guitars. Check it out. =)"
1,Wrong edition,"The book showing up in the picture is the 6th edition, but the book I received was the 5th edition. Beware...."
2,jrp,"We bought this for a friends daughter.My wife had read a book to her about a kangaroo that played with a little boy hiding his lost tooth until the tooth fairy could come for it.By putting it in his pouch instead of under his pillow.So we were looking for a kangaroo just the right size,to lay in bed with.One that his pouch was open and not sewn closed,also in this case the baby could be removed.The little girl loved it, and a few weeks later lost another tooth.The tooth fairy had no problem finding it and the daughter had no problem findinga gold dollar in the pouch."
2,Good Articles,"Playboy Magazine (June 2008) is 148 pages and comes with some great articles. I like reading The Black KKK, The End of Newspapers and The End is Near: The Future of the Internet Probably Won't Be as Bright as We Think. I though the interview with Steve Carell cool and funny at times. Another article I found useful was 46 Things You Never Knew About Call Girls. I was split over the pictorials however, Juliette Frette (June 2008 Playmate and Jayde Nicole (2008 Playmate of the Year) were good; A Night at the Crazy Horse and Carla Bruni bombed. Carla Bruni only was on one page and was not even nude and the Crazy Horse gals could have more pictorials. Playboy Magazine (June 2008) gets a B+."
1,Designed for failure,"I liked this product very much while it worked. However, the plastic guard is VERY flimsy. It broke after about 20-25 uses. I can't find a replacement part, so the product is now non-functional. I am VERY careful & gentle with my things, and this is totally rare for me. In my opinion, this is a design failure. Very unfortunate, because if that part held up, I would like the product very well. A shame.I uploaded a photo, with red circles around the breaks, at the top of the page, under the main product pic, so you can see."
1,Do Not Buy If You Play Games!,"This mouse looks pretty cool. But, it lags and skips around sometimes which can be very annoying when precision is needed (ie. playing games) Even on the desktop, the cursor will sometimes skip totally across the screen while you are moving the mouse. It's not really smooth either...if u just look at the cursor, it looks like ur dragging the mouse across sandpaper."
2,Series Quality Remains High,"Branaugh's version of the spiritually-drained, emotionally unavailable, malnourished Wallander is easy to care about and, for me, easy to resonate with his passion. His girly ringtone, and his unshaven face return this season for another round of murders. True the high number of exotically gruesome slayings seems rather implausible, but it's worth the suspension of disbelief to enjoy the quality writing, acting, and visual style. I like it that this set of stories takes place away from the boring set of the police station and the Riga story is the best Wallander episode so far. Best if you have seen Series 1 and 2 already, but mostly understandable on their own without the context of Series 1 and 2."
2,quiet way to make sense of it all,"I read this book years ago when I was in Catholic high school and at the time I didn't fully understand it. Recently, I came across this book and thought it would be a good read.The story of Joshua is a wonderful parable about the life of Jesus and how easy it can be for good people to lose track of the meaning of His life, His teachings, and why He died for us. It's easy to be overwhelmed by ""religious"" people who are closely adhering to rules and regulations. But this book teaches you the true spirit of Jesus... and is an awakening about our current society.As I read this book, I'm often brought to tears... it's a book that I have recommended to many.For anyone who has questioned religion and his/her part of it, and for those who think they know it all, this is a ""MUST READ""."
2,best ever,THIS IS MY 3rd RUG CLEANER BUT MY FIRST HOOVER. BY FAR IT IS THIS BEST. EASY TO HANDLE AND CLEANS REALLY GOOD. EASY TO CLEAN AND REFILL. DID THE HOUSE AND THE RV AND I AM SOLD.
1,DealCat.com,"I ordered a refurbished mp3 player from dealcat.com with the assurance that I couold return it if it did not work. However, I have found that dealcat.com will not answer their phones, call back, ir respond to e-mails. I would strongly suggest avoiding this company for anything product one might be interested in."
2,Good job on e-RPG,"I received Brad's book one day and had it half read by the next.It is well written, very meaty, and surprisingly easy to read.I highly recommend it."
2,awesome!!,"this is one of my favorite albums, and i have a ton of bellydance music!! the different varieties of music on here are excellent and im sure it will have at least one song that suits you! different instruments, different countries and different styles are all featured on this album and its a wonderful mi"
2,My own grandfather,"The book reminds me of my own grandfather, who told me his Stalingrad story shortly before he died.It is a good book, but I only rate it with 4 stars as the German military ranks are translated wrong. We do not have Marine ranks in Germany for snipers. We do not have Marines but regular Army and all the ranks in the book are marine ranks...."

1,doesnot last long,Soleus Air CFM-25E 25-Pint Dehumidifier with HumidistatI purchased this item August 10 2007 from you and it lasted less then 13 months. I do not reccommend that you buy it.
1,Waste of time,The only thing scary about this movie is the time i took to watch it.My grandma watch's better soap operas on tv.
1,Garbage,There is a reason these are so cheap... They do not wick. With the originals I was going through 3 gallons a day. Bought these and the water seemed to never run out. These do not work.
2,Alter Ego!!!,"It is nice to remember those years of hard beaten punk, blonde reggeae.A very rare piece for every THE POLICE fan."
2,Jesus Cares,"This particular song has truely been a continued inspiration in my life. Being spiritually inclined, the lyrics to Jesus Cares is just what the song says in every aspect of the words. Anyone who know God, can say, Jesus Cares. Mr. Barnes keep on singing these inspiring songs that continues to touch the lives of so many."
2,another fine Indian novel involving a family,delightful and fascinating story. Ms. Badami (like many of her countrymen and women) have that ability to present a wonderful and engrossing story of a family dealing with the vagaries of maintaining dignity and a semblance of pride in the highly corrupt culture and society that is Modern India. Well paced and reminds me of many of Rohinton Mistry's books.
1,Jawbone returned within 48 Hours!,"I bought theis headset because of other reviews and a recomendation from the salesman that sold me my phone. I have owned more than 6 Bluetooth headsets and this by far has the worst audio quality of any headset I have ever owned. The first call received was while I was at A restaurant in the waiting area with lots of chatter going on between patrons. he caller commented immediatly about the noise and I could barely hear him. I made another call from my vehicle after dining, and the audio quality at the receiver's end was so poor that the person I called asked me to get off the headsset so he could understand me and even with the audio turned all the way up on my Blackberry Pearl, I could barely hear him.This unit is going back to the manufacturer buy one check it out and return it if you agree."
2,Excellent,"I am a big fan of memoirs about abuse, but more especially about optimistic recovery.I picked up this book by fluke and am so happy I did so. Victoria describes in clear and frank detail the road she (unconsciously?) followed that brought her to the despair of cutting.While cutting is a scary, scary subject, it is clear that this event does not happen by itself and this book takes a brave look at this.However, I did feel as though there was a certain detachment in this memoir. Because I have read many, many memoirs on addiction, etc. I felt as though there was a total lack of emotion in the retelling of this story.Still, the author was so honest and candid and was sure not to make cutting glamorous or wonderful. I felt for this person and appreciate her courage in putting down on paper her struggles.Buy this one."
1,Expiration date; poor service,"Please be aware of two things about Virgin pre-paid:1) Each top-up card has an expiration date. If you are unlucky like I was last time, you might get a card that expires a couple days after you receive it, and then if you didn't notice, you'd be screwed out of $50.2) Don't count on Virgin to help you. Their customer service sucks. Long wait times, unhelpful service reps, and just annoying website.If there's a 7-11 in your neighborhood, you may want to check out their Speak-Up prepaid service, which is cheaper and has better phones, plus your balance is good for one whole year (as opposed to 3 months with Virgin)."
1,Good price but too short,"Probably a good price and the mirror looks well made. But the length is too short, so you will have to either extend the length or mount it at the end of the handle bar. Mounting is easy. Doesn't work for me. I ended up giving it up, or maybe give it to someone else who could use it."
1,mongo57,"contacted poolman about the run and cut off problem.they want the installation picture and the electrians name and number and the reciept.what good is the one year warranty.i do not recommend this product.junk!fist off, i think you folks at poolman are not even are worthy of your name.you sell pool equipmentand do not have your own product help line .i fixed the problem myself and you will never know what was wrong.you rake in the cash ,but do not have a customer relationship with anyone.we just but stuff from and that is what you want.if a customer has a problem you termiate your responsibility from the product and have the customer deal with the factory.you will never see another buck from me.angelo"
1,garbage,"Arrived dead in the water. Not worth returning. Once again, you get what you pay for. Happens with a lot of junk from China."
2,"Beautiful pictures, inspires further interest in astronomy","I thought this was a wonderful book. It has a lot of wonderful pictures and excelent diagrams. This book goes into many different areas of astronomy giving the reader a well rounded bounty of knowledge about our Universe. It is also rather easy to understant. You don't need to be an astro-physicist to understant this book, but after reading it you might want to become one!"
1,diappointed,"This product just isn't what it should be, it will not allow a larger curling iron barrel to go in the slots. The postage cost me me than the holder, so I trashed it."
1,Poor scholarship,"Not only is this book poorly written, the clear lack of scholarship and command of the English language renders the text utterly incoherent and useless. While it is clear that the author holds very strong opinions, there is a clear inability to articulate them in the printed word, which is extremely painful. The publisher should have more respect for the reading public than to allow such gibberish to pass as a text under it's auspices. They should have hired a ghostwriter, as the prose seems to have been written by a semi-literate person at best or a wholly illiterate person at worst depending on what passage you read. It frightens me that one with such little grasp of the language can have such strong opinions, and to compound the graveness of the issue, actually find a publisher."
2,The Powder Review,"This movie,to me,was one of the greatest movies I've seen. I rated it a 5 star because the story is so amazing while heartbreaking. Some of the great ""stunts"" are just so mind-twisting to me that I stared in amazement while watching the movie. The true fact of him being an Albino in the movie just helps the person watching the movie look more closly at the unbelievable things he does. As my mom and I watched the movie we had to grab a box of tissues. I would recommend this movie to anyone because it shows how people act if you look different.In the movie,Jeremy,has to go to an orphanage.What he finds there are a lot of troubled people.The whole movie is based on this one guy,and what he does to change the people that are around him.I think that the story wants to help us,as humans,to try to accept people that may look different either by skin color or eye color or whatever.I am going to end this so Good-Bye.The End"
1,Slicer trouble,This is a nice system and it worked ok but could not get the blade out the first time. Everyone tried to remove it.Noone got it so I ended up throwing it out. What a waste of money!
2,Just a simple hone,The jointer hone is must for the shop. Using to touch up the blades between uses helps prolong the life the blade. My only concern about the product is that it is hard to maintain the correct angle.
1,Descriptive Notation...,I've been reading through the games of Tarrasch and commentaries about his games. I find I have an affinity and grasp of his concepts (which is not true of a large swath of high level historical players.) I was very anxious to get this book and ripped the box open with high anticipation.Imagine my disappointment when they hadn't even bothered to translate this into algebraic notation! I cut my teeth on descriptive notation but it has been abandoned for good reason. I find it easy to sit in a coffee shop and read through a game in algebraic notation but not one in descriptive.If you like or are at least comfortable with a book in descriptive notation then I really don't have any valuable comments as I sent the book back unread.
2,"Easy to use, great tasting coffee","As the title said, this little unit is easy to use and gives good result. Just have to remember to use low heat and cold water. Patience is what help brew a good cup of coffee with this unit. It gives my cheap bag of coffee grinds, that I planned to throw away, a new life."
1,Disappointed,"I had a square mirror that was almost exactly like this for 20 years and loved it. I could cut my own hair using the mirror because I could see the back of my head perfectly. This round mirror is nicer looking than the square one, but it doesn't extend out from the wall as far, so I can no longer cut my hair because I can only see one side of my head. I'm going to order a square mirror and see if it still has the longer extension."
1,What a disappointment..........,"I am a fan of the 1960s George Pal classic movie and when I saw the preview of the 2002 remake I couldn't wait to see it. Unfortunately this movie was a complete disappointment. Where do I start?, well, The storyline is completely different than the book and the 1960s original. The movie has no scientifical explanation and/or fascination regarding time travel in general. The soundtrack does not draw you in. I get the feeling that this film was a quick put togheter project rushed out to the big screen hoping to make it big relying on the success and the following of the original movie. The only thing I liked was the actual machine, althought not as stylish and elegant as the original it is nevertheless a beautiful piece of machinery, more on the mechanical side than the classic one. Overall: MEDIOCRE."
1,Heaven Can Wait,"It will not play on my TV, only my computer. A message comes up saying it won't play in this area or something to that effect. Not happy about that."
1,Not useful for clumping litter,"Well, it was a good idea, poorly executed.Why is it that building a better litter box is as futile as trying to build a better mousetrap?The inner ""scoop"" is not really fitted to the bottom of the pan, so there's a gap between the mesh and the bottom of the main pan.This gap means that when your cats pee and the litter clumps, it clumps AROUND the mesh, and you end up having to scrape both sides of it to get them off, breaking up the clumps and making an incredible mess.We ended up using the litter box part as a litter box, and the liner ""scoop"" went in the trash."
2,No problem with cartridges,Cartridges arrived in good time and condition. They have a lot of cartridges and some of the more unusual ones. (read non-HP)
2,Great for Witnessing!,"This Bible gives you the tools to witness to almost any pagan religion. The ""Easy King James Version"" seems to be true to the original though is has updated words like Thee and Thou, even maketh. This is an excellent Bible for those who may have trouble reading the Authorized King James Version but don't want the message changed through man's paraphrasing and deletion of text that you see in the New Age versions."
1,DOA,"Bought this radio and it arrived DOA. Took it to a friend at Best Buy for install and it didn't work. Had no return options on it, was a total rip off. I would give less than one star if possible."
2,EXCELLENT PLAYER FOR STANDARD/HD-DVD,"I GOT THIS PLAYER ON AMAZON AT $550.WELL WORTH THE PRICE AS MY 1,600 + SD DVD'S LOOK GREAT.I'VE HAD UPCONVERSION PLAYERS BUT THIS IS THE BEST ONE OUT THERE.THE FIRMWARE UPGRADE WAS VERY EASY VIA THE ETHERNET AND TOSHIBA VERY HELPFUL OVER THE PHONE.I'VE RECENTLY PURCHASED THE PANASONIC BD30 WHICH IS A FINE BLUE RAY PLAYER BUT CANNOT COMPARE THE PICTURE OF SD TO THIS PLAYER.IF THE PRICE COMES DOWN AND YOUR LOOKING FOR A PLAYER THAT WILL MAKE YOUR SD LIBRARY BETTER.THIS IS THE PLAYER TO BUY. GET THE FIRMWARE UPGRADE AS DOLBY TRUE HD AND DTS MASTER HAS NO PROBLEM INPUTTING TO MY ONKYO 650 AMP"
1,Not what I expected,"I have enjoyed several of Annes vampire books and decided to give this a try. I am not into torture and humiliation and this book is packed with both. I do enjoy a very steamy romance which is what I thought I would be reading. It was difficult to even get to the mid point of the book which is where I am now and I find the only thing that encourages me to read on is the hope that at some point the prince and all of his ... kingdom will get whats coming to them. If you are thinking of buying this because you like a romance with some eroticism in it this is not the book for you. The entire book is filled with absolute cruelty and .... On the other hand, if thats what you're into then this is the book for you."
1,Surprise! Alive and clicking,"The case looks good and its durable. But, if you use the alarm/appointment reminder or inadvertently turn the palm on while its in your pocket--watch out. The cover presses on the buttons on the bottom. Even in my suit jacket pocket, with very little pressure on the case, it will start paging through the calendar, draining the battery."
2,how to use your brain,"A handbook indeed, to be referred to more than occasionally.One of its major tenets, is that the source of most of our unhappiness is when the world doesn't conform to our expectations. It helps us accept what happens to us in life, not to be interpreted as throwing our hands up and surrendering to a notion that we are powerless to affect our life, but in fact its message is one of empowerment, whereby we act to change whatever we can, and doing so more effectively when we are free from emotional turmoil.The book is about how to free ourselves from this unnecessary emotionalism that many times controls our lives; to learn how to use the awesome biocomputer that is our brain and reprogram it to more fully realize your potential for a happier life.Joe ArrigoAuthor of, The Secret Factor for Uncommon Sales Success"
2,"Fantabulous music, just like the movie.","I didn't pay much attention to the music when I saw the movie, but recently I heard Ishwar-Allah and was instantly moved by the song. Its one of the best songs I have ever heard. I have heard this song more than 20 times since yesterday and everytime I hear it, I like it even more. Anyways, that song made me listen to all the other songs and I liked Dheemi Dheemi, Ye jo jindagi hai and rut aa gayee re. Rut aa gayee re is another one that I love. Worth buying."
2,This is the compilation to get,"It is unfair that the Hues Corporation should be remembered as a one-hit wonder. Their debut album, ""Freedom for The Stallion"", was a soul masterpiece. It contained at least three ballads that were pure magic: ""Off My Cloud"", ""Go To The Poet"" and the title track. ""The Family"", ""Bound on A Reason"" and ""Miracle Maker"" were overlooked gems, too. Unfortunately, only ""Rock The Boat"" was a hit. And it was credited by some writers with the dubious merit of being the song that started the disco craze. But there was far more to the Hues Corporation than just disco. This compilation is the one to get, as it includes all the good tracks from their debut album plus a good number of selections from their two other albums."
2,Should be updated,"In 2006, for the 40th anniversary of the Doors' first album, all their albums were re-mixed and speed corrected (the first album, constituting the first eight tracks on disc one, was 3.5% slow). This version features both the slower versions of first album tracks, and the old mixes. It should be updated.In addition to the re-mixes and speed corrections, this album also needs to get rid of the ""Celebration of the Lizard"" track at the end. That was put here in order to get die-hard fans who have all this material to buy this album. The only part of the song that really works is ""Not to Touch the Earth,"" which was released on ""Waiting for the Sun"" and is included here, earlier in the album."
2,Are these reviews or indictments?,"Frankly, not having known or been discussed in this book, I liked it. I wasn't alive (for much of his lifetime) and really, seeing a little more about him (in novel fashion) proved to be fascinating.Bukowski was an American writer. He is shown in this book with his scars, dirty clothes, and kinda lewd persona. He's real from the beginning whereas it took an awful lot of alcohol, etc. until Hemingway was near as (like those of us mortals....)This might not be a critically perfect biography. It might have needed more research, etc. BUT.... speaking form the perspective of an educated general fan, it is worthwhile, though I don't kow if I'd buy it-- the other biography is probably more of a keeper.... This is a good story, though.....Buy the poetry more than any bio. though!!!"
2,nice,"I gig, so I wont put up with crap. I like this, It's tough and padded well. beats a hard case. It's got more pockets than I'll ever use, but they don't get in the way. I carry it backpack style."
1,No drivers for other software,"Very disappointed with this purchase. Their Tech Support was pretty good although they couldn't help with drivers for other software. I wanted to capture some old VHS tapes. The capture software supplied was poor, I had other capture software, but none would work with this card because Hauppuage doesn't have any drivers for other capture software .I had many other problems while trying to capture. If I changed to full screen while capturing the software would change channels!I returned the card for a refund and I am looking at other cards."
2,Fascinating!!,"Trussoni deserves praise for having had the courage to not only face her demons, but her father's as well, and take them on in full battle. Her prose is fast-paced and brutally honest, yet punctuated with both humor and poignancy. The alternating threads between her life in Wisconsin, her dad's war and post-war experiences and her subsequent trip to Vietnam make for a gripping read. And more importantly, the book is a testament not just to the horrors of war, but to its tragic aftermath for both participants and innocent by-standers."
1,already broken,"After a few months of occasional use, the lamp began to flicker. Now it doesn't work at all. The on/off switch is broken and I can't get it apart to fix it."
1,Not very informative,I found this book somewhat boring. The information wasn't very good at all. Then I discovered the author isn't a ferret expert and I was disappointed.
2,Works as stated.,"Works well, although be prepared to disassemble and reassemble when passing through an airport security checkpoint. Plus, you need a sturdy luggage bag to use with this product. One problem that may occur with this is that not all such bags will fit in the overhead bins on airplanes (especially the smaller jets). So, if you plan on using this product to get to the departure gate, use your smallest sturdy bag to attach it to."
1,Awesome Catholic Pilgrim Guide Book of Italy,This book was an awesome reference on my recent pilgrimage of Catholic Italy with my church. Father Daren and several people asked me if they could use the book during the trip. Made me more spiritually ready as I visited the sacred sites. A lot of information. Thanks!!!
1,Complete Waste of Paper - Page Filler - Shame Shame Shame!,"I was looking for a good analysis of Tootsie. The author gives a few pages of one liner analysis, then 10 pages of long list of single words, double spaced, then another 20 pages of repeatitive pointing out the obvious. Some of the pages are blank. Poor presented. Zero value. Shame on the author and the publisher."
2,Fantastic Wireless Card!,"I get awesome range on this. It's compatible with all of my computers. I travel a lot and I've noticed it has worked everywhere I have gone. I've been to many airports, hotels, colleges, restaurants, and private homes throughout Maryland, Florida, Puerto Rico, Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania (just to name a few) and it has not failed me. It even worked between OS system changes. It worked well for my XP and Vista computers. Very reliable and durable. One of the best investments I've made."
2,my husband read it,i have a large collection of relationship books that i buy for husband to be used as dust collectors. for some reason he liked this one and he did not put it down until it was read. i saw instant results. buy it!
2,Nail Polish,"I have always been a fan of OPI, but this color was not what I expected. I was not a fan of the color, but overall it was a great product."
2,An Excellent Book For International Baccalaure Biology,"This text is used for the International Baccalaureate Program's Higher Level Biology at Palmer High School. As a student, I find the text extremely readable with helpful diagrams and appreciate its completeness. Our school has used this textbooks for several years and we have one of the strongest High School Biology programs in the world."
2,"dry,not quaking","what an experience! well worth the time to read.forget the movie..some parts are unbelievable; but thats bowles..this is a great book to start you on the path to becoming a ""beat""-nik..the heat..the sand..what a lifestyle! wouldn't it be interesting if you could just travel for months, years,decades, at a time and still remember what you are running away from? you can run, but you can't hide.history, time and place are always a part of your present..bowles is one cool dead dude..try other works by him as you listen to loreena mckennitt and think about going to work tomorrow..ENJOY!"
2,Look at the songlist if you don't believe me!,"If you're a Saxon fan, you know how hot this is! If not, this might well be your key to the kingdom. Check this out & see if they're not one of the best metal bands ever! Smokin'!"
1,You've got to be kidding me,"You've got a cop that looks like she may be all of 18, kicking butt on bad guys. Not just a cop, a detective! Like she made detective right out of the police academy. Please, whoever was in charge of casting wasn't thinking. Fantasy stories have to be believable, this isn't."
2,Top Notch Clapton Album,"This one of Clapton's better albums, picking up where August left off. His guitar playing on this shows why he's one of rock's best. The vocals are strong and inspired. He has a great band backing him including Nathan East, Steve Ferrone, and Phil Collins. Most of the songs are hard rock with a few blues rock songs and mellow song or 2. Bad Love, Pretending, Anything For Your Love, and No Alibis are the best songs on this CD. No laid back country-rock here like there was on his late 70's albums."
2,Coraline and her adventures through the door,"This story would be in the same genre as Alice in Wonderland. It is a strange, dark novel that appeals to both the young and young at heart. It is the story of a heroine who must go to another world to save her family and other children trapped there. She is momentarily sidetracked by the appeal of this world where she can do anything she likes, and everything from the living toys to the plays of Miss Spink and Miss Forcible's (her neighbors) counterparts seems tailored to her entertainment. The plot thickens when the door back to her reality is locked and the stakes for her soul and those of her parents are threatened to be trapped forever. This is definitely an interesting story for all ages, another of Neil Gaiman's great achievements."
1,Talented author but the book's ultimately unsatisfying,"Life in Brick Lane is captured with an uncanny, almost photographic realism. And the story of Nanzeen and Chanu's life together rings true. Yet the pace is maddeningly slow and the plot disintegrates into predictability. That said, I believe that Monica Ali is a writer who has been blessed with great talent. Unfortunately, Brick Lane is not a great novel."
1,"Hard to follow, no photos of each project","I am disappointed in this book. There should be photos, not drawings. Jewelry is one of those things that just can't be captured in a drawing. The beauty is lost; so am I when trying to follow the instructions in this book. I have to turn to a different page to find information about the project I am working on and then flip back and forth to finish a project? I am not a fan. Wish I hadn't bought it. This will be a dust collector."
1,A waste of time!,"I honestly think if noone can make a film more entertaining than Citizen Kane, we should never waste our time watching any films. The best film ever made!? It's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard in my life. Do they really expect us to believe that every film is worse than this? Oh my god!"
2,Brilliant lens!!,"I love love love my 50mm. It was the best purchase so far this year! It's a great lens for beginners, it adds an entirely new perspective on photography."
1,NOT AVAILABLE!! (not even for download),"Don't bother clicking the links for 'mp3 download'. They redirect you to a whole other product (not even Springsteen related). This cd (or the music contained) is not available anywhere except through private sellers (around $100).Unfortunately, unlike the other reviewer, I bought the dvd years ago from a retailer. No cd included, just the dvd which, of course, only features edited versions of the songs. No extras.Where's my apology, Columbia Records?"
2,funny and twisted well done,Funny and twisted well doneLoved the ending and the characters along with what the movie displayed....I recommended it
1,Eating Out gave me a stomach ache,"Absolutely awful. One of the worst movies I've seen this year. Feeds into every negative stereotype I can think of about gay young men. It isn't all that flattering to women either. In fact it is very insulting.Some will say this a fluff movie that should be enjoyed for what it is. I like fluff. Movies like Trick, I Think I Do, and All Over the Guy are romantic comedies that entertain without being too serious. The problem with Eating Out is the terrible writing and predictable plot.The performances aren't all that inspiring either. To be fair Ryan Carnes is very handsome (he really does remind me of a young Brad Pitt) and delivers a decent performance. But the other actors reek. In particular, the Gwen character played by Emily Brooke Hands is so completely over the top that watching her creates a desire to turn on the oven to 350 and break out the honey glaze."
1,Falling Apart in Less than 2 Yrs,"I purchased this Bible less than 2 years ago and my wife purchased one shortly after I did. Both Bibles are already starting to fall apart. Sections of the Bible are starting to loosen from the binding. The cloth binding material is pulling away from bound pages and I can see that before long the Bible will become useless. The same thing is happening to my wife's Bible and she uses it less than I do my own.I am a pastor and I bought this Bible to use as my new study and preaching Bible. I have already invested great time and energy into making this Bible special. I use it daily and it already has several notations in the text and margins. My Bible is the most precious possession I own. I do not treat my Bibles poorly. I had high expectations of this Bible, but it now seems apparent to me that it is of inferior quality to my old NASB which after 15 years the binding is in better tact than this one."
2,memorex 32023288 DVD recorder,Recorder setup instruction is not clear. To install Nero suite software the DVD recorder must be connected and powered on. Nero application won't recognize the recorder if it is not connected during the software installation.Except for this minor problem the performance of the recorder is excellent.I had to get a program to convert format of existing audio file in the hard disc because Nero suite does not have this function. It has this function only recording the files from CD to hard disc.
1,Not Vista Friendly,"Not only does Belkin not provide a Vista patch, I have more difficulty with the router than I'd ever imagine. It often drops my connection, which is only remedied by resetting the router. I'm also not able to set up a secure connection and am left open to others connecting without my permission. Would I recommend this product? Not for vista users planning on a wireless connection. It works fine for my desktop using a cable, but what's the point of going wireless if you need to manually connect for a steady connection?"
2,Wii wirelss controller,Works great and fast delivery. Thanks for shipping to an FPO. It gives us in the military a way to get things we can't buy overseas.
2,Warning: This DVD's format may not be readable by all players,"The BBC Worldwide video (Released March 27, 2007) consists of two discs. Disc 1 has the season two episodes and disc 2 had the Christmas special. Disc 2 uses the DVD-5 standard format and I have no trouble reading it. But disc 1 uses the DVD-9 format and neither of my players can read it. (See Wikipedia for a description of DVD-9. They are dual-sided, dual-layer discs with a capacity of 8.54 GB.)My players are a 2010 Sony Blu-ray player (model BDP-D370) and an older Panasonic DVD player (model DVD-F87S.)I can play disc 1 on my 3-month old PC which uses a Sony Optiarc model AD-7280S reader/writer."
2,Great for your shredder,"First of all, the price for this bottle is a great deal. I recently brought a shredder and purchased oil for it since I did some research and oil was recommended to keep your shredder running smoothly. It's doing a great job on maintaining my shredder. I put some oil on a piece of paper and use it on my shredder about two times a month."
2,Good for teenagers,"It would make teenagers and young adults think about human life.The beginning of the movie was a slow start, but the last half was awesome."
2,Enjoyable but over-hyped.,"Seriously? I enjoyed the book but it is so outrageously over-hyped I have to wonder what a spoiled pack of brats the people who consider this book to be life changing are.Quick summation of the book. Life is not fair. People with power and control will find a rationalization for their power and hence an excuse to demean you. If you don't have something outside of your immediate circumstances to look forward to you will be broken.Enjoyable read, ridiculously over-hyped."
2,Just what I was looking for!,"This box fit perfectly into my dresser and holds everything! I was really looking for something to hold my necklaces and rings, and this does the trick. Its got plenty of space and looks very pretty. Now I can start wearing my jewelry I forgot that I had :)"
2,Hard To Put Down,I found this book easy to read.The two main characters grabbed me right away.There is alittle mystery and romance bound together in this book. I felt Andrew's character;was heartwarming and tender.I enjoyed this book immensely!
2,Easy to read and hard to put down,"By using a baseball player as a detective, Troy Soos, givesus the possibility of finding the murder together with him, because his hero is nothing special and the lines of thought are very common.Different from other detective books, in which the authors try to create a very difficult line of thinking to make the hero look greater than an normal human being, Mickey the hero of Troy is just that: A Normal Human Being."
1,disappointing,"I'd first like to say that I have had the same type of headphones in the past. So, I knew what these headphones should feel and sound like, but the Coby headphones are a disappointment. Don't waist you're money... These headphones are not worth it."
1,not water resistant,"Initially disappointed by the shipping time. Watch arrived nearly a week after Amazon estimated it would.Then, wife wore the watch for about a week. In the swimming pool a couple time as well. Moisture got underneath the plastic face of the watch and fogged up the display. I don't notice this problem mentioned anywhere else in the comments for this style Ironman, but several of the other styles do have similar comments (guess it is a risk you run to get one that is truly water resistant).Returned the item and will buy one from Walmart locally. Since there is the possibility of it happening again, would like the quicker return process my local Walmart will provide."
1,Broken Out of the Plastic Packaging...,"After having read the other reviews on this thermometer, I should have been adequately warned . . . but I ordered anyhow. Now I have an expensive rattle. It seems as though some people have had good luck with this thermometer, but I would propose that that is all it is, luck. It seems as though the ""exact specifications"" of the Taylor company are not quite up to Six Sigma standards. Despite the box having been adequately packed, with nary a bend in the box upon arrival, the flaming thing won't turn on. Further, the little bit of trouble shooting provided on the package and on their website has not resolved the issue and it is impossible to get through on their service line. If it wouldn't void the warranty, I would love to look inside to find the source of a rattle which I would assume is a broken connector or loose screw. Instead, I'm going to deal with the hassle of getting this thing returned or replaced. Learn from my lesson and stay away."
1,Horrible,"The plot seemed neat enough, and I thought it would be really good based on that fact, but I was seriously wrong. I didn't even finish the book it was so terrible. I read to chapter 4 in the hopes it would get beeter, but it didn't. It was super confusing with all the verbiage used. It was just too hard to follow along with the sentences with all the superfluous stuff going on. I can't beleive that people actually liked this book! I'm so glad I only checked it out from the library and didn't have to pay even a penny for this one!"
2,Onkyo SKW204 Bass Reflex Powered Subwoofer,"Sounds really good, we didn't know how much of a change in sound it would make until we watched a movie after the installation.Great product!!"
1,Broke After Several Months,It was a great leash but broke after 4 months of use hence I would have to say it's cheaply made. Too bad it was a good leash when it was in active service.
1,not worth all the hype,"Daniel Silva is one of those authors whose name gradually becomes familiar. I decided to pick up some of his novels after hearing favorable reviews on his latest book. I have just finished the Kill Artist and it was......OK. In my opinion, it took a long time for the plot to develop, halfway through the book I was ready for some kind of action. I also soon grew tired of the flashbacks and wanted the story to progress in the here and now. The novel did improve near the end but by then I was just slogging through the thing.Hope the next one I read is an improvement."
2,"Less action, more descriptive","I absolutely love Brook's Shannara series, and it was time to pick up this introductory series to ""the Word"" as mentioned in the Shannara books. I was very surprised to find a different pace and writing style than I had become accustomed to in the other series. The action is buried in tons of descriptive element (how many times can you describe the same park?). Although Brook's writing is always great and his wide and talented use of vocabulary kept me going, I grew weary of reading this book at times. This is a book I was able to put down quite easily to attend to daily life, unlike Terry's other books which were glued to my hand from start to finish."
2,Zany!,"Truly a product of its time, it is wacky but poignant, a little cliche', a little bit naughty, but certainly fun."
1,Stopped working after 2 uses,"I bought this item due to the reviews here. We had considered the Cuisinart popper, but it had horrible reviews. Well, the first time we used the Presto, it was fine although VERY loud! Because of the reviews, I was prepared for the popcorn flying out, so we used only 1/3 cup of kernels and the resulting popcorn was great. Second time, perhaps more unpopped kernels, but still the popcorn was good. Last night my husband plugged it in and no bueno. The thing is dead. Good thing it's only $20 or so, but what a piece o' crap! Save your money."
1,Horrible Remastering! Disappointing Performance!,"This recording represents one of the worst remasterings of a stereo, studio recording on a major label that I've ever heard. The treble is shrill and crackly from start to finish. It's almost unbearable!Further, Barenboim seems not to have the part under his fingers throughout: his playing is often so sloppy as to give the impression that he was not only sightreading but also drunk or stoned or something."
1,Pretty Usless!!!!!,"For the few moments I played it, it was pretty cool. You do duties for your camp, talk to people, and do challenges. But when I ran it the first time, I had no curser. The time I pressed the right button, it worked a little. It kept freezing. It could just be the computer."
2,Challenging,"It is a completely new look at the real historical scenery 2000+ years ago and from my point of few, factual happenings, mythology from every corner of the ancient world. It takes quite some reading and will keep me busy for a long time."
2,Good Syrups,I bought these flavor syrups to put in protein shakes.. they taste good.. no aftertaste.. and the best of all.. no calories..
1,Political agenda,"The author has a political agenda and an extremist point of view that she repeatedly rams down your throat. I thought this was on par with such fantastic books as Marley and Me, but this was not the case at all. The writing is fair, the subject matter gets hijacked for her political views. Why does she assume that we want to hear her political viewpoint when purchasing a story about a pet pig? Very disappointing."
1,Take this bio-mod to the trash bin,"This game is terrible in every way possible. The graphics actually take a step backward from the first Deus Ex. The RPG element that was so great in the first game was hacked into pieces for this game, making it nearly unplayable. The plot is perhaps one of the worst I have ever encountered. The maps are small, which means very little exploring.Overall, this game is not worth the box it comes in. I am very disappointed that Eidos would slap together a game like this and unleash it on the public. Shame on you Eidos. We know you are capable of so much more!Deus Ex Invisible War = Terrible = Buy Deus Ex Game of the Year Edition."
2,The Night Sky 40 - 50 degree,I was amazed at how quickly my product came and it was just like it was pictured.
1,Cheap plastic,"It's a bummer that the plastic isn't flat on the bottom. Everything rolls into the center, making it hard to organize anything (like toiletries) inside."
2,Fun!,"We enjoyed this movie when it was released about 15 years ago so we thought we would like to see it again; we were not disappointed! This is one of those 'timeless' movies that can always be enjoyed. Ordinarily I do not care for the gratuitous nudity in so many movies today. However, the brief nudity in this movie is funny rather than offensive."
1,THIS IS A HORRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY,"I recently bought this item at a locaL toysrus store, I went home and hooked it up, i started adjusting the brightness and the machine broke. Now my brand spanking new t.v is ruined!!!"
1,Durability - 0!,"My 5 year old was very excited about receiving this watch as a birthday gift, and equally distraught when it failed within 30 days. The crystal scratches easily. The watch is supposed to be waterproof to 99 feet and the case was never opened; but the crystal was full of moisture bubbles after he swam with it on (and he was at the surface at all times - not nearly 99 feet). Needless to say the thing stopped working shortly thereafter."
1,unmatched bad sale,"The real product delivered to me is not same as that shown on amazon's website. It really misled me and made me waste my money on unuseful thing. Because the unwaived fee for shipping back, I have to keep it. I will not make a purchase there again."
2,fantastic,"I like the durability of the product, the multiple compartment for the knife and other cooking tools. The shoulder straps rest comfortable on the shoulder during rushing to class."
2,Entertaining Book,Pretty good book. I really like this series overall - the Black Magician Trilogy is a simple and fast read but entertaining.
1,Cleaning encyclopedia,"Might be a good book, I really couldn't tell you because the print is so small! I can read just about anything without glasses except some fine print. This is what I consider fine print! I wish I would have known this before I ordered it."
1,Disgusted,"Being a Greek myself I was incredibly disgusted and offended by some of the claims that were made in this book. The broad generalities were ridiculous. Not all sorority girls get drunk have sex and are anorexic. In fact over 20 of my 50 members do not drink and we're not even allowed to have scavenger hunts because it is nationally considered ""hazing"".More offensive than the picture she paints of sorority girls was the fact that she shared so many secrets about ceremonies.A great deal of the information she acquired are things that we in our sorority have NEVER written down but has been passed down for over a 10o years through traditions and secret ceremonies. I was upset to see some of these things written down in a book that bashed the greek system.I'm not saying all greeks are perfect but to conclude that most are like the ones in this book is just upsetting."
1,Do not buy,"I bought this locally and it looks great, but that's all. It doesn't cool when it needs to. The hot water is always hot, but I don't use it unless I'm eat cup o noodles. The cold water is only really cold in the evening. I need it cold when I drink it."
1,A crap shoot,"Judging from the other reviews some lots of Memorex Music CD-Rs work fine, others are lousy. The two packages I bought didn't record properly about 70% of the time, entailing waste of time as well as money. If you're satisfied with a 30% success rate or want to try your luck, by all means buy this product."
1,"Good performance, poor video quality","Muti's performance is acceptably""Mozartian""- and the singers do justice to the roles. The production is what one might call ""opera house standard.""However, the video rendition is atrocious - perhaps the translation from European to American video standards was ""too much"" - the images are ""jumpy"" and erratic- it's distracting in the extreme. Turn off the monitor and listen to the performance."
2,Great Value,This is a great pedometer. It works clipped on or inside your pocket. The seven day memory helps keep track of your progress.
2,Finally... a book that tells us how it works...,"I would have to agree with this book 100%. Although, I can understand why feminists get upset over the old-fashioned ideas The Rules has to offer, they should realize it's not an issue about women's equality... it's an issue about how to deal with a different species--> men! Let's face it, men and women are different, hence, we have to go about things in a different way"
1,L-Lysine 500mg - 50 Tablet,I liked that the product is natural with lessharmful chemical fillers.But I didn't notice any added health benefitfrom taking the L-Lysine.
1,This CD really stunk,"I should have given it more of a shot other than ""I got a Girl"" and I did, and despite TRYING to like it, it's just sitting in the back of my collection. I saw that the average rating of the CD was 4 stars, and I wanted to take it down a peg, so here I go... avoid it, there's much better stuff out there"
2,Good Deal,"I saw the same item at Bestbye for $135 and bought it here for $78. Easy to mount and overall a very good deal. I am very happy with it. Fits like it should for my 42"" Sony."
2,"A great deal ... and a ""must have"" !","Dan Ablan has, IMHO, done a superb job with his newest ""Inside Lightwave"" book.I also own Inside LW 7 and was concerned that the new version would be only a ""rehash"". Nothing could be further from the truth.The book has a new approach, starting with a simple tutorial to get you started. The chapters are packed with information and tipps that give you a feeling of accomplishment. A lot of different subjects are covered (incl. the new and exciting features of LW 8), in good-sized chapters that are easy to follow and digest.That alone would all be worth the price, but once you discover hours of video tutorials on the accompanying DVD, you know that you got more than your money's worth !A great deal ... and a ""must have"" !"
1,Think twice - do your homework first,I recently purchased the Andis Deluxe Pet Clippers and they are not very good. The hair gets all clumped up and it's not cutting the hair. I've been cutting my dogs hair for 2 years and this new purchase was a wrong decision. I should have done my homework first and read up on product reviews. They look nice. Too bad they don't work. Time to look elsewhere.
1,I love Creed,"My kids got me into Creed, and I love their music.Gave me some faith in what our kids are listening too. I like how deep their songs are, and the thoughts that they can come up with on God. It brings you to a different level on spiritual side of music and a new way to think with their heavy words. But you have to hear what they are saying, there is a measage in every song. I like all three Cd's My own prison, I would have to say is my favorite."
2,Numb3rs - 2nd Season,"I'm a high school math teacher so I use these videos as part of my classes. Texas Instruments provides activities to do along with each episode of NUMB3RS. Every few weeks, we do some of the activities for an episode and then watch the episode in class. The kids love this show and they remember the math from the shows."
2,Stirling is great,He is one of my favorite authors for alternative history. Well thought out and realistic in its way.
2,Great Rubbermaid Product,The Rubbermaid small dish drainer in black is just the right size to fit the small side of my new stainless sink and goes well with granite counter and stainless appliances. Rubbermaid dish drainers have always been top quality and this is no exception.
2,MADE INTHE USA!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"All cotton, and made in the USA.In a time when it seems NAFTA and GATT are making jobs are our chief export, it's nice to find good quality made at home goods!We owe it to ourselves to promote from within.I am not unionactually a stone cold pro-life republican. But I know these are good items and provide jobs to taxpayers!!!"
1,false advertise,White they claim this thing could pick up the signal from 1-2 miles range. It only pick up signal around 70 feet.IT WILL NOT do anything beside boost the signal from 1-2 bars -> 4-5 barsIt will not pick up any signal that your laptop would not.So only buy it if your laptop can pick up a signal and you want to boost it.I take this thing to 11 TH FLOOR and direct it to my campus which is 1000 feet (0.2 miles) away and I cannot pick up the signal.THINK ABOUT IT.This will only pick up the signal not the signal tether. So It can only pick up as long as the Wifi router send the signal to it. So if the wifi router can only send the signal as far as 100 feet then even with the 1000$ wifi adapter you cannot pick up the signal if you are 101 feet away.
1,Don't Do It!,PLEASE don't buy this!! At some point these companies have to learn a lesson about taking advantage of consumers. The only way that will happen is if we don't give them our money -- especially for things we've already bought!!
1,Waste of paper,"This is the first book I ever threw into the recycle bin instantly after reading it. There is ZERO instruction on how to do anything, just stories about past investors. LAME.I want my dollar back!"
1,Misleading as to size,"I will be traveling to Brazil with my diabetic 16 pound cat. I read the reviews over and over because I was afraid my cat wouldn't fit in it. The 18 inches long includes the wheels. The real lengh is 16. There is no way my 16 pound cat would fit comfortably in there. Only if she were smashed during the 15 hours trip. Since it's said here that it will carry a 22 pounds animal, I decided to buy it. I guess my husband will use it as a backpack now... and we'll have to buy another carrier for the trip."
1,not worth it,Bought my wife this charm for a stuffer. Not only does it looks cheap but the pearl came off the pendant and the chain is as thin as my hair.Find another pearl!
1,Childish but not a children's film,"Nothing hung together! Watch it to see some Cage high anxiety facial expressions and a couple of scenes of him running. But then once you have the idea that he is stressed, fast forward to a couple of good disaster scenes. Then maybe look for another film to watch.I won't bother to list all the ways that the various parts of the film did not hang together LOGICALLY because with hundreds of reviews and comments before me surely these must have been covered and I don't want to be here all night just to defend saying that this was a silly film. I am pretty forgiving about big-buck films and small-buck films. But this one was a bomb across the board however one want's to classify it. Even seeing it largely as a religious film it falls quite short of the average ones that make the big screen. Of course it is above Bibleman, even though Bibleman does actually does move some viewers and get a few high ratings."
2,Don Lewis takes NY by Storm!,"This is an excellent album, being a fan of The Don Lewis Band for quite sometime, I am in awe over this album. Don has taken alot of time putting it together, seeing the band live and the energy that comes from each of them makes your time with them more enjoyable. So if this band ever stops near you, make sre you drop in to take a listen."
2,BLEW MY MIND,"Not for every one, for sure, matter of fact most will have trouble getting through it, but you can say the same for Joyce. Some people though have sweet spots and this one hit mine. It's like this, if I met you or knew you, the if I reccommended this book to you then it would be a complement to you. China is increditably creative, perhaps the book has faults but when you present this mountain of creativity who really cares or notices. Just stumbled on the book, knew nothing about it or the author, just killing time in a book store and the staff had given it an award. That makes it twice as special.Question: who or how did anyone proof read this thing?great book for those who read slowly."
2,On Grief and Grieving,I was very pleased with the service and the books arrived on time and was everything I expected. I haver purchased other items previusly and have always been pleased both with product and service.
2,Give Me Luna Or Give Me Death,"I love Luna. I'll admit I'm prejudiced. I have been a fan for a long time. But I thought Luna could never top The Days Of Our Nights. I was wrong. Songs like 1995 rock you into a state of shock and songs like Romantica sweep you into a state of tears. Dean's poetry has never been sharper, nor has the interplay of the band ever been more pure. Britta is an excellent addition to the band, not just for her chops but also for her beautiful voice, highlighted on Mermaid Eyes. The record I drift to sleep with every night and wake up with in the morning. Everything that is good about rock music is here."
2,Too short,"I was disappointed to find out that this is too short to fit over microwaveable soup bowls. Otherwise, it does the job."
1,Glorification of Suicide,"I hated this movie. It glorifies suicide and cowardice and calls it heroic. It is pathetic and horrific at once how casually this filth is touted to the eager masses. Sadly some people with connect Will Smith with the twisted message and cheer because they are told it's a feel good, inspirational movie by the marketing team promoting the movie."
1,I might have loved it...,"..if it would have worked. After days of customer support calls, I decided to cut my losses..."
2,Very Cool,"This vest was better than I expected. The product is the same as the picture. The vest is fully adjustable, and great for running around during airsoft games."
2,grandchildren love them,"I love them, the grandchildren love them and I have spent much less than buying them retail at the local store."
2,Boooty shake ain't dead!,"Man, BASS music ain't dead! It's about time Atlanta's DJ Smurf came back out to show all you flaw-a## busta'a that this bass thing real! This cd is a non-stop mix of booty jams, guaranteed to get the party crunk! If you grew up on bass music like me, or you ain't heard a bass release worth pickin' up, this cd is here to blow you away! Pick this cd up and pop in you your system, then you'll remember why you love bass music so much!"
2,Boba Fett...LIFE SIZE!,As a huge fan of Star Wars and ESPECIALLY Boba Fett...this is a great addition to my man-cave. He stands outside my office and is a great decoration. Well worth it and is very detailed.
1,I certainly missed something...,"I also read a glowing review of this Booker award nominated novel, rushed right out to buy it, and must confess that my copy went straight to the local library sale within a week. I thought that the art history topic would be an enthralling component of the plot. Nope. Although I don't have an intense academic art background, I have taken a few courses and was surprised that the author couldn't spark more than passing interest in a complete new world of art historians, auction houses, etc. Ah well, at least the character development should be something special. Oops. No again. Other reviews saw this novel peopled by flawed but humorous, true to life subjects. I only read about fairly unintelligent, selfish, yet surprisingly boring characters. I frankly didn't care all that much about what happened to them. This author is off my list...."
1,Junk,"Received Player but couldn't open the box for a month.Never worked. Never played one tune.Amazon should removed this junk.Since I tried it after the return period offered by Amazon, I stuck."
2,micro wave popcorn popper,This popper works fairly well excpt that u must use an insert to get maximium popping experience. so when u run out othe insert which are included(5) u must buy refills a real pain in the neck.
1,Fascinating listen.,"If you've ever thought to yourself, ""Man, i love Meatloaf's Bat Out of Hell albums. But HOW could i capture that magical feeling for the holidays?"" Well, you've found it. That's right, folks. If you always thought that your holiday music didn't have enough electric guitars mixed with a New Age sense, then you came to the right place.How about this. How about the first two Manheim Steamrollers Christmas albums. They have carols dating back to the Middle Ages, many somewhat unknown, played in the classic style, with classical instruments. And yes, others are new age. Luckily, they don't really mix them in the same songs...and NOT with Meatloaf style electric guitars."
2,Monterey Shorts Full of Great Surprises.,"Monterey Shorts is a wonderful collection of short stories that range from humorous to quite thought-provoking.My personal favorite is ""Monte-Ray Gunn,"" a short story by Byron Merritt about a futuristic cop and his alien partner. Although this story is reminscient by Phillip K. Dick's writings, ""Gunn's"" one disapointment is it lacks Phillip K. Dick's knack of using futurism as social commentary.A close second for my favorites would be ""The Lizard Catcher.""Be sure to keep a close eye on these writers as I foresee future great projects."
1,I was there and it did not work this way.,"I got to 20% and couldn't read any more. I understand that this is supposed to be fiction, but it is just too far from the reality of how things worked. There isn't a Drill Sergeant in the Army who would allow the behavior portrayed in this story. Nurses do not get Jeeps issued to them for personal transportation. I served in the US Army between 1966 and 1969."
2,Great and Silly episodes,"The DVD's are well coordinated and the menus are easy to follow. The clarity is excellent.Farscape was (and I specify was) one of the best new SciFi series out. I recommend all episodes in season one and season two however, starting with the ending of season three it has become silly and juvenile. Chreiton's brain implant is becomming redundant and needs to be resolved. I do not plan on purchasing any additional episodes (perhaps even watching) unless they get new writers (someone over the age of 12 at least)for the upcoming episodes.LETS HOPE THEY RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL CONCEPTS OF THE SERIES."
1,Awful! Non-stick surface coming off already.,"In spite of not using the dishwasher, this product is falling to bits. It was a gift for my daughter's 18th birthday and she's only been using it since April. Avoid!!!"
1,Nothing to see here,I barely made it through half of the book. That was plenty enough to see he had little to offer beyond inventive self-congratulation.
2,Amazing,A must have compilation for all of us boomers and anyone who loves the 70's genre! FUN!!!!!!!!!
2,Bluesman,"A true bluesman, gentleman and friend. He has a very unique voice and is also a great guitarist. Highly recommend!"
2,"A Quality, Simple Upgrade","I have had this installed on my 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 4x4 for 3 years now. I thought I had reviewed it here but I guess not. Anyhew. . .You don't realize how restrictive the factory air intake is until you install this one. Installation was simple with good instructions for a non-mechanic like me. Throttle response was much quicker after installation. It did not do anything for gas mileage. I have yet to clean the air filter and instructions say don't do it anyway. I could detect little if any increase in noise, but then I have a flowmaster exhaust so that could be one reason. It did make the exhaust sound a little more ""throaty"" which is nice :-)I would definately buy again. It is an install and forget product with little maintenance required and improvement in performance."
2,Big five stars,"I have to say, I really liked Bella's character. I know some people blame her for being too head over heels in love with Edward and being shallow for focusing so much on his looks. Still, I think she was an interesting character, and I found her very brave and self-sacrificing."
1,Do not purchase without a store warranty,"This is my 2nd Tivo and I DO NOT recommend buying the Humax Tivo DVR. This recorder is a piece of junk. I made a huge mistake purchasing this directly from TIVO. I should have purchased it from Best Buy and spent the extra money for the replacement plan.The recorder pauses on its own several times a minute and is very annoying. It started doing this only after a couple of weeks.The picture quality is not good at all. I have 34"" Sony flat screen and have purchased the most expensive cables but this did not help.Customer service is horrible. I am a huge TIVO fan but I do not recommend the Humax Tivo DVD recorder at all."
1,What's The Hype All About?,"I found this book to be dull and tedious. Really over-hyped, as most books are. The characters are not really developed enough to make us care what happened to them, and the plot is extremely thin. As such, it is way too long and I found I had to force myself to finish. I had to read it several times to make sure I caught everything. Frazier is a novice writer and it shows. His style needs a lot of work, to say the least. Reading ""Ada said,"" and ""Ruby said,"" tacked on to the end of every sentence was irritating. For all those who think this is ""literature,"" try Umberto Eco's, ""The Name of the Rose."""
2,it is awesome...,"I have never had any formal exercise regimen before (nor done any reviews)but feel compelled to write this review. have had it for a week, i do feel the sculpting going on...as chalene says..it is what you put into it that makes the difference...so if you put more effort, you will definitely see the results"
2,Great markers!,"I love these wet erase markers. I use them for my re-usable calender on the fridge, I didn't like having to use rubbing alcohol to remove the dry erase markings. All the colors worked and are bright."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Day 1 - Stairs on slide deflate, 3-inch holeDay 2 - entire slide deflates NUMEROUS small holesKeep in mind only three children used this piece of garbage. 3 girls the heaviest at 90 lbs. SAVE YOUR MONEY THE COMPANY (intex) NOR AMAZON CARE ONCE THEY HAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Configurator inaccurate,The website configurator said that these blames would fit my vehicle. They were way too narrow.I can't comment on the refill's quality. But I am giving one star because of my wasted time.
2,Just what I expected,"It's so light that you hardly notice it hanging on your neck. At first, I had a hard time getting focused, but one I read the instructions, the two-step focus process worked like a charm. Excellent clarity. I wish I could have a wider view, but I know these are not designed for that."
2,Black Beauty,I sent this as a gift to my grandchildren the Toyko so I really can't evaluate it. The service was good. The product came quickly and was in very good shape.
2,Delicious mystery: done with style!!!! Unplug the phone!!!!!,"I love mysteries that do not seem like a Murder She Wrote episode. The murder of the nanny of a top fashion magazine editor begins this novel. The main character, Baily, is enlisted to help the editor, Cat, solve the crime so as to be one step ahead of the police. You will love running after Baily in her Manolo Blahniks to solve the Nanny Mystery!! Read it in one night because I couldn't put it down!!!!"
1,Strike Two,"Beware of these binoculars, I have had the same experience that G. Roche had on page 2. The first pair came and were out of collimation so I filled out an RMA request form and sent them back. They sent me a second pair and it was worse than the first. You would think they would at least inspect them for that problem before they send the second pair out...right? Not to mention the cost of freight. So here I sit with a second pair of binoculars that don't work and if I do send them back and pay the freight again, I will for sure get back another pair with the same problem. I could have spent the same amount of money once you include the freight twice and gotten a better pair of binoculars. I will tell you this, I am NOT buying another pair over the internet. I will go to the store and try them out before I purchase again."
1,"No comparison to other great songwriters, ie Ryan Adams","I bought both of these albums after all of the hype surrounding them and I am thoroughly disappointed with both efforts. He continuously sounds off key, his song structure is an unpleasant listening experience and he is overly hyped as a new Dylan when in fact, he doesn't even compare to Ryan Adams or other great, young musicians in this category. Pick up any Ryan Adams cd (or Whiskeytown) and you'll know what I mean, just no comparison. Both of these cd's weren't worth my money or time."
2,Love Their Style,"From the very first song, this album keeps you on your feet! Salvador's ""So Natural"" was the perfect addition to my collection. The songs were fun and funky, all while praising God. This head-bobbing, toe-tapping cd won't disappoint!"
1,The noise that will keep you away from watching this movie!,"I just saw this movie on TV at night. This movie doesn't make any real sense. Any smart person with half of a brain would just move out of that apartment from that noise and wacky neighbor. Also most girls in real life wouldn't go home with some random weird looking guy she meets in a seedy bar after giving bad ""come on"" lines and have sex with him at his place! The bar scene doesn't really work in modern times. But then she was drunk and traumatized after seeing her wacky neighbor half dead in a pool of blood. After all that, what her wacky neighbor really wanted was to make the main female character her personal assisstant at her company. Later on she becomes like her wacky neighbor after killing her. How ironic! The circle comes complete."
1,"Dear Diary, What a waste of time I committed ...","...when I read this trite, silly, pointless novel written by a guy who apparently thinks he knows how women think. As usual, however, when his female characters think, they think about some guy and how wonderful he is and how they live to make him happy and he should live to make her happy on and on and on ...I haven't read anything this overwraught and predictable since I stopped reading short stories ... The woman is always rich and beautiful and tragically wounded. The man, also rich and beautiful and tragically wounded, acts upon his grief or anger by doing something hurtful to the woman who loves him. Then the story is some pablum about how she either finds happiness with another man or he comes to his senses and woos her back....If I could give this book 0 stars, I would. ..."
2,Anna Maxted's best novel yet.,"Being Committed: A Novel by chick-lit goddess, Anna Maxted is her most intriguing and engrossing book to date. I love the wacky and unpredictable relationship between Hannah and her ex-husband Jack. This book was so fun to read about two summers ago. This is the book I always go back to every now and then. I love, love, love it and so will you. I highly recommend checking this romantic novel out."
1,"ok, but overrated as far as photographic advice is concerned","The book is ok and gives some really useful advice as far as (unusal) walks and detours are concerned. As far as adivce for photographers is concerned, the book is, however, not really good. you can find much more information online, e.g. be reading traveler reports or checking on tripadvisor."
1,boring,people say that plains trains and automobiles is so funny people I agree with usauly touht it was so so funny but I thouht it was very bad and very boring but I think john candy and steve martin are very funny just not in this movie
1,"Well... judging from the picture,...","I'm a little bit concerned about customer service, among other things, judging from picture displayed of this item. If that's a boat, then I'm a toaster oven. I'm also concerned about the folowing specification:Product dimensionms- 5 lbs.Last time I checked, dimensions were given in units of length and width and height.I'm shopping for a RIB in this price range, but I think I'll give this one a miss."
1,not what I was looking for,i was looking for some how to draw books with more illustrations .. I did try to read some of it but it just didn't catch my attention.
2,Need more items,To use this unit as a charging station you need to buy a power pack. It was not stated in the ad. Once I brought a power pack and pluged it up the unit did the charging. As a Data Transfer unit it does work the way it should.This is a good unit. I love it.
1,SO DISAPPOINTED,"You know, I am not one to rate something low and I already have Badger products that I love, but THIS product came BROKEN in THREE ways. The velcro on the doors are stapled, fine. The other piece, the one that attaches to the door--glued and floating around, so not really glued. There are two places where the nails are completely stripped....just slide right in. Great. And, the topper, the piece where the velcro is supposed to be attached to has three prescrewed sections and glue--but mine, not even attached. So, my options are to rig it or return it. UGH. It is cute, I must say. BUT, the staples on the cloth even look pretty shotty. Not sure that this will look good for long. I am just very disappointed. UGH"
2,4 1/2 stars,"From the beginning when reliving Marias death, to the end, when you know more is to come, Patterson keeps the reader riveted. With 'The Butcher', Patterson has added, what seems to me, the most violent thriller yet to the Cross series. Highly readable and quick to finish. An overall satisfactory entry to this series.Highly recommended."
2,your bound to learn SOMETHING about horses.,"I love the saddle club i have so many of their books but, this book was good with Lisa getting stranded, on tiny a huge horse, while she's missing a class, Veronicas still evil, but still a very interesting horse book for horse lovers."
2,Awesome Collection of heartfelt music,"This is an awesome album. It has many beautiful lyrics. It is an album of love. It is good to hear that Cave is in a good place. If you are fans of love songs, pick this up. It is a new chapter in this great artist's career. You should go listen to it, then you will buy it.Some real standouts are ALL OF THEM!"
2,Perfect shape,VHS arrived protected and in original celophane wrap. It was high quality. I'd buy from this guy again without hesitation.
1,Not good,"I wasn't really impressed with this book. It was so dull that I stopped reading after page 20. Furthermore, adultery is wrong. No matter how we like to romanticize it these days."
1,Disappointing,"I have had no real problems with my B40 coffee maker until I made the mistake of following the cleaning instructions stamped into the plastic beneath the lid of the water reservoir. The instructions read: ""To Clean Lid: Wipe With Damp Cloth, To Clean Reservoir: Dishwasher Safe"". After a run through the dishwasher the reservoir is completely warped, melted, and useless. For the price Keurig asks for their products they should be much more aware of what the instructions, they permenently adhere to the product, will actually do. I would not have run a plastic product through the dishwasher if it did not explicitly say that was the proper method."
1,Stop working after three months,"I purchased this navigation system based on all the great reviews. It arrived in perfect condition. Unfortunately, after using it about 6 times in 3 months, the unit suddenly stop working -- When it was turned on, the GPS just go frozen at the loading screen, stopped at 10% of the loading bar and won't go on.I contacted Nextar via their 1-888 number, and the only thing to do was return it for repair. SO I had to spend money to send the unit into Nextar for repair, and they said that the estimated repair time will take approximately 6 weeks after they receive it.Maybe you can think about it - IF* you don't mind to take the risk of lost your direction in the middle of trip* you are willing to take the trouble of returning and waiting* you can drive without a GPS for about two months(or more - who knows)."
2,"good quality, low price","Used every day for the past few months with no significant problems. Large enough to fit HP laptop with 17.3"" screen. Various pockets with reasonable amount of extra storage space. Seems very durable, no issues with plastic strap attachments as some other buyers had noted. One small issue- the inside strap does not velcro securely enough to keep computer from falling out, in the event that case is not zipped up completely. I'd say this case serves its purpose well and seems very inexpensive compared to similar products."
2,"Good bag, Few Pockets",This is a good backpack and I've been pretty happy with it. Though be sure you realize it doesn't have any outside pockets except for the main detachable one on the back.
2,Canon CB-5L Battery Charger,"It was unclear at first how to slip the battery in to the charger, however, once I did it charged the battery very well."
2,Easy way to save good wine!,"How many times have you wanted to open a good bottle of wine and only have a glass, but don't because you worry that the rest will go to waste. This wine saver is easy to use and keeps the wine tasting as good as the day you opened it. I love that it clicks to tell you when the vacumn has been achieved. Great for singles or couples who want to each have their own type of wine."
1,poor,"Package arrived no box, no bubble wrap, smashed ends in fair condiction and a piece of plastic that was covering the roll of mesh."
2,"Murder, She Wrote Season Five",I continue to be very happy watching this series and will add to my collection as I can.
1,This book is a perfect example of word processed trash.,"Honour Amoung Thieves is such a poorly written piece of word processed trash I was driven to finish it with the same impetus that drives one to pick a painful scab or tounge a sore tooth. The plot is as ridiculous, contrived and full of holes as a 1930's movie serial yet completely lacking in charm, humour or grace. The characters are simple racial stereotypes strung together like cheap plastic beads on the frayed dental floss of the storyline. There are crafty, evil Arabs, an Irish drunk, gravel voiced Mafia dons, and resourceful, dedicated Israelis. The book is so poorly thought out it gives the impression of being poured out onto a computer screen with one take and barely enough time for a spell check. Archer must have had a past due child support payment and where was the editor"
1,Opera: A Concise History (World of Art),"I want to cancel this book and sent e mail three times, but I never got reply. And I didn't get the book so far.(I ordered about 2 months ago)"
1,Ruined too many meals,"It seemed to work fine for about a year. Then about 5 meals in a row were way overcooked. Particularly bad with beef meals. Turned a nice piece of steak into rubber. We were wondering for a while if it was the recipe, the steak or what. Finally I found that it simply runs too hot Even on the low setting the food boils in the pot.We must have thrown out $75 worth of food before we caught on. Pay up for a better brand."
2,Great product and great price!,"This is a great fat loss monitor! Very easy to use. Some programming at the beginning but that is very easy, the only programming changes that need to be done after the intial programming are changes in weight and age. I let my friend use this also. My friend and I find this to be very acurate. The first few uses we would get numerous readings, the numbers did not change. Can't go wrong with the price! Well worth the purchase!"
1,Discolored,"My niece was looking forward to these boots so much for her birthday, and was dismayed (to say the least) when they had a yellow color to them instead of being white or off-white as in the product picture. I do not know if it's something to do with the way someone stored this item, but I would be very careful in retaining your receipt if you purchase these boots. I think they are really cute, and I know someone else that has them and LOVES them (and they're not discolored), so I hope no one runs into this problem!"
2,Never a problem in years of rough use,"We've had this poundy bench for about two years and through a lot of rough use, we've never had a problem with it. The holes have a rubberized ring inside that provide resistance to the pegs, which fit just fine. The wood is extremely durable (although now pockmarked by the hammer, which is a testament to the quality). The hammer has never come apart, split or otherwise been damaged.This is the best poundy bench I saw when shopping for them in person and I'm glad I bought a durable, solid wood bench."
1,Kroemer Should Remove His Name From the Book,"I'll start on a good note: The choice and order of topics has potential. The introductory example of cars in a parking lot was interesting, building stat mech from its core in probability into a very physical science.That said, anybody can write a good outline. It's just too bad that Kittel can't write a good book. This book is exactly like Kittel's book on solid-state physics: Drier than lunar soil. Lots of equation manipulation, and very little discussion or insight. I much prefer McQuarrie's book on stat mech.The most confusing thing about the book, however, is not the actual text but the fact that Kroemer's name even appears on it. Look at his quantum mechanics textbook: thorough, clear, and insightful. The complete opposite of this book...."
1,another cookbook disappointment,"I was very, very excited to get this cookbook. I am not a vegetarian, but do try to eat vegetarian whenever possible. As a result, I was looking for a good cookbook to increase my options. Many of these recipes are very time consuming and not necessarily worth the time put into them. A lot of the ingredients are also difficult for me to get at my local supermarket. I am still looking for a good, solid vegetarian cookbook."
1,A remake is a remake.,"First off, F word David Fincher. He sold his soul the day he put out the pandering ""Social Network"". Secondly, say all that you will, the film here is a remake of an adaptation. More money dumped into a garbage can does not change the garbage can into something other than a garbage can. Now, I like Daniel Craig. I do. He's cool. But as for the other actors, I don't really know of them. I'm sure they're cool, too. But I refuse to take exception everytime a bunch of people rave about something being good. I'll not watch this, and have no interest in changing my perception towards the original movie(s). I bet if advertised and angled right, chugging bleach would get consumers all lathered up to try. There. I actually feel better having said what was on my mind.By the way, take every last bit of this with a grain of salt. Watch the movie or don't whatever. I just had a burning need to express my opinion. It happens."
1,Junk,"Plugs into my iPad just fine, but neither of the 2 jacks will accept my headphones jack -- even with an abnormal amount of pressure. I didn't want to really force it in because I wasn't sure I'd ever be able to unplug my headphones."
1,It's a bound PDF.,"The following should not be taken as a knock against Deadlands or the quality of the game itself. Deadlands is a great RPG, lots of fun, and the content of the books is wonderful.But, the book Amazon will sell you is a bound PDF (the other reviews must be from fans of the RPG who did not buy it from Amazon, or bought it when the book was still in print). This is, to the best of my knowledge, the same thing you'd get if you bought it from the game's publisher, Pinnacle. IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL HARDCOVER. This version has pixelated images, a soft cover, low quality paper, and no color.So, if you just want the game, this is perfectly fine, but if you want the original printing, look elsewhere."
2,I Love it! Best Picture I have owned. Had HD before.,Features are easy simple and the picture and surround sound is a wonder. I bought it at Brands Mart including a 5 yr Warrenty in home and if it can not be repaired in a day in home Brands Mart replaces it with the same or an updated unit. The warrenty was $118.00.
1,OOPs!,"Was so excited to receive this cd, but must have received a defective one. The first two selections were not on the cd at all. Am anxiously awaiting a replacement CD and hoping it contains all selections"
1,This blows!,"I installed this to my VW Jetta and it was whistling at high RPM. I can hear the TXV whistle from inside the car so my AC does not cool. I had to pay an AC mechanic to replace it with a real TXV, which fixed my problem. For DIY'ers, look elsewhere as it will cost you money to replace this."
2,XBox 360 Remote Control,"Does what its supposed to do. We got it to make watching Netflix instant movies on the XBox more convenient. The remote gives you better ""pause"", ""stop"" and""play"" control than with the game controller. Well worth the $20. Only drawback: You have to aim the remote DIRECTLY at the XBox for it to work... if you are even slightly off it does not work. All in all, we are glad we got it."
2,"Fast-Paced, Entertaining, Gripping","This one is Frazer at her finest. Why paperback, though? I would think her sales would assure her a hardcover! Anyway, once again, she manages to wend her way through a complex mystery, and neatly draws the threads together at the end. Believable time-piece."
2,Graet Product,This processor really makes short work out of canning. Ingredients for salsas are a breeze. I should have gotten one sooner.
1,Shortsighted and not worth the anecdotes,"This account of the infamous Weimar Republic inflation of the 1920s are filled with details that are not well tied together. Instead of repeating the same over and again with variations, the author should have included tables and graphs that would be much more telling. This book doesn't explain much of the fundamental role of foreign and international policies and capital movements in this historic event. Overall, it is spiritless, limited to very superficial accounts and reporting, and boringly written.I would not recommend."
1,Thing is a piece,"when it got to me, only one side worked, about 3 weeks later other side didn't work, not worth the money asked at all This thing is a piece of S***"
1,Broke 1st day,"Let me start off by saying my dog is around 45 pounds and tears up normal toys very easily. This one appeared to be very durable, however it tore up within the first few minutes of my dog playing with it. I thought it would be great to hide treats it, but several of the tubes broke, so now nothing will stay inside it."
2,"Fulton County Blues: A Mystery Featuring Sunny Childs, P.I","Great. She's a likable character, and the situations that she gets into are just amazing. A great character. This conpletes my review."
1,"Not clever, just tedious","Dip into this book anywhere. Skip ten pages or 110. Read the whole thing or just read the first installment over and over and over again. It won't make the slightest bit of difference. For all it's supposedly clever feints, I found this book a grinding test of patience. Once you read the frist chapter, you've about got it. Characters, plot, and style are all thin to the point of banal, and the whole somehow manages to be even less than the sum of these thin ingredients. Among the other chores the reader must accomplish to reach the finish is to join in the narrator's conceit that his excessivly adolescent notes for a book would somehow interest a publisher, much less a reader."
1,Dont waste your time,Save your money if they are playing in concert in your town. Last summer they played at a benefit concert for kids with cancer and then played afterwards in town for half the cost. Just check out the local listings for a band called John Popper and friends....The music is dated so you dont want to pay full price to hear them play.
1,what a crock,"This is silly. Remember the old 'pet rocks' phase? At least that was meant to be a joke. IF you want hot rocks, dig some out of your yard and boil them in a pan--don't pad the pockets of some corporate monolith that invents ""needs"" just to increase their profits.Yeesh."
2,revisiting a classic,"Lucio Fulci is undoubtedly the king of Italian gore films. Always bloodier and more brutal than any of his peers (and that is a very esteemed group including such geniuses as Dario Argento and Mario Bava), Fulci never disappoints.The Beyond is his masterpiece, a terrifying journey into Hell itself. Featuring one of the finest actors in Italian film history, the late great David Warbeck.For those who have seen the film, this DVD edition is excellent in that it features lots of extras including running commentary from the two stars, a rare on-set interview with Fulci, numerous trailers, stills, and lots more. A true collector's dream.For those who haven't seen the film, this is the perfect way to be introduced to it. A true gore/horror classic - if you have not seen this film I urge you to do so now. You will not be disappointed!"
1,Not Rienzi,"The fact that Hitler liked this opera does not make it an opera about Hitler and the nazis or Mussolini and his fascists. This is a director's 'take' on the opera completely changing the motivation and actions of the principals. As such it is a travesty though well sung, played and acted. But never believe this is Wagner's Rienzi - you only have to read the libretto to see how falsely this version represents the drama.There is a wonderful and absolutely complete (not 9 hours) performance of the opera on cd conducted by Sir Edward Downes originally broadcast by the BBC in 1976 - well worth seeking out."
1,It's a shame,"This book represents how far we've dropped visually as a culture. Especially when there exists books out there, self published, like David Robbins ""Himalayan Odyssey"" that capture true insight into the Tibetan culture over a long, rigourous time and method. Instead, we're once again merely given more of the same pretty landscapes and fuzzy warm children that any passing tourist with a good working knowledge of their camera could do. Art is (was?) a wonderful person, I'm sure, though a mediocre photographer at best. Check out David's book for the real deal. I am a published photographer myself, albeit in a totally different genre."
2,Excellent DVD!,"The transfer is fantastic! Not to mention the movie itself which, as all H G Lewis fans know, is utterly depraved and fantastic! This is definitely not to miss. The commentary is great, with David Friedman (think that's how it's spelled) and good ol' Hersch himself! Very informative, you can actually learn some things from these masters of shlock. The DVD is great, the movie is better. Great music!"
2,Just an OK book - not very realistic,"Kate Reddy is not your typical working mother. She has a glamorous job (she admits she may go abroad three times a month) and has a minicab to pick her up to work instead of taking the Underground. She doesn't get treated as well as she likes, but she is very successful and well respected by most at her work place. She has a full time, live in nanny and enough money to hire whatever needs to be done. Because she is so lucky, I found her whining to be a lttle unrealistic and the sporadic illustrations of the difficult time women have in the of world of work to be a little sanctimonious. I was also disappointed to see her reject the man's world. I fully expected Kate to end up running her firm instead of leaving it because a woman with a family could never truly succeed in the environment. Nevertheless, this was a fun book to read, if only for the use of British terms."
2,Superb,"The late Sonny Sharrock's final album is an amazing work. Sharrock's first employer Pharoah Sanders and Coltrane drummer Elvin Jones place this album firmly in the tradition of the later Coltrane sound. Sharrock's compositions are accessible, yet sufficiently open for deep improvisation. Bill Laswell's production effectively captures Sharrock's (and Jones') HUGE sound, which could make most jazz producers faint. And unlike other Laswell-produced Sharrock albums, this one is pure jazz, without the heavy metal bombast or avante-garde remoteness of his other work.Few modern jazz albums succeed so well in that combination of depth and accessibility that make for the finest jazz. A worthy addition to any collection."
2,Jungle antics in two languages,"Mischievous mice, crazy cats, and other audacious animals traipse through the Happy Jungle and fill it with laughter and wisdom. Bilingual adventures in Spanish and English you won't soon forget. Great for children of all ages!"
1,So so aweful,This movie was dry and boring. It had very little story line and I had even less interest. That's sad because I enjoy Kevin Spacey's work and I enjoyed the music of the man as well. I shut the movie off after about 45 minutes of boredom.
1,Pass this up,"I did a test between O'Keeffe's cream and Flexitol for a week, and Flexitol won. I walked around barefoot for a week and put the cream on right before bed. By next morning, my heel with Flexitol was completely healed and healthy looking. The heel with the O'K'eeffe's was not. There was an improvement, but only slight. Overall, it's okay and it does work, which is why I gave it 2 stars. So if you use this, be patient because you'll be waiting several days before you see full results. Also be aware that it looks/feels like Crisco."
2,A Winner not a Whiner,"Sure this isn't ""You've got Mail"", or Star Wars, but it was not intended to be other that what it is, a good, not great film. There is lots going on here, but the best thing happening is the entertainment. There are guys to cheer, guys to dislike, and a beautiful woman who should have ended up with Hanks, but doesn't because she's normal and this isn't a hokey ending. So just enjoy, don't look for more than what was intended."
1,Not happy!!!,Boots are warm! But only have warn these boots for a shot tome and there shot already both the soles are craked where my feet bend not happy wish I could have my money back!!!!!
2,"Simple, easy, bomb-proof","I don't normally tie down the bow and stern of my kayak for the short trip through town to the local river, but on long interstate drives, it is a common sense thing to do. These little ratchets work easily and quickly and give you the peace of mind you need at 70mph. Highly recommended."
2,Good suspense movie,I had seen this movie prior to purchasing. It is has good suspense and mystery until the very end. Acting is believable and the actors are attractive to watch. The reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because some scenes are very violent. The violence contributes to the story but it just a lot. I bought this DVD as a gift for a co-worker.
2,Still a good Buy,When i firsted listened to it i put it away and didn't both with putting it on again untill i ripped it to a mp3 cd for the car and now that it has grown on me it has become one regular tunes for my ears. looiking at there other cd's it's still not the best but if you do like some of there Songs then it's still a good buy.
1,Very annoying router,"I bought this to replace a router of another brand that died after 2 years. This was a hassle to set up, requiring that I search out an alternate method of set-up by searching through multiple pages on cisco's website since the accompanying disk did not have the proper support for my system. If I weren't capable of following instructions, I would have given up after popping the installation CDROM in my computer. Now, every now and then the router and the cable modem don't get along and even when the cable modem is on correctly, I have to reset both to get my computer to recognize that I have more than a local network connection. Goofy stuff like that only happened previously when I had a power outage. Now I can walk away from my computer and find this scenario at least 3 times a week. I have to move in the near future and really have no problem tossing this router and getting a more user friendly version."
1,Sucked.,"Maybe I didn't get it. I thought the book was juvenile, the characters one-dimensional, and the plot didn't grab me. Well below Greg Bear at his best"
2,Truly a Bible,"I really love this book, it helped me out sooooo much and it had the cutest children mitten pattern. My sons love their mittens and I was so happy to be able to make them."
2,A Secret Love,I recommended to anyone who hasn't read Stephanie Laurens work. She is a great author and you won't be disappointed.
2,Best book on the ME I have ever read,"Even though it dates from the late 1980's, DPJ's ""The Closed Circle"" is one of the finest books on the Middle East I have come across and is as valuable today as ever. Rather than giving a very dry and distant overview of this complex region, the author uses his own experiences and intimate knowledge of local customs and history to give us a startling view of the culture and logic of the Middle East in general, and the Arab world in particular. For a historical overview of the ME, I would recommend any one of Bernard Lewis's books, but to really get an understanding of how different, and yet predictable, Middle Eastern logic and values are, this is by far the best resource.Highly recommended."
1,Elura 65 not dependable,"I purchased my Elura 65 new, before there were many reviews and like many others have had repeat problems with the ""remove the cassette"" message. I've had to mail it back to Canon twice and they replaced the drum assembly each time. Now it's died again, with a video tape inside, and Canon wants another $145.00 to get it out. Why would I pour good money after bad? I'll have to write off the tape and just purchase a new a camera, but definitely not a Canon.When it worked, the camera worked great out of doors (as long as I didn't get the moisture error) and ok indoors."
1,Better choice available!,"The EuroJet falls apart and leaks. A far better product is the Whedon SW8C Double Swivel SuperSpray. The EuroJet seems to be a copy of the Whedon product. The Whedon changes from spray to stream much easier, swivels much easier, and doesn't fall apart (the end cap on the EuroJet falls out). Plus the Whedon is less money."
2,"A classic, groundbreaking feminist of color anthology!","This is such an important anthology of writings by radical women of color on the politics of race, gender, class and sexual orientation. Though it is more than two decades old, the essays and poetry are still ispirational and relevant. Indeed, I strongly feel that this is a book that every feminist should read. That said, I am utterly baffled by how difficult it is to obtain. Could it really be out of print? If so, I hope (hint, hint) that some progressive publishing company like AK Press, South End Press, or Seal re-prints it. I would hate to think of it disappearing into the dustbin of history."
2,great sno cone maker,This is a great item works good and is cute too. I didn't give it 5 starts b/c it doesn't come with the stuff to make the sno cones - lame.
1,Too many problems,"I have had to send back this coffee maker once as the clock did not work properly and the machine gurgled constantly, overflowed and generally made a mess. Received another machine back from Capresso after a hassle and a rude customer service rep. This one is having problems as well. For $180 dollars, Capresso should be making a much better product than this.The Krups we had lasted a long time and was of a better quality than this. Capresso does get kudos for making a machine that brews a superior cup of coffee but the fact that it does not work properly is enough to give it a very poor review.I would think long and hard before buying Capresso ever again."
2,This Wallander is wonderful.,"I am a huge Wallander fan, have read almost all of the books, and was thrilled with this series.Would have given five, rather than four, stars, but it is a bit pricey."
1,Pam's review,"At this point I do not have anything bad to say about the percolator I orded. I do however, have this to say about the shipping of my order. When this percolator was ordered, I paid to have 1 day delivery. One day later and the percolator has still not been shipped. I feel the I have been cheated out of a large shipping cost when your company does not follow thru with advertising."
2,A must read for anyone in the criminal justice field.,"I first read this book years ago, when it first was published. After working in the field of juvenile justice for many years, I am now in the position to teach new employees in the field how to understand the incarcerated youth we work with. Although not all the youth we work with are criminals (some are really victims of social circumstances), this book was extremely helpful in helping me to understand how some of the youth we work with think, and how and why they truly are different from ""ordinary"" people. In every chapter I read I recognized at least one of the young people I had worked with over the years. This book gives valuable insight into the criminal mind."
1,Piece of junk,"I just opened the package of my new mouse, inserted the batteries...and somehow, some tiny piece of the battery cover must have snapped off. Now it won't go back on. I might as well have flushed $25 down the toilet, as the thing is instantly unusable. I didn't even force the cover off, and certainly couldn't tell that something broke until I tried to put it back on. Save yourself the grief and purchase a different mouse."
2,ZERO disipointment for ZERO gravity humvee,"This thing is sick. I honestly thought this would be a cheap toywhen I saw it on TV,but geuss I was wrong. When we where geting in our parking lot from the Mancister HYATT about 2 days ago itwas sitting right on my front porch. We diden't pay for it oranithing,yet it was siting right there on my front porch. You now what, it was my friend he gave his own toy to me. Plus I gotit for free.And geuss what,I loved it!"
2,Easy to install,It does the job well. Now I have clear water coming out from my shower head. Totally happy about it!
2,Sit a spell.......and read this book!,"I became hooked on this author's books with the first one I bought (about the Munchkins), so it's no surprise that I love this one too! Once again, it's full of rare photographs, little known trivia and fascinating tid-bits. Even if you only had a passing interest in The Beverly Hillbillies, you're going to love this book. And if you're a fan of the show......you're going to be in Seventh Heaven with this one! You'll love this as much as Elly May Clampett loved her critters!!"
1,I don't want to grow up,"This poor man is unable to act as a mature man would, an has managed to blame it on God."
1,Are there no editors?,"While this short book is a pleasant enough companion for a long soak in the tub, it would have been greatly improved by some decent editing. Grammatical errors, repetition of anecdotes, and constant references to the authors' wealth abound. Since Michael Korda is editor-in-chief at Simon & Schuster, such lapses are appalling."
1,"A fun idea, but nothing more","Writers who are insightful and entertaining elsewhere, like Virginia Heffernan and Nick Hornsby, are dull and pointless here. Susan Cheever gives us yet another picture of her famous father as a stuffy suburban drunk. Nora Ephron likes Mary Tyler Moore because it made her feel better about being a single woman. So what? ""Why did you like Gilligan's Island"" is not an inherently interesting question- quite the opposite. It would take real talent to make something nourishing out of these bones. And, although the resumes of these writers indicated that the necessary talent had been assembled, the product demonstrated otherwise"
2,Powerful yet understated,"The songs on ""Is This Desire?"" are more minimalistic, more understated and less emotional than on ""To Bring You My Love,"" but no less powerful. The tracks ""Angelene"" and ""A Perfect Day Elise"" continue to haunt me long after I listen to them. The techno influence is present again, but is still fairly low-key."
2,Great price for 2 year Popular Mechanics,Purchased Popular Mechanics and locked the low price for 2 years compared to book store price. My daughter and I can read it. I paid the price on 5/4/2010 but have not received the first copy yet on 6/5/2010. I will update my review as soon as I receive it.
2,We all know Amy Lee is amazingly hot...but,"Okay so Amy Lee is beatiful, but if you look past that you will fing a really good album. With most of the [music] coming out of the hard rock/alternative area it's nice to have a women give new life to music that was starting to sound the same. I've heard friends say that all the songs sound the same, but if you actually listen to the album all the way through, you will realize they are all unique. Track four ""My Immortal"" is a good example of Amy using her talented voice with a soft piano in the back ground.I highly recommend this album, and hope that Evanescence stays around for a long time, and shows us all how to rock!!Oh Amy, you rock my world!!"
1,Had lots of potential,"This movie had all kinds of creative sci-fi ideas in it, and ultimately, that is what caused the movie to fail. There was just so many competing ideas mishmashed into there together - this weird vampire dream, pocket dimensional technology, viruses, etc etc. If a more coherent/unified story had been wrought, this movie would have been a lot more."
2,Wow,"As I searched for words to describe this book, I soon realized that my search was completely and utterly hopeless. I have always considered myself a reader, but once I read this book, I saw how incredibly illiterate I am. It is very refreshing to have found one of those rare stories in a genre full of junk that is actually significant and stands out. Anyone who has ever fallen for the mysterious guy is morally obligated to read this book. It's like I was sucked into a black hole that spit me out in the middle of Forks, Washington where I witnessed Isabella and Edward's entire struggle. I tip my hat to Stephenie Meyer for this fabulous change of pace in the teen genre. You're not going to find any amount of adventure this intense in any other book for a very long time. This book is flawless."
1,Not great,"This product seems like it might be OK for loosely clogged pores, but for deeper blackheads, or for large pores, it doesn't work at all. I have drier skin, so maybe that's the problem, but we tried it on my boyfriend and absolutely nothing budged. I have tried it about 6 times over the last two weeks, and the only time anything was ever extracted from my pores was right where my nose meets my cheek, and I was excited to see some gunk actually get sucked out. However, the next day, that area was completely bruised and dark red with blood under the skin. Another effort yielded two circular bruises - one on my nose and another on my chin. So while I believe this might work for some people, I'm not sure it won't damage your skin. I'm unfortunately sending mine back since it causes bruising, which doesn't seem appropriate for this type of appliance."
1,Not for me,"Don't care for the story line.Too, distasteful and hardly worth reading even if it was the last book I had.."
2,Funny ...,It's funny! It will make you remember the last time u ... well read and you will understand. Thanks for sharing!
1,Pray ...you get another cd,"This was my first and last cd by Douglas Spotted Eagle. I'm sure he might be a nice guy, but this cd is new age snoozac. One or two good moments, technically good flute. But too much mysticism and even programed drums !Best wishes to Mr. Spotted Eagle for the future though."
1,seriously overpriced,"Toby Wilkinson, a well-respected young British Egyptologist, has gathered together all known published information about the Palermo Stone and 6 other associated fragments and added a little of his own. The resulting text is spread thinly over some 300 pages including 12 line-drawings.I was disappointed that such an expensive volume did not even have any photographs of the objects being described. At 20 this book would be reasonable value but at 150 it is an unnecessary extravagance. I'm glad that I borrowed a copy from the British Library rather than buying it.In contrast, Toby Wilkinson's ""Early Dynastic Egypt"" is a valuable and not outrageously priced work that should be on the shelves of every Egyptologist with interests in that period."
1,Freezes when playing audio cds,"Everything else seems to work ok. Had the same buggy stupid problems with HDMI cables like everyone else at first, but thanks to reviews and research I quickly fixed that problem.My major problem and I'm going to try and take it back to the big box retailer, is that it periodically freezes up when playing audio cds; it doesn't matter if they're retail or cdr or burned on a dvd-rw, for not reason, it freezes. I found if I hit ""setup"" menu button quickly two times it goes on playing.It's like it just pauses for no reason.Usually about 2 minutes into the first song, and then who knows how many times thereafter.I suspect a moisture/heat-cool problem but not too sure about that. It's too sensitive.Also, I think the laser is underpowered or something becuase if any CDRW or DVRDW has any scratches on it, it has a hard time handling them.My Philips DVP642 never had any of these problems and I wish I hadn't sold it."
1,Not as advertised,"First off, reviews should be for the item NOT the seller. That's what the resolution center is for.Second: yes, there are 3 movies here, but half is on ONE disk and half is on the 2nd disk! NOT ONE MOVIE PER DISK! That is why I got it. To give a copy to family members w/children. VERY disappointed."
1,No real info,"You'll learn more about the author's ""pet peeves"" than you will about Analog Synthesis. I read it twice thinking may be a missed something the first time. Perhaps if you take the subtitle ""A Newbie Guide..."" VERY literally it might be OK, but this book offers less info than than most Synth manuals (and that's saying something). Save your money and check out the Web there are several sites that provide way more info than this book does."
2,Larry Legeng is the greatest of all time,"This video just goes to show that Larry Bird is indeed the greatest basketball player of all time. His uncanny ability to dominate a game without even shooting the ball, or scoring 50 points, or registering one of his many triple-doubles to help the Celtics win. He could raise the level of the players around him. He wasn't blessed with great athletic ability, but made the most with what he had by his sheer determination. His overcoming so many stikes against him to succeed should encourage anyone. Michael Jordan might have scored a lot of points, but Bird was the greatest all around player. He averaged 25 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists over his 13 year career. This video is a must have for any Celtics/Bird fan."
1,doesn't work with all mp3 players,This stuff claims to work with all mp3 players but it doesn't. Recently I bought it for my Samsung mp3 player and found that it takes only 2.5 mm audio jack. The J buds are 3.5mm and hence didn't fit. Promptly returned the stuff and got refund from amazon.
2,gruesomely entertaining!,"I stumbled upon this book when I was in England in 1996. I wasn't reading for pleasure much, but I couldn't put this book down. The story is so good, I think it's the only book I've gone back to time and again.Supposedly there is going to be a movie done by Ewan Mcgregor's movie company.I would love to see that. I can't help but imagine how cool it would be done with a soundtrack of My bloody Valentine type music.Grab this book if you see it. It's well worth a quick entertaining read."
1,"Great Movie, but this VHS Tape is Awful","After years of trying to get a copy of this wonderful movie and checking on Amazon, suddenly it became available on VHS at Amazon last summer and I ordered a copy. What arrived, is NOT an original studio release. Instead it was a generic tape with a typed white label. When I put it in to view, what I found was a very grainy image with a dubbed English soundtrack. I was very disappointed.My guess is that someone found a copy of the 1972 poor U.S. release at a flea market somewhere and has taken a position that the copyright has entered the public domain after 28 years as per statutory section 17 USC 303 of the copyright law and is publishing copies of that worn out flea market copy."
2,Awesome,the cyclone feeder system is awesome my alpha black 98 custom came in today i installed it in like 5 minutes this is an amazing addition and i cant wait to start shooting my marker.
1,terrible. buy something else!!!!!!!,Can't get rid of bubbles! It won't stick to the right edge of screen at all. Impossible to install and I've installed many! Very gritty looming screen when it is on and finger drags. There is nothing good about this screen protector. All this and it is over priced!!!! Buy anything else!!!!
2,Joey Pearson Rules!,"I just gotta say, like Joey rules! This CD rocks! I love his singing! Not only can he sing, he's CUTE! I recommend his CD for anyone who loves AWESOME singing and GREAT songs! I hafta say, the one song that made my mom cry was Candle Light The Way, even my dad got emotional. It's hard to chose a fav..they are all good!I hope to see more of you Joey Pearson!!! I know you're gonna be a big star!love,Angie"
2,Flawless,"This unit has worked flawlessly for the 3 years we have had it. The feature I like most is having project files created on one networked computer be backed up not only to the Mirra but also to other networked computers. But here's the beauty, files edited on the other computers are automatically backed up to the Mirra, and minutes later to the originating computer. I imagine that the same file could be edited by two people at the same time, but I haven't had this problem so far. The real solution to this is of course a more expensive regular server, but for our small business this works perfectly fine. I believe this unit is obsolete now, Seagate indicated in 2008 that they would be retiring the web based service related to this product."
2,Frostbite <3,"I'm usually quite cautious when it comes to picking out nail polish colors but this winter I decided to go on a Blue trend. I wasn't sure what blue to pick but seeing the name "" Frostbite "" I decided to give it a try. Let me tell you something, this nail polish color is GORGEOUS! I recommend two-three coats to bring out the full color but wowwwwww! I never thought I'd fall in love with a blue nailpolish quite like this!! Now I'm looking for a color from China Glaze to act as an accent for this color. Absolutely recommend all the way!"
1,Should have kept White Zombie together,"The post-White Zombie gets off with a whimper. Overproduced to the point it is a bad parody of what White Zombie did well and way too techno for a guy who put together the best metal album of the 90's in La Sexorcisto. I tried to like it, truly, but after several spins of the CD it just wasn't very good. It starts off excellent with two very good songs but after that--very little of interest. Two stars one for each quality song."
1,VeRy misleading!!!!BeWArE,"Im a big big tales from the crypt fan, and when i saw this deal ''a big collection like that(13 tapes the pictures shown)''for only 26$....have to get it ......what a deception when you open the package and you get 3 tapes.....email mr amazon.com......that tells me i should read the description beacause it clearly say that you get 3 tapes......F%@# that .........i got rip off and if i want 25$ back....its cost me already 10$ of shipping and gonna cost me another 25$ to send it back......F@%* that S$!#....im gonna sell it on ebay and buy on ebay......EBAY EBAY EBAY!!!!!!! Im not happy customer and wont buy again from this site.....buy the way...it was my first time......BBAAAAAAADDDDDDD xperience!!!!!"
2,the amazing coupon organizer,"This is a great binder that has been seen on ""Extreme Couponing"" Show. This Case It D-400 binder has 3 rings that is spacious enough to buy baseball cards holders and insert all of your coupons in and have an organized approach to your journey to saving money. I have a few of these binders that i love for all my trips to Shoprite. My 15- year old daughter uses the CaseIt for her schooling, its nicer than any binder on the market. Do your research and then come back to amazon for the best deal on the CaseIt."
1,Same old same old,"Up to now all Amy Tan's novels have followed the same formula:(1) Mother fled to the US from China around 1949 when the communists took over.(2) Daughter raised in America hates Chinese culture and mom's superstitions.(3) Mother and daughter did not get along or understand one another.(4) Mother reveals all secrets left behind in China when nearing the end of her life.(5) Mother and daughter thus make up and daughter comes to appreciate her Chinese heritage.Reading one of those books is Okay, but two or more is just too much! Please! Show some fresh ideas here!Also for those of you who are fascinated but unfamiliar with China, do take it as a drama instead of could-be real life story. The book feels to me more like Chinese food in America - Americanized to be appealing to the general audience - If you want authentic taste, go read some original Chinese works and meet some real Chinese people!"
1,Entertaining Trash,"A very silly book. Interestingly, liberalism has been dead since 1980, and our political system is rotten with campaign pay-offs, revolving-door lobbyists, deserted factories, and corporations face down in the public trough...something like James Taggart's Washington! When Rand wrote this book, liberal politics made America the glory of the world. Now it's a sewer of blatant corruption. How could anyone be intellectually pliable enough to take Ms. Rand's lunatic rant seriously?"
2,DC's Finest,"I bought the CD a few days after it came out and I have to say that I really love this album. For those of you who like the harder, heavier songs, you won't be disappointed. But also on this album, the boys get melodic on some of their slower and more emotional songs. There's something here for everyone and I highly recommend it. Two thumbs way up, great family fun."
2,The little radio that good,Excellet little radio for the price. Replaced my 30 year old transitor radio like a charm and get me connected during power outage.
2,The Clue of the Black Keys,"Is it a good book? I say yes because once again Carolyn Keene manages to stump her readers. You start to wondering: where is doctor pit, what happened to the keys, and how will the atractive blond Nancy Drew solve the mystery? The only way you can find out is by reading The Clue of the Black Keys."
1,poopy game,"i'm sorry. this game is very poopy. it's a very poopy game. if you like poopy games, then you should buy this poopy game. because this is a poopy game. it's a very poopy game. do not get this poopy game unless you like poopy games like this poopy game. this is a very poopy game."
2,Seminal Pop/rock. A Pulp masterpiece,"One brilliant album from the blokes that brought you Different Class. Like their 1995 masterpiece, His 'n Hers draws its influence from culture clashes/social awareness and packed with those gorgeous J.Cocker melodies. The His 'n Hers theme and sound eventually evolved to the not so different 'Different Class'. I've listened to this album front to back and everything is MUSIC. Every song, I've found that there is something clever about it, some lyrical theme or crazy guitar work that catches my ear. My personal favorites areJoyriders,Acrylic Afternoons,She's A Lady,andPink Glove. And the keyboard melody near the end of track #11 is a bona vide lullaby. Regarding this LP - I think of Pulp as a very sophisticated and cultured music group, and J.Cocker as an enlightening lyrical figure. One of MY favorite albums; worth those petty bill$."
2,Insightful about power and domination,"This was a very academic book about women's rights, women's power and the thought process of power and domination. It was very insightful and helpful for me to understand my relationship with women."
2,Wonderful book about a very great man.,"This is a book that has been ignored by the media which does not want to hear about good Catholic clergy. The media only wants to know about scandal in the church - because the Catholic Church and that which it really stands for(as contrasted with the deedsof the fallible priests,and lay Catholics that can be found within it) is the mortal enemy to secular humanism, sexual license, abortion and the ""if it FEELS right, do it"" philosopy that is held so dear by much of the media.The book is a great inspiration because Bishop Sheen, with all his human failings, is an inspiration to us all."
2,Good Drummer Boy,This is one of the top 3 versions of The Little Drummer Boy I've found so far. arrived & played ok.
1,The feeder does not work.,"After only a few uses, the paper feeder stopped working, so now I have to manually feed each sheet at just the right moment or else start all over again. I would not buy this printer again."
1,if you have 3 hands,You have to hold down the button to keep the light on. Not easy when you need 2 hands to tweeze.....great trying to remove a splinter - or a stray brow hair....NOT
2,Cranford / Return to Cranford,Sometimes sequels are not as good as the original but that is not the case in this instance. We often choose the second one to look at when we are in the mood to see Cranford again. The characters are very good at portraying their parts.
2,Develop habits for highly successful introductions,The suggestions and areas of focus are presented in ways that make sense in most instances of introduction. The scenarios relate to many personal experiences and has made for good discussions with my friends
2,SW,"There's not to much to be said about The Elements of Style. It's a strongly written style and grammar guide that can be a bit outdated at times, but the writing's so strong you kinda wanna be outdated."
2,Tears and Revelation,"The first 2/3 of this book were intriguing and unique, although not entirely amazing. The last 1/3, however, was incredible. I had to pause now and then because of the tears in my eyes. The book was so meaningful and heartfelt without the effort."
1,I did love the cover!!!,"But that was the only thing about this book I liked. I do like time travels if they are done well. Lets just say this was not one of them. From what i could guess by other reviews this was a funny book - I think I read a different book than everyone else or I have no sense of humor.The characters bored me , the book was so blah, blah that I had to skim the pages just to get to the end. Please save your money."
2,An excellent adventure,"Alderson has helped bring to light a little known and critical natural area and along the way has discovered people and places that illuminate Florida's history and culture beyond the oft-visited tourist centers. Alderson shows you the real Florida and helps you experience the pull of the tides, the roll of manatees moving over the seagrasses, and foraging birds in a lingering subtropical sunset - as well as clouds of mosquitoes in your tent! A very rewarding adventure and satisfying read."
2,"The best book about the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, bar none.","The late Bernard Fall is without a doubt still the best historian and writer of the First IndoChina War (the French Indochina War). Ideally, this book should be read along with Fall's other great book ""Street Without Joy"". These two books will provide any student of the French IndoChina War with an in-depth knowledge of this period of history. They are an indispensble part of any serious students library."
2,Overall very fun game,"I find this game to be very fun to play. You use the DK bongo accessories to play from a selection popular and classic songs. Some of these songs have been modified a bit to make them easier to drum to. None of the songs with lyrics are done by the original artists. This is actually an improvement, in my opinion, for some of them like ""Rock Lobster"" by the B52s. There are three difficulty levels, which start out at the relatively easy ""monkey"" and progressively get more difficult with ""chimp"" and finally ""gorilla"", which is incredibly challenging."
2,Very nice pan...does not fit a toaster oven,"I purchased this for my toaster oven that is supposed to fit a 12"" pizza. I thought this pan would fit since it is labeled as 12"". But it did not fit.That by no means makes this pan useless. It is a very nice pan! I am going to buy the larger size too. It does not warp in the oven like some of the thinner cookie sheets. It is nice and heavy but not too heavy. If you make smaller recipes this is a nice little item to buy!"
2,AL Star Country Christmas,If you love Country Music. You'll love this CD.Seller did as promised and CD arrived as promised in great shape
1,Poor Quality,"I own 3 other Malibu Shores comforter sets and I just love it with no problem. But, with this particular set I'm so disappointed with the quality of the material is poor, the areas where two materials were sewn together is tearing apart, and the stitchings are coming apart in many different parts of the comforter. Not to mention the padding is already separating after two weeks of usage."
1,There is almost nothing new or accurate about this book.,"Beware! This is a very strange, and misleading book about the Little Big Horn Battle. The author utilizes already discredited accounts, changes others to suit his needs, takes no consideration of time and place for various events, and, it appears, constructs some events from whole cloth.If you really want to read about the Indian side of the story (and to understand that day, you must understand that side.)then read Lakota Noon."
2,"The Millionaire Maker: Act, Think, and Make Money the Way the Wealthy Do",MS Langmeier proofs that poverty belongs in the museums and that every person has the potential for a life of wealth. People like her rekindle hope in others.
2,Mostly Right,"The book is a great overview of the human body's natural diet. Dr. Cordain does a great job explaining in detail the concepts of a Paleolithic Diet and how it translates into modern day eating. I agreed with most of Dr. Cordain's concepts except when it came to eating fat. Fat, and more specifically saturated fat, has been unfairly villainized by modern paradigms and this book does nothing to clear this misinformation. There is some evidence to suggest that our ancestors preferentially ate the fat from the animals they hunted. Cordain's diet seems to skirt this issue and combine a true paleo diet with a modern day, politically correct, low fat diet."
1,Made of cheap corrugated colored cardboard that I could of done myself!,"I would give this negative stars if I could. I could of made this myself for less money. Once I saw how cheaply this gift box was constructed I quickly put it back in the box and returned it for a full refund. It is not at all how it is described or pictured. It is constructed of colored corrugated cardboard. There are dents, holes and glue marks everywhere. I am still in shock how much this cost me! It resembled something my child would of made for me in kindergarten as a project for Mother's Day. I have posted some REAL pictures under the product page so you can see for yourself."
1,Network Analysis and Troubleshooting?,"There might not be a lot of questions regarding network analysis and troubleshooting on the exam. If there is and you buy this e-Book, you might be disappointed.I am not studying for the exam but based on the title I felt that it might help with some basic analysis of IP traffic over a network. However there is little if any assistance on that process.I would more aptly consider this to be titled 'TCP/IP 101 for Dummies'."
2,Gauchito rocket,"The rocket kit is called the ""Gauchito"" .""Launchables""is the name of the packaging,with several rockets in the ""launchables"" linupLOL"
2,absolutely enchanting,"Francesca Lia Block is an example of a glorious author. Her work is completely captivating. Dangerous Angels, being several books combined inside one cover, has in itself a complete set of emotions. She has the ability to delve into your heart and force you to relate to the characters. Her writing is mystical and completely real in a wonderfuly unreal way. She writes beautifully and this book encaptures everything beautiful in life and expresses it in a way you can't understand but can feel. She expresses so much through her characters in a way that you can relate too. Everything she writes is so soulful and everyone should experience the passion of her writing"
1,Gave out after a year,"The warming plate ""lost steam"" after a year and failed to keep coffee warm. Disappointed b/c I liked the appearance but with the cost that I paid you would like to get more than a year of use."
1,Experienced Knitter/Crocheter,"I just purchased this book and I am very disappointed in the directions. I am in the middle of trying to crochet the top on the cover, and I feel like the directions/diagrams were written by someone who has never actually crocheted and was just guessing at the process. If you only look at the pretty pictures, you will be impressed. If you actually try to follow the directions, you won't be. I recommend any one of the Leisure Arts pamphlets sold on Amazon for crocheted tops instead."
2,Best penguin ever!,Our 9 months daughter loves it very much! The toy is very durable and the baby can suck it without any issues (eq. falling fur & etc.).When I was ordering it I did not expect the toy to be such high quality craft.I love it too! :-)
1,Its too fast,"I brought this clock considering the lengendary sony trademark. But it turned out to be a complete disappointment. Its gaining hours and I am about to return in today. Well,the display is not so bright. If you are looking for a good bedside alarm clock with radio, please don't go for this one."
2,"For the price, what's to complain about? Some chipped paint. That's about it.","these are little brackets that fit 1/4"" rode and hold it to the wall. LOTS of them were chipped paint, but where they are used it didn't matter to us. Comes with screws and anchors. For the price (about $5) it did the job."
2,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:One of the best movies Allen has ever made, Match Point is a fascinating character piece that changes almost imperceptibly into a first-rate thriller; a movie that can be viewed over and over, it's worth watching and owning."
1,This phone is terrible!,This phone is a piece of garbage. The most important aspect of a phone is its clarity during conversations. This phone has loud persistent static even when near the base station that makes conversing on it irritating and unenjoyable. All the other features on this phone are moot considering the terrible static. I will be smashing the phone to pieces once I get my new Panasonic 6.0 DECT.
2,Glad I have this book,"IF you don't have a problem with eggs, this is a great recipe book. I've made several of the muffin recipes and and a few of the loaves as well. I reall like the taste and texture and have recommended the book to several people. Whether the results are high or low carb depends on which recipe you choose, and you do have a choice for many of them of using the stevia-only versions. You don't have to use a recipe with cornmeal or cornstarch; they're in those particular recipes for a reason, but not in all of them. You can choose coconut milk, or any other non-dairy milk. I don't get why some reviewers make things so difficult for themselves. Can they use every recipe in every other cook book they buy? I'm not interested in every recipe in the book, but there are many more I have yet to try, and will. Of those I have made, the ingredients, except for the coconut flour itself, are all readily available."
2,Great Product,"I debated whether to get this model or the smaller model from Bodum. This larger model is really not that large and would probably work for 2 people who each enjoy more than one cup of coffee in the morning. It is well made and very functional. However, I would estimate that the coffee only stays warm for approx 30 minutes, maybe somewhat longer, not 2 hours."
2,Used 2 bottles throughout pregnancy,"have faithfully uesd this oil every night during pregnancy, pleasant smelling. it's quite oily so allow time for skin to absorb prior to dressing. though the development of stretch marks is largely genetics and weight gain during pregnancy, and as far as i've read cannot be really prevented by any cream, i still enjoyed using this to moisturize my skin every night during pregnancy."
1,Mediocre knock-off,"Product works fairly well, but not perfectly; sometimes takes a while to start/finish. Packaging is clearly not the actual One Touch can opener, but a third-party knock off; I can't recommend this at a price so close to the actual product. Works kind of OK though. You probably should keep looking, potential buyer."
1,Go for another brand,"Bottom line, these things sound horrible compared to other brands of IEMs (in ear monitors). I was completely unimpressed with the base and mid-range frequencies of these phones. I currently own 2 pairs of Shure phones and absolutely love them. Stay away from the Etymotics."
2,Review improper channels,"Excellent fun, movie that has aged very well, I enjoyed seeing it again. Recommend.Hopefully I have added a photo of the little girl all grown up!"
2,Satisfied,"As others have noted, the plastic clips holding the thing together are flimsy. However, the design of the product is ingenious. Works as advertised: 3 cats, much easier than any other method I've found."
2,Absolutely Amazing!,I made the Prime Rib with Vegetable Au Jus and Herbed Yorkshire Pudding for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day. This was an incredible dish. It delighted all of the senses and went well with the suggested wine. Buy this book!
1,Not as easy as she says it is!!,"I've made several dozen batches of cold-process soap over the last year. I was very excited to try the recipes and techniques in this book. Oy vey, what a production! I read the book three times cover-to-cover and was still thoroughly confused and intimidated.The book is badly organized and sometimes contradictory. Finally, in desperation, I decided to make the ""Translucent Liquid Soap"" recipe in Cavitch's Soapmaker's Comapanion. Blessedly simple by comparison, and after my first batch the Faillor techniques began to make a bit more sense. .The (Cavitch) recipe turned out nicely, and once I get a bit more practice, I will look forward to making Faillor's recipes, but take my word for it, a beginner would be thoroughly befuddled by this book."
2,Pretty good.,"This book was pretty awsome. It had some parts that seemed to drag on, but what book doesn't. It had some real suspence parts that you just couldn't put down. I like when Nancy and Ned were in the underground river thing, it was intense."
1,Pathetic,"Full of hysteria, paranoia, and lies. Very typical of the genre. I'd rate it down there with anything by ""Dr."" Rebecca Brown. A complete waste of money and an attempt to create a modern ""witchhunt"" era through propaganda."
2,Great movie,I really loved this movie! It's a movie that just makes you feel good. You can watch it over and over again. The movie was in great condition when received and the price was great.
2,xserve delight,"If you own a classic Xserve, this little card will brighten your day. Yes, you can use Apple's own software product, or even Timbuktu (which is a very nice program I might add). However, suppose you decide to install Linux. You're pretty much out of luck. It works right out of the box and it won't overtax your system bus. A great little card. Don't plan to game with it. That's not in the cards."
2,"Good, clean fun.","Well, not really, but two out of three ain't bad. Clean just isn't a word in Lil' Kim's vocabulary. Let me first say that I'm really not one for rap music. I have heard a few rap songs that I like a lot. ""I'm That Type of Guy"" by LL Cool J is one example. But typically I find it repetitive with not much going on musically, and nothing much more than posing going on lyrically. I was pleasantly surprised by this disc. There seems to have been a lot of care taken in doing something different musically. The raps themselves, well, some of them would make Larry Flynt blush and did me as well, but she's definitely good and comfortable with what she does. Personal favorites are ""How Many Licks?"", ""I'm Human"" and ""She Don't Love You"". If you like rap, you'll probably really get into this. If you don't, give it a try. You may be surprised."
1,Rude and lewd,"I just want better for my kids. This is the PG of the 80's--full of crass jokes (the kids joke about playboy, etc.) that would be pg13 today."
1,frustrating,"I followed the directions to a t. Unfortunately, my computer recognizes that there are files in the player, but the player doesn't. No file is what it reads, yet when plugged in to the computer, it plays my playlist. I then called the 800 number supplied by iClick. They took my name and number, they will ""get back to me"". I should have known, you get what you pay for."
2,Excellent,"This is truly worth every penny! Jeff Mangum writes his best work ever, every song is spectacular. Though the CD may take a few people a while to get used to because of the wierdness of the lyrics, and jeff's passion in his singing. But if you are already a NMH fan or an E6 faithful this album is a must, the best band E6 has to offer. Highlights of the CD are: the first song ""king of carrot flowers pt1"", the title track, and ""holand 1945"", the CD is a great mix with folk and indie rock and psychodelia."
1,Not the book I thought it would be,"In reading the title, I thought this would be a great book to help me with those Red Flags we all see in our relationships with our partner, but somehow believe we can over come due to our tremendous power to love. Yes, Virginia, for I to, Love & Do Too Much.When I opened this book, I was shocked to see concepts relating to: when faced with an unbearable action by loved one, go deeper. Show more love, give more! I personally can't give any more, do any more, be any more than I am or ever will be!!I was hoping to see some helpful hints liken to the title (You know, if this hurts you - it isn't love baby). Say, ""he's verbally abused you, yet again, in front of friends or tells you're stupid, worthless, etc."" - I'd think the correct response is A. Walk Away (right Chuck?)I've just ended (for good) a 5 year abusive relationship. I'm glad I did it before I saw this book.Chuck, Change the title - what a misnomer!"
1,Inaccurate and missleading,Working through this book on a skin care course was very frustrating. The medical terms used were inaccurate and often contradictory.Althought the basic skin care isues were dealt with efficiently the anatomy and physiology references were not consistent with current medical text books.This publisher has many better books. Avoid this one.
2,Great Shabby Chic Side Table!,"I love this side table, I put it on my front porch that has white wicker furniture and colorful floral pillows. The detail is very pretty and I put magazines on the bottom shelf and coasters, wine corkscrews and bottle openers in the drawer. This could be used in any room of the house, a great find for the price!"
1,problem,"I would love to write a review if the items had ever arrived which they haven't.I found the book in Paris. Captured by its famous opening sentence, I bought it. Then I became amazed at its tone-- whimsical humor and tragedy juxtaposed as they are in life. The gender identities of the narrator and his/her beloved were unclear with the narrator ruminating and examining religious beliefs as s/he traveled over the Middle East. Now if the books would only arrive, i could give another one to a friend and have one for myself.M. Acevedo"
2,Fantastic,"This movie was great! Definately one of my favorite Japanese animation movies! Wonderful storyline, and cute charecters. This movie talks about growing up, doing your part, making friends, and being a witch (Not a bad witch). All Japanese animation, in my opinion, is beautiful. And one scene can tell an entire story. My cousin owns and loved this movie, too. We used to play KiKi's Delivery Service when we were little. I would HIGHLY recommend this movie!"
2,Love this bread machine!,I found this bread machine to be excellent. I have made several different kinds from the book that came with it and a few other recipes that I already had. My favorite is the onion rye recipe. I made the pizza recipe which was excellent as well. The machine performs just as it is supposed to and doesn't move around at all on the counter. The controls are easy to use and the bread slides out easily. I am not disappointed that I bought the machine and will be using it between 3 and 4 times a week. It performs so much better than my last machine (Breadman Plus).
2,Wonderful textbook!,"This text book is incredibly thorough, yet concise. Understandable explanations and real-world examples make understanding and applying the concepts easy. The author's sense of humor makes the text that much more enjoyable. The sequencing of chapters and references within the chapters to past or future explanations is helpful. There are practice quizzes at the end of each chapter that are thought provoking and a good test of your understanding of the material. I highly recommend this book."
2,Good but dated,"A great introduction to human factors but it shows its age in its focus, its examples, and its recommendations. Nevertheless, this book makes a good starting point."
2,Great,Exactly as described by seller. Product came quickly and in perfect condition (new)just as stated in ad.
1,Beautifully Done!,I bought this Cd and I have heard the old songs but German Mangandi add a new sence of style to all these songs making them original and up with the times. His music is well known in central america and he is a great musician that has worked very hard to achieve the kind of success he deserves. The person who has never hear of this singer is because he is unfamiliar with the true roots of Central america and El Salvador. I highly recommend this CD to enjoy it for what it is and the new sence of style that you hear in everysong.Different that is what makes a great artist!!!!
2,Better than original,"It does pull in signals better than the original indoor/outdoor antenna, even when mounted under similar conditions. The cable is heavier duty and the connection is waterproofed.As to whether it works better than Directed Electronics 14240 I cannot say.Things to consider between the 2 outdoor antennas (besides the price): Is the greater extension of the Terk antenna important for your mounting consideration (for example to reach out from under eves)? and, Is the color important?"
1,Why was this book published?,"The Cigarette Girl is a sub par book chock full of banal subject matter and pedestrian writing. You don't care about the characters. You've seen this world of shallow movie biz people before. The book is not funny, moving or even slightly insightful. I was left wondering who the author knew in order to get this empty tale published."
1,"Great film, Bad DVD","I was looking forward to this DVD, when I got it, i wished I never ordered this version. The subtitles are embedded on the screen, and if you need spanish subtitles they show up on top of the screen, so basically you have 2 different languages being written on the screen. You can't see what's going on in front of you. I think they should remove this DVD from the Market and keep the one that ""Seville"" released, at least the subtitles are optional. I like this movie a lot, and I will have to buy it again ""the seville"" version. Oh and something else, if you chose the dolby surround, the sound is very bad, it keeps on fading out everynow and then. What a waste of money?"
2,good tunes,"inspiring, the singers voice gives me tingles, i can hang out and relax to it, read Tarot cards, very chill."
2,Mozart: Don Giovanni / Christopher Maltman,"From time to time one gets introduced to a great voice and personality. Christopher Maltman is one of those individuals.I saw him for the first time in a film production JUAN on a transatlantic flight. I was absolutely mesmerized. Then I bought the Salzburger production of Don Giovanni. Love it! Great production, great voice."
2,Outstanding Response,The processing by both AMAZON.COM and the seller/shipper was superb. Actions were prompt and emails were sent by both acknowledging the order and when the shipment was actually made. I could not have been happier with this transaction. Have already ordered more items and plan to continue as the service was so excellent.
2,Loved The Trilogy,I have read all three books in The Flower Trilogy and LOVED them all!!! Really enjoyed this author's writing style. I only wish there was an epilog for this book.
2,Tear tear,... I love this book the pictures are wonderful get this book for anyone at any age it is a magical exsperiance.
1,Drivel,"This is not an advanced book, nor is the indexing comprehensive. I would expect that a ""power user"" would know how to index better. If you attempt to work with multiple dictionaries in FM and then find anything on it within the index - no can do. Writing style is extremely elementary and insulting to a power user (aka other writers). If you can read to the third grade level, you can read this. Much of the information is ""fluff,"" and is not necessary to the teaching. You could cut out 2/3rds and have a useful guide.Printing problems (standard in Framemaker) are not even discussed. This book should be titled: FrameMaker 6: BARELY the Basics."
2,Amazing!!,"I was dying to see this movie since it came out on the theathers but never got the chance to go. So I decided to rent itit and I loved it . They did a good reboot of the classic movie. Would recommend it to anybody who likes a little bit of action,comedy,and sci-fi"
2,THERE IS NO BOOK LIKE THE PRESENT BOOK,"""...people are almost universally unprepared to respond to the vanguard art of our present age...This makes a guidebook indispensable...we have to encounter this art in terms the history of viewing has not prepared us for...Just as there is no art like it, there is no book like the present book...I am beyond measure grateful that Linda Weintraub has undertaken the immense labor that making this art available must have required. All of us who care about art...are greatly in her debt.""Arthur C. Danto, from the Foreword"
1,Cheat Product,"The item I got is different from the image. And the quality of the product is poor. There is no Belkin label on the cable, it looks like the product I got is fake."
1,Self-indulgent and offensively immature.,"This movie aspires to psychologically tense drama and falls well short of the mark in every way. The psychology never develops, and the ""surprise ending"" makes it clear that these characters (or their creator) are just as immature and shallow as they seem. As a result, there simply is no dramatic tension. I suppose that, in the right mood and context, on a big screen, this movie could cast a spell with its fairly good music and good production values. Still, one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in a long time--the only thing worse than the movie itself is watching the deleted scenes!"
1,"Quickly, while were still young!!","This series will never end. It goes on, and on, and on, and on...Opps! Now I'm doing it. The content is a continuing re-hash. What started out as an interesting series has been exploited by page stuffing, cut and paste authorship until the glow has been completely erradicated by this effort at milking extra dollars from loyal fans. Too bad, Robert Jordan once had me as a fan but this is too much...will it take 10, 12 or even 15 books before the publisher lets him out of this overdone dollar game he has been in? It reminds me of ""Friday the 13th - part 13"". If they bought the last one, let's sell the 10 more like it with a fresh coat of paint. Would someone please bring in Reader's Digest to condense this series down to 3 novels?"
2,BUY IT NO MATTER WHAT!!!,"ALL THE RACHET AND CLANK GAMES KIK AZZ AND THIS ONE SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT!!! IF YOU HAVE 1 TO 4 FRIENDS THAN BUY THE HEADSET AND HEAD ONLINE!!! THIS GAME IS GOING TO ROCK!!!11!!!ONE ONE EXCLAMATION EXCLAMATION!!!!11AND YES, I DID KNOW THAT MY CAPS LOCK WAS ON."
1,Works well but not for long,"I purchased this grinder on May 7 and by mid June, I'm having problems with it. The dial that regulates the amount of beans to grind does not work. It just keeps grinding until all of the beans are gone which totally defeats the purpose of having your own grinder. So I called Krups warranty center, and they happen to have a service center locally. They will get around to looking at it 7-10 days after they receive it. In respect to what others have said about static. I agree and LOTS of it. I purchased this machine for coffee grind but I can only imagine how it would be with a fine espresso grind. It's a very messy machine, if you don't mind having to clean the unit and the counter after each use then this won't be an issue for you. I can live with cleaning up after it but I'm really irritated that it has stopped working properly with light use as we only use it 3-4 times per week. In my opinion, a cheap rip-off, don't waste your money."
1,Disappointed,"This movie was just okay. Some good CGI effects, but got boring fast. Barely made it to the end. Had high hopes."
2,A good read from a good author.,"First let us remember this book is fiction not fact. I found this book to be very engaging and well written. Briscoe uses her writing skills to remind us that money doesn't equal no problems. The characters in the book represent everyday people they cheat, they lie, they steal, they hide their true problems and feelings. For this reason I found it a very good read. Keep up the good work Connie."
2,Short annotation of William McLoughlin's biography on Billy Sunday,"The first critical biography of Sunday after his death. McLoughin`s work examines Sunday`s life through numerous interviews including ""Ma"" Sunday and Homer Rodeheaver, and is the first work to make extensive use of the Sunday Papers. Includes a prologue narrating the 1917 New York campaign, the peak of Sunday`s career."
1,Political Nonsense,"If people can't separate fact from Political ""BS""...Oh well...This book was financed and promoted by the same people who tried to smear John McCain in 2000...Shame on you Mr. President and all your ""cronies""..."
1,Read your child a book instead,"Over the last few years, these Leap Pads have come in and out of my house via various garage sales, gifts, etc.. The kids play with them for a very short time, then tire of them, and off they go to Goodwill.So my kids like them for like a day, and that's it. It's just another electronic toy. The little cartridges get lost very easily and then you're stuck with books that won't work.My kids will cuddle up with me and a book everyday, for long periods of time. That's what little kids books are about: bonding with those who love you while learning. Read you child a book instead of plopping them in front of this thing. Teach them the words with your fingers and your voice, not a stylus and a computerized talking box.We don't need batteries to teach our kids to read."
2,excellent entertainment,"Very good product in reasonable price.this is regionfree disc, so You can enjoy it worldwide :)O"
2,Glass Pot,"Superlative!!! It is in perfect condition and replaces the old, favorite one we broke!! We use it almost every day. It must be one of the few remaining ones in the U S A!!!"
1,Not all he's being hype up to be.,"Let me get this out of the way, ""In da club"" is one of the best club songs of all time.Whew! Now,this album is filled with such crap it makes me sick. The only other good tracks are ""Many men"", ""Backdown"", and ""Wangsta"". The rest of the tracks are just repeated attemps to get a single. Real ""thugs"" don't name drop, brag or boast about the things they needed to do to survive. 50 is the platinum plus performance thug he so desperatley tries to critisize. Burn it, copy it from a friend or just turn on the radio; but do yourself a favor and don't waste your money."
1,"Great Movie, lousy transfer.","I have this movie on regular DVD and the quality far exceeds the Blu-ray version. As another reviewer wrote, I have so much noise and a line through the center of the screen, that the movie is not watchable. These things should be recalled."
2,Flip Video carrying case review,Great carrying case for my new Flip Video Mino. Velcro strap holds it securely inside of case and padded case protects my Flip Video.
2,a fine choice,"One of the finer purchases I've made. My night driving is totally changed for the better. The drivers are almost as bright as the headlights, and they go farther down the road. The fogs pierce through ground fog like it wasn't there. Not one approaching vehicle has flipped their lights at me because they are too bright; took about 1/2hr to aim them right. They were a little snug in the front valance of my van, but they do their job. A fine product for most sedans, coupes, minivans or small SUV."
2,swivel seat for car,I bought this swivel seat for my eighty one year old mother who is on the shorter side and has had hip replacement surgery . I thought it may be easier for her to get in and out of the car and it worked . My mother really likes it and it also sits her a little higher in the seat
2,Metaphysical Bible Dictionary,I love this bible dictionary as it explains in metaphysical terminology I can understand and accept.
2,Watchable Action Movie. Rambo Set In The Future. DID ROB SCHNEIDER HAVE TO BE IN IT?!!!,"This action film starring Sylvester ""Rocky Rambo"" Stallone is a pretty decent movie which also stars Diane Lane and Armand Assante. I don't know anything about Judge Dredd, other than he's supposedly a comic book character and he never shows his face or whatever. I liked this film, but my issue with it is Rob Schneider. Did he HAVE TO BE in this movie? Seriously, all the guy knows how to do is raunchy comedy ala Adam Sandler. He was okay in ""Around The World In 80 Days,"" but that was a Disney movie and everyone knows you can't get raunchy in a Disney film. I recommwend this movie. Good action scenes. Could have been longer, though, with additional character development of Judge Dredd and Judge Hershey and maybe even a romance between both of them."
1,Promising start that only fills in the odd crack!,"The Race is written by James Schefter who (after reading the introduction) was one of the frontline reporters of NASA's manned spaceflight program from the mid 1960's. Given that information I assumed that I would learn a lot about what happened behind the scenes in Gemini-Apollo era, rather than the history text book story. And it certainly starts off that way. A great deal of detail goes into the pre-NASA days, the rise of Werner Von Braun, Bob Gilruth and the soviet Chief Designer. A few interesting stories such as the time Neil Armstrong slept in for the first X-15 flight and the tension between Chris Kraft and Scott Carpenter fill in some of the gaps, but I'm left feeling that given the author, a lot more could have been said. This book isn't in the same league as Andrew Chaikin's 'A Man on the Moon'. Only for the dedicated space cadet!"
1,"Very, very small",I have never seen earrings so small. I think they would be good for a little girl. They were very hard to open up...in fact one wouldn't open at all. I'm going to return them.
1,Disappointing,"I read four good reviews and one bad review, so I figured I probably wouldn't have any problems. Unfortunately, the one bad review was right on in my case. While this product would have been very useful, and I'm sure it works 4 times out of 5, if you're the fifth time then it is absolutely useless. Lexar Media's tech support even had this cool 24 hour online chat help, but when I actually used it they were not even remotely helpful, and just tried to ignore me until I went away. When I finally made them say something useful, they told me to return the product... So if you don't have any problems returning something if it doesn't work, then go ahead and take a shot, because when it does work everyone else seems to love it!"
1,Worst Product Ever,"Purchased two lights (2 year warranty). Both lights failed at 8 months. Returned and replaced both lights. One of the two replacements failed after 6 days. Returned and replaced the failed light, replacement lasted only one day before failing.If you order, save your shipping box: you are going to need it!"
1,blows,just got windows me. It is the worst o/s I have ever seen. It crash's 10 times more then windows 98 and if you work at home and have windows 2000 and like to make the computer a twin boot it won't work well with it. Just don't buy it.
1,watch out -- need the VAD-RA adaptor,"Maybe this lens is great, but Amazon does not indicate that the VAD-RA adaptor is needed to attach it -- and that is currently unavailable."
1,"Startlingly Bad, Definitely Unwatchable","Not even a rental. I wasted my time and money on this, but you don't have to.The script is read like some sort of weird awkward dress rehearsal. There is a really odd and painful sort of Cyrano de Bergerac-like scene between the three characters that is just strange given the way direction handled it. Anyway enough details. The movie never gets interesting or funny. One of those movies you keep watching in the hopes it'll pick up, but never does."
2,Real Simple Magazine,"Love the magazine! I always find the information useful, great recipes, coupons, and pictures. I like skimming through the magazine and finding the helpful hints/tips on the bottom of the pages."
1,Why make a remote with no backlight?,"At the fundamental level this remote works.However, certain design flaws hurt its usability. The lack of backlight is a huge usability issue. Unless you are watching with lights on, you can't see the buttons! The lack of a power-off button is major omission, as well. I really can't figure out why this was left out. While I am not happy that the PS3 does not natively support an IR remote, that's a complaint about the PS3, and not about this remote. If it were an IR remote, however, I could teach the commands to my universal, and I wouldn't care about the backlighting issue..."
2,Not a fan of serrated knives,"I've had this knife set for more than 2 years, and they've been pretty good. They aren't quite as sharp as they used to be, though you can still cut (by tearing), since they're serrated.I didn't realize these were serrated - I just saw that they were Henckels and on sale. Next time, read the description carefully.Most of the people who have used these knives haven't been really impressed with them. Unlike unserrated knives, these require a slight sawing motion to cut; it makes a mess of slicing tomatoes. It's very difficult to sharpen serrated knives, so you'll have to get it done by a professional.If I'd known that these were serrated, I wouldn't have bought them so I could save my money for a real Henckels set.Also, the additional cheese knife doesn't fit into the block, so some knife has to go in a drawer."
2,Best book of 1997!,"I picked up this book on a road trip around Colorado and spent a good portion of the trip with my face buried in the pages, and not taking in the stunning scenery. I LOVED this book, loved the chances Ms. Chance took with the characters, loved how she made me care about them, despite some pretty dubious backgrounds. The whole relationship between Lily and Tex was handled with such subtlety and restraint that the tension--emotional and otherwise--made me squirm. I loved that Lily was strong and tough when she needed to be, and that Tex loved that part of her--when he finally got to know the 'real' Lily, the lady beneath what she'd become. This is 'the' book I hand to romance detractors, male and female, and say 'I dare you to learn otherwise'. Everyone I've given it to has been pleasantly surprised, including a male friend who stayed up until 2 in the morning because he 'had to know how it ended'. Thanks, Ms Chance, for taking risks and making me care!"
2,Fantastic!,"This is a fantastic children's book that addresses a young child's hurt feelings with his divorced mother plans to marry a new man. The vocabulary is well chosen and expresses very well the feelings of insecurity a young child may feel when a new ""father"" enters the family. The book abounds with love and humor - especially when the young boy misunderstands the meaning of ""bearer""! Lastly, the art work is extraordinary and wonderfully whimsical! I'm buying it for my grandson."
1,Slowest shipping ever!,"Not only was the poster a tad bit bigger then the advertised size (which makes in look wrinkled in a frame), but they took FOREVER to ship it! It came wayyyyyy after the estimated delivery date due to them shipping it late. I would NEVER order with this seller again!"
2,California Hardcore,"This great DVD contains four classic California punk shows originally released on VHS (Flipside Video Vols. 1 and 6). Two early punk bands, the Weirdos (in 1986) and the Dickies (in 1985) are paired with two hardcore bands, Circle Jerks and Bad Religion (both in 1984). A multiple-camera setup is used for each show and the loud sound seems to be from the soundboard, preserving the chaotic shows in all their ragged glory. The bands blaze through their sets as the stage divers dance among them and sometimes grab the mikes. Get it, you punk!"
2,Very good and dependable material !!,"There is not that many books out there that covers the extensive topic of qualifying for the CCIE written.This book is well written for readers to know all the topics involve in the exam.With this reference and a combined additional resources from author like Jeff Doyle , Cisco press and Cisco technology page you'll definitely pass.Great work John S. ."
2,Revealing Insights,"Wauu - you get some insights, that are so obvious you wonder why nobody has seen or described this before the two authors did. An eye opener in a class of itself."
2,The Tracks,"1Thunder Rolls2 Dance3 Mr. Blue4 Against the Grain5 One Night A Day6 River7 Not Counting You8 Friends In Low Places9 Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)10 Standing Outside the Fire11 Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House12 Callin' Baton Rouge13 If Tomorrow Never ComesAdditional Track Information Hats Off A Tribute to Garth Brooks music CD"
1,Didn't float my boat,"Flowers for Algernon provided entertainment in the biggining explaining his operation and sad stories, but I found that it was all downhill from there. I feel the book goes too in depth about Charlie's feelings on relationships. Not one of my favorites."
2,Takes me Away!,"Everytime I listen to this CD, it just takes me away to fairy tale land. I love the opening song 'Wishing on a Star'. And Kissing Town theme. If you love the 10th Kingdom, then you will love this soundtrack."
2,First skateboard ever--for a thirty-something old!,"Ok, just made a friend who was a skateboarder, so I wanted to have something that I could try to learn on. I couldn't believe the great deal on this board compared to other boards that were identical except the graphics on the bottom (it's WAY more now than what I paid...). Anyway, I couldn't be happier. It's a decent quality board and I'm having fun--and so are my kids! We'll never be skaters, but it's still fun to have a solid quality skateboard around just for kicks!"
2,Boyhood Dreams,"As a boy, I was fascinated by looking at all of the drawings and descriptions in this diary. It gave me a great appreciation for life in the US in the early 1800s, and the fortitude and ingenuity of our forefathers. I have found that the magic still holds, as I read it to each of my sons when they were about 8. They still love the basic how-to descriptions which bring frontier construction to life!"
2,The Snow Walker,I have flown in these areas and this movie gave me chills. Very well done and accurate.
1,Disappointed,"Purchased this flag from Seven Brothers Mercantile. The wrong flag arrived. When I contacted them to bring this to their attention I was really surprised by their reaction. It was explained to me that not all the images are correct. So in short if you order a flag by the picture you see don't be surprised if a different one shows up. Example if you ask for an American Flag you might get a British Union Flag both are Red, White and Blue after all."
1,Get this book off the shelves,How can we still be selling a book that advocates child abuse? No one should buy this book.
2,anxious to receive,I was anxious to receive my cd's.Really no need to be worried though.They arrived 2 days lateand I have them.
1,"1 word, 1 star: Horrible","One of my friends owns this phone and I tried using it. I think it's an overall horrid design. The phone itself only has a few settings and is the most ugliest thing I've ever seen. It's hard to navigate and even worse to use.Just because it's `thin' is no reason to get it, because instead of being `chunky' like other phones it's a lot wider to make up for the `thinness'.Don't go near this phone. You'll thank me for it in the end."
2,What no fuel smell and mess?,I used this lantern in my living quarters in Iraq when the generators were down for maintenance. Great source of light and the LED nite light is definately a stubbed toe protector in the dark of the desert. If/when this one fails I will buy another to replace it.
1,What a hassle!,I had understood this juicer to be one of the best available. Nobody mentioned that you had to repeatedly scrape out and clean out the basket or it didn't work. I thought you just put the fruit/vegetable in and out came a lot of juice and some very dry pulp. My pulp was extremely soggy and the juice was loaded with pulp too. I used a whole peck of apples to make 4 cups of extremely thick pulpy juice - what a waste of my time and money.
1,Nail and Staple setting Tool,Waste of money. Any DIY planning to do a flooring job spend the money on something more useful.If you take care in setting the pressure on your porta nailer you will not need to use the setting tool.
1,Waste of time,"I was diagnosed with IC and thought my life was over...I went to so many doctors and got no answers. I found this book and decided to follow it whole heartedly.Following the advice of this book wasted a lot of my precious time in pain. I remember that time being horrific, I was peeing on strips of paper and I was in a maze of what was causing my burning every time I peed and why I was peeing every few minutes I also was sure I had a yeast infection, even though my cultures came back negative I felt itching and irritation.I went to a pelvic floor physical therapist and within a few treatments I was not peeing often and it did not burn. cured. My constricted tissues were causing a hystamine reaction. I now eat everything I want and don't take any special supplements or anything like that. This book was a waste of time for me. Also there is no medical proof behind her alkaline/acid theory."
1,Cant Recommend,"Purchased those to compare and they were cheap, but you get what you pay for. If you need a tweeter maybe or something that produces high frequency, as general speakers no way."
1,"Best Friends,but not the best book","The first in the SVT series,we are introduced to Jess and Liz at 12 years of age,when Jessica first meets the Unicorn Club,and Elizabeth first does something particular with her writing."
2,Pods--I need those pods!,"After lots of research we decided to buy not one, but two Bunn coffee makers that use pods. And after more research we decided we liked the pods by Maxwell House the best. And we bought them by the case. And now--no more pods by Maxwell House! And after writing to MH, you'd think they'd help by telling me where I might find the last remaining packages, but no, nothing other than a ""Sorry!"" So, even if you find some, I'd not recommend them, because if you like their flavor....Sorry, no more available!"
2,trish brings me bliss,"follow up to my comment made on May 17, 2005i didn't c da dvd but i bet it was hot because trish status is hot whatever she does will be hot God and Jesus i miss trish status i wish she could have stayed in the wwe for another five years but i have to admit that she paid her dues and is now enjoying her labor i know that one day she will return to the wwe and give it her all she is one of the best lady wrestlers of her generation as well as the sexiest and most beautiful women i have ever seen she always took sexy pictures and this one with tight light brown shirt and skirt is no different it is up there with sable famous summerslam naked photo"
2,"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","By Far the best concert BluRay you will ever own. Sound quality is mind boggling. The concert footage is crystal clear. I've been to 12 RUSH concerts and this is as close to the real thing as you will get. ASTONISHING!!! Play it loud, it just gets better. The better the equipment the better the experience. The camera angles around Getty, Alex and especially Niel are fanominal. If you have any interest in RUSH buy it. If you looking for a Xmas gift for a Rush fan THIS IS IT!!!!!!!!!RRRUUUSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!RUSH: Snakes and Arrows Live [Blu-ray]"
1,Broken Jar!!!,We recieved a broken jar of olives and the varieties were not the ones that came in the variety pack!
1,Nothing new here.,"Warning warning Will Robinson! There is nothing new here! Our beloved author basically summarizes and remixes his earlier work Holy Blood Holy Grail like a DJ at an all night rave, which in it's self, was based mostly on conjecture and theories (the book not the rave).If you like money and would love to buy something for oh say $20 DO NOT buy this book. It is a total waste of time and paper... those poor trees.However on the overall idea of the book, I'd have to say it's a nice story and very inventive however the fact that it lacks a shred of any sort of corroborating evidence in it's self should be enough to help people decide that both Baigent's earlier work and Brown's funny novel are in no way true but simply works of fiction. However people will of course take these works to heart and we will be descended into chaos, dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!"
2,fine,"works greatcheap and they work, what more can you ask for...works greatcheap and they work, what more can you ask for..."
2,what do i do?,"Hello Tom, I haven't actually read your strategy guid yet but I have a question (sorry for not reading it yet!)Um.. Im on mission six in Rainbow Six where you have to rescue the hostages. Well I can only find two, could you tell me where the others are?Thanx, Nolan"
1,A vacuum to avoid,"I wish I had read the reviews of the Bissell Digipro prior to buying this vacuum. I would have known that debris gathers in the floor nozzle, they hose is very flimsy and tends to break, most of the exhaust escapes around the edges of the canister, the suction is quite weak and it is virtually impossible to find bags and even more difficult to find any store or internet site that carries parts for this model. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews and had to learn all of this first hand. Despite having spent several hundred dollars, I've learned from my mistake: The Digipro is going in the trash and I'm going shopping for a new vacuum. It might be an Eureka or Hoover, both of which we've had good experiences with, but it won't be a Bissell."
1,Not as good as others,"I'm a librarian so I was really excited to get this book for my daughter, who loves CG (22 months). But, the story is not at all interesting and is too long. When my daughter sees me pull it out, she actually says, ""Bleah."" She might just be too young for it--but she really likes the CG visits the zoo book."
1,Would not buy again,"I was generally pleased with this GPS system--my first--when it worked. I liked the big screen and it was pretty user-friendly. Occasionally it would lose signal in a weird spot, but it wasn't a big problem. About 2 weeks after we bought the thing it died--would not turn on at all. So we took it back and they gave us another one. It worked fine for about 3 months, then when I tried to turn it on today it was dead as a doornail once again. My husband is a systems analyst and electronics whiz, so I'm pretty sure it's nothing we're doing wrong. Back to the store it goes tomorrow, and we're getting a Garmin or Magellan. This was my first and last experience with Harman Kardon."
2,Delightful mystery for young readers,"This story was my young child's first introduction to mysteries, and I haven't stopped reading it yet. It captured his interest quickly and kept him spellbound until the very end when the mystery is solved (with no violence or explosive action scenes). He still requests it, even though he knows the outcome, because he loves both the story and the charming characters. We plan to purchase the remaining Otto and Uncle Tooth books soon and hope they are as entertaining as this one."
2,I never really liked transformers,"I was in my 20's when the original transformers cartoon and toys came out. I never really got into the original show because of this. I found this series by accident and only kept watching because it was CGI done by the same company that did Reboot.I found that the stories were not dumbed down to make it ""kid friendly"" it was just good sci-fi."
1,it was supposed to be a gift.,"i haven't played the game yet, I'm not even sure I'll keep it. i was disappointed that the game did not come wrapped in plastic, (game pieces were) and I'm not happy with the fact that there was a sticker that said ""3.99"" on the package and it won't come off without ripping the box.the packing slip specified that the game is new w/o plastic, but i didn't see that anywhere on the website...I'm not happy, but i may be SOL..."
2,*Beautiful* acoustic music,"Traveler's Prayer is a personal favorite, with tasteful renditions of traditional favorites (I Saw Three Ships, Bunyan's Hymn, At the Break of Day - known to me as Be Thou My Vision) and original melodies powerful in their simplicity and clarity. This recording has always impressed me for it's production values, best realized on a quiet evening with no interruptions."
1,"After Dragon Mountain, this?","I had just purchased Dragon Mountain, touted as an epic adventure, and found pages and pages of... kobolds? I was seriously upset. I payed serious money for this thing! Now, Axe of the Drarven Lords. Goblins? What is with this! I am looking for modules to 1) entertain, 2)intrigue, and 3) challenge my players. I find nothing entertaining, intriguing or challenging about using Goblins for players whose characters are over 3rd level.Don't buy this module if you can help it! I'd have given it 0 stars if that were an option."
2,The song Nature BOY,"seems no one recognizes the same Nature boy classic ie with rodger williams, or nst king cole can also be found on the moulin rouge soundtrack!:)"
1,no cover,i dont like not getting the actual case to my dvd. i wasnt expecting that at all and was aggravated when i seen there was no cover.
1,Not worth it,"Unfortunately had to use this one for two corses. It's a paperweight and nothing more. The set up of the text is good but most of the time it felt like the guy got bored. Basically, here is a start and the rest do your own reasearch. If you have lots of spare time on your hands, this book is for you. If not, try David Anderson's books instead."
1,V-Smile Pocket Review,"My 3 year old absolutely loves this toy and the games are such that he can understand and play them. The games are educational and hold his attention endlessly. However, the game itself is cheaply made in that connections (such as to the television, to the cartridge or the rechargeable battery console) often don't work and have to be jiggled and moved around to get the game to operate. The company needs to improve the quality of the console but otherwise the game is fantastic."
1,Misleading Add,"This product from Backstore advertises it is the ""fully loaded"" Herman Miller Mirra chair, but as you scroll down to product description, it is in fact the ""highly adjustable"" model. There is a difference. Presumably this has no tilt and thus is not ""fully loaded""."
2,A Cat Named Darwin,"This was a good book, a little drawn out sometimes, but otherwise a very good read. I am a lover of cats, so this was one that I read just because it was a cat book. I must admit I did shed a couple tears, so yeah a tear jerker, but def a good read."
1,C97953 SakonPro 30 molecular Steam hairsetter,"Sorry, it is a very cumbersome product.I don't like it.Gave it away to my hairdresser.Description and Users-Guide should state that it is to STRAIGHTEN kinky hair with steam.I wanted a CURLER, not a starightener."
2,Belgian Waffles,"First Waffle Maker I have ever had, so can not really do a comparison, but this is a great machine. The speed and ease of making waffles is amazing! This is now used every weekend."
2,Deceptive Packaging/love the product,"Product container has ""false bottom"", a space of almost 1.5 inchs! It seems like you are getting about twice the product, but you aren't. Beware."
2,Pike's vampire is the ONLY vampire.,"Best vampire story ever. Sure, some might argue that some of our blood-sucking heroine's feats are ridiculously far-fetched, but c'mon, it's fiction. I just like that the plot is really fast-paced, engaging, and has a solid foundation. Pike's interpretation of the vampire makes more sense than some other vampire characters. Plus, she could probably kick their butts. The Last Vampire rules!"
1,This one didn't do it for me.,I got through about 75% of this book and lost interest. I have read many books related to this subject and did not find this one very helpful.
2,Great for what it is.... and what it costs....,"This humidifier works great for its size. I chose the ""warm mist"" over the cool mist for several reasons (which I won't get into with this review). It's silent except for the occasional blurp of the water advancing down into the boiler section. Easy re-filling and cleaning makes this unit very attractive. Sure helps make the house more comfortable during the Winter months!I was able to buy this humidifier @ Home Depot for less than Amazon.com was selling it for ($39), but thought I'd give it a good review on here nevertheless...."
2,Making the Old New Again,"Beginnings, endings, murder, sex, adultery, treachery. The Bible is full of it all. Our Christian history. The Thompson Student Bible is a very readable, easy to use more youthful addition of the Thompson Chain Reference Bible. This bible has 45 portraits of such bible greats as Moses, Job, John the Baptist, Miriam and more linking their accomplishments with the verses where they are found. Study aids that give background information and history on the Bible, a list of fulfilled prophecies concerning Jesus Christ, charts on Bible People, and maps. This bible is one of the most complete I have seen."
1,Poor Connection - Does Palm Care?,"The connection to the Palm Tungsten T is so loose as others mention that the charge light goes on and off by itself. Its hard to believe that a reputable company can say that this works for this model. I wish i had read these comments before i purchased it. The bulky original cradle is such a piece of [junk] that im thinking of switching to a Microsoft PDA due to the better designs from the companies making them - don't laugh, i switched from Nikon to Canon Digital Camera's due to Canon's much better charger which needs no wires. The travel charger doesnt seem to be a solution - Palm, get your act together before you lose ALL your customers!"
2,Very good for the intended purpose,"I bought this too keep squirrels and racoons from getting into the feeder on my deck and eating all the seed. Other feeders that I bought were either totally wiped out by squirrels or destroyed by racoons. This feeder is great for keeping them out.Some larger birds like jays and cowbirds that I would prefer not ravaging the feeder, still manage to hang on from the side and knock seed out. They are only occasionaly successful, so I am pleased in general."
2,Great Movie!,"This is an absolutely wonderful movie. I've seen a lot of Meryl Streep movies, and this is probably her best role. She should have an Academy Award for it. If you aren't crying and cheering by the end of the movie, you were asleep during most of it. It is a great show!"
1,a lie,"there is a spell contained in theis book (the spell of making) which reads... ...ANAIL NATHROCK UTHVASS BETHUDD DOCHIEL DIENVIEthe truth to the spell is that it translates to the gaelic version of mary had a little lamb. otherwise, a good learning tool."
1,Disappointed in Can Opener,I like the style and color (black) of the can opener. I like that it will open tall cans. It operates quickly once you are able to get it to pick up the can.I did not like how it shreds the paper on the outside of the can. It leaves a mess on the counter and sometimes the shredded paper gets in the can or stuck in the can opener's gear.I would not recommend it.
2,A LONG time coming...,"Well it's been 10+ years but they finally did it. The newest incarnation of the GREATEST RPG has landed. Dungeons & Dragons 3E is a fantastic change to the last rules update that was more than ten years old. A solid game mechanic, with lotsa ""stuff"" to make a hero to be proud of. I just can't wait to see what comes next from Skip, Monte and the gang! Thanks, finally!"
2,Goelogy: A Self-Teaching Guide,Excellent self study book for those of us that learned Geology years ago and have a renewed interest. the end
1,Unhappy,"I bought this product based on the name ""Bausch & Lomb"", and boy was I disappointed. The thing looks and works more like something one would purchase at ""Only a Buck"" stores. I was very disappointed in the look,feel,and performance of this product. Just another example of a good name being attached to an inferior product to make a buck."
2,A good stick bag for beginners,"I bought this bag for my daughter as she began drumming in the school band. It appears to be made of durable material, the zipper is good, and it will hold a variety of sticks and mallets. I would like to see an inner pocket for drum key(s), but other than that, this is a very servicable stick bag."
2,Did its job,My boys are heavy into monste trucks. This DVD was very Loud. the music was a bit much and overshadowed the trucks themselves.
1,Didn't work for my computer,I don't know if my older (2000) compaq presario with windows me was just to old for this thing but it never worked. The top ports never worked and the back ports worked for my keyboard and printer until I tried to plug my camera into a port on the top and then my whole computer crashed. The only way I could get it to reboot was by unplugging the hub. I was never able to get it to work with my computer again without crashing.
1,worst popcorn maker on the planet,"Horrible popcorn maker and way over priced. I got this as a gift and it blows, and it blows the popcorn everywhere. the kernals pop mid air so stand back. 40% of them were on the floor."
2,DeJa Vu hit home,"I rented DeJa Vu and Cassablanca both on the same weekend. I had never seen either movie and was so shocked to see the similarities. I was in tears with both movies and felt that the director of DeJa Vu should have chosen a younger sexier actress than Victoria Foyt. I thought she had too many temper tantrums and could of portrayed more passion. I would of liked to have seen more of the love scenes also...I felt the house party scene was very good. It had me on the edge of my seat and I felt like I was right there in the room with the actors. I really enjoyed the line that went something like.... ""An Illusion is really the feeling of something good coming close""."
2,Can't live without Kerastase,"I've tried many types of hair products and Kerastase is the best. It is expensive but it works. Several times I have stopped using it because I get tired of spending $35 on shampoo, but every time I notice a decline in my hair after a few weeks using something else. There's a reason it costs $35, it's because it works! Now I just stick with Kerastase."
2,America's Mathemagician Has Another Winner!,Terry Stickels' Mind-Bending Puzzle series (soon to be 4 volumes and 7 card decks... plus his yearly calendar) is still the best thing going in puzzle land. Even the legendary Martin Gardner is a fan. ( He has written the forward for the first in this series.) I hope Pomegranate Publishing keeps producing his material... they do an excellent job.
1,it was just okay,"we bought this nursery tent to take to the beach with us to protect our 9 month old son from the sun. we liked the mesh netting which allowed air to flow through the tent. however, one day was pretty windy and the anchors provided are not sturdy enough to secure it. the wind toppled it over with our son lying inside. it didn't blow away or very far since we were sitting right next to it, but it still toppled over. i wouldn't recommend it for a trip to the beach!"
1,A Real Snoozer,"If you want to waste the time just borrow a friends copy but DON'T waste the money buying this novel yourself. I read another of Lance's books entitled ""A Byte of Charity"" and was hooked from the first chapter. However, ""Reel Pressure"" starts off really slow, picks up in the middle, and has an ending that seems to drag on forever leaving me with no feelings of satisfaction once I was finished. I don't know if that's his way of getting me to buy his next book but it didn't work."
1,what utter garbage,"yeah while there were times of tenderness (the close-ups of karen allen, the scenes at Bill Murray's brothers home (of course reminiscent of Scrooge's own nephews feast), the film seemed rushed in every scene, especially the ending, after he finds out he didn't die, its just horrid. What was funny about it? Oh and what about the whole disgustingly rushed Ghost of Xmas Past scenes, I know 14 year olds who can do a better job at creating that Ghost and how unoriginal, I mean really. So far so original, but, those scenes, just deplorable. Ahhh with more Bill Murray's over acting in nearly everything he does, or the fact that the only really PURE Gem, was Carol Kane playing the fairy as Ghost of Christmas Present, she was just stellar. But sadly, nearly everyone's career in this movie went nowhere and for a reason, and if you think Karen Allen doing Indy stuff was stellar, well, I will give you that...."
1,Very hard to follow,I did not find this to be an enjoyable read at all. The story was very hard to follow and I would not recommend it.
2,The Manchurian Candidate meets the Japanese Prisoner of War.,I honor this author for his time in Japanese POW camps. The horror he went through shaped this book. Who knows what they would do under the mental and physical torture inflicted by evil men?
2,Pretty good for a cheapo blender,"Like most under-$100 blenders these days, the $40 Michael Graves blender from Target is made in China. It feels lightweight, and the plastic buttons have a flimsy feel to them. Also, they are hard to clean between. (Why, oh why, do 90% of all blenders use this stupid multiple-button speed control system instead of a nice, simple rotary dial?) As Stuart Gathman noted below, this is not the blender to buy if you want a rugged, heavy-duty model, but it's fine for light work and it IS stylish. (If you want something more rugged, for well under $100 you can get a good Oster, KitchenAid or Hamilton Beach model that will outlast this Graves/Target model by years.)"
1,Waste of Time,"Plain and simple, this is shabbily constructed and poorly edited documentary. It is certainly more manipulative of facts than the news channel it lambasts, and that is a problem when the subject really is accuracy in media.If you are looking for a solid documentary, look elsewhere.Too many reviewers here seem to be using their stars to express their approval or disapproval of Fox, but Fox is not what is being reviewed here on Amazon. Instead, reviewers should focus on Outfoxed and its merits or lack thereof. Listen, I am a fan of McDonalds (both the company and the fries), but I thought Supersize Me was excellent. Do I agree with everything in Supersize Me? Of course not. But do I think it was an entertaining, well-constructed documentary (of sorts)? You bet!Fox is biased, and the Pope is Catholic; neither is an original enough thought to sustain a feature-length documentary. It doesn't really matter what you think of Fox, but Outfoxed is a waste of an hour or so of your life."
1,"noisy, blows dirty away and a small head","a. Machine makes more noise than our regular vacb. b. Exhaust blows dirt away. The fan blows out the air in front of the vac, so if you trying to vac something light, you will be running after itc. The machine head is smalld. No place to store the cordAfter reading all the fantastic reviews, I am wondering whether people have been paid to write all these good things."
2,Great workout,"I loved this video. I have not been exercising regularly prior to pregnancy and this video has a great beginner level which can take you a long way. What I loved most about this video is that it helped me get over my fear about what I can and cannot do with my body during pregnancy since this is my first child. I love the fact that the exercises have a lot of impact and you really feel you are getting a good workout, not just doing simple exercises."
1,Buyer Beware,This DVD states that you can play the DVD using English as the language spoken in the film. After 16 minutes of English the DVD uses Spanish as the spoken language. The movie was great for the first 16 minutes until the movie used Spanish as the spoken language. Please beware of this major problem with the DVD.
2,Love this show!,I love this show. The settings in this set are even more beautiful than the last set. I can't wait for set 3!
1,Sad representation of Head East,"This truly is a poor excuse for a CD. The sound is poor, the performances sadly under represents the band. Head East was an energetic band, their music had a definite zest and vitality. Avoid this product at all costs. A&M needs to give some serious thought to re-releasing Head East Live. (Yes, re-release Head East Live was available for a short time as a domestic release, why it was pulled we'll never know). Hopefully A&M will realize there are people looking for this CD out there. In the meantime you can get the abbreviated version of Head East Live by buying Head East Live on Stage. Flat as a Pancake is also an enjoyable alternative."
1,Go Duke!,Kind of sappy writing but it was great fun to follow the 2001 year and hear some of Coach K's strategies and his take on each of the players. He described each game from that year and that was fun for me because I remember almost all of them.
1,Junk,Tossed these in the trash not long after getting them. Couldn't keep them clean to save my life and they didn't fit a standard cookie sheet anyhow.
1,unhappy in lebanon,i thought this would latin misic on a classical guitar. it is more of a production with a orchestra. not what i was lookinf for.
1,boooring,after reading the first few pages i put it down... tried again put did the same thing. this book is not catching at all. don't take the time to read it.
2,Beautiful Voice and Music,"Gwen Stefani can make her voice high pitched or can rap with a deep voice. The two best songs on here are ""Hollaback Girl"" and ""Rich Girl."" Both have her good singing and rapping voice making the songs what they are. The album does have a little too much adult material for kids under 12 or 13 though. But this is a classic that any of America's youth (ages 12+) should have as they grow up today."
1,Keep away from your dog,"I purchased these based on the ""good"" reviews that it had received. I have a Shiba Inu who loves to chew and thought this would be the perfect answer. I did not know that the ""Gnawhide treats"" were so EASY to choke on. After my dog finished his treat, he was choking excessively and threw up everything. I recommend you stay away from this product. FYI, my dog is medium size and I got the so called medium sized treat."
2,This book changed my life!,"First off, I am 26 years old and still moved by this book, along with the other companion booksA Wind in the DoorandA Swiftly Tilting Planet. I actually re-read it yesterday, for the 4th time in my life and it still affects me the way it did when I first read it, back in the 5th grade. I actually hated reading until my 5th grade teacher (Ms. Cantor, thank you!) introduced us to this book and I was hooked! My love for reading all started with this one.I am just so amazed and inspired by this book, and am so curious to know where Ms. L'Engle (RIP) got her inspiration from; it's as if she were there herself.If you've never read this book, give it a try, no matter what age you are. I'm sure Ms. L'Engle is now a star, singing the song of the universe! Bottom line, her words just make me feel connected to everything and everyone, and I truly appreciate her contribution to us."
1,A misstep backwards,"This is one of those records where fans of early work will say, ""It's rad, just like her early stuff, dude!"" After all, she's returned to the same (non-)production team and stripped-down band which created her first two records (which include 'Rid of Me' - one of the most overrated alternative pieces of the 1990s). Unfortunately, the record is a regression in every sense.For those of us who thought P.J. Harvey grew up (musically and lyrically) with 1995's refereshingly schitzophrenic 'To Bring You My Love' and 1998's wonderfully narrative 'Is This Desire' (aided by Flood's superior production), this offering is very disappointing. The dark melodies and tongue-in-cheek quality of her last two records has been supplanted by the dry, monosyllabic rumblings that are all too characteristic of her earlier material."
2,Mirror Mirror,Really good movie. Enjoyed the new take on the 7 dwarfs and Snow White. It's a good movie to watch and have a good laugh.
1,Mimi's Diva Dryer,This is an absolute waste of money and it is ridiculously hard to maneuver. Thumbs down. I returned mine.
1,"Tiny Print, bad quality","Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma is a great book, the content is comprehensive and amazingly dense. However, I was deeply disappointed when this book arrived because the text size is tiny and it is a facsimile so the print quality is poor too. The pages waste space because there is a large margin and I find the book practically unusable. A waste of money. Don't buy this book unless you've seen it: TAN must digitally reset this Catholic classic."
1,I would give it no stars but I couldn't post my review with none!!,"I received the battery I purchased in packaging that was like new, however, the battery didn't hold a charge at all and had to be returned. The policy of this vendor is that they don't take back defective items so I had to return it to the manufacturer and I still haven't received the replacement (several weeks now)."
2,An Interesting Study of Stepfamily Life,"This book is a ""scholarly"" work, but still readable. The author teaches at Baylor University and did a clear, lengthy study of certain types of stepfamilies in Texas. The results are highly interesting. Anyone who cares about stepfamily life would benefit by reading this interesting analysis.George Barna and others are reporting that the divorce rate inside the church is the same as outside. Why isn't Christianity responding with more help for divorced people and stepfamilies? If you're interested, search Amazon for books by Rev. Ron Deal and Dr. David Frisbie, two experts in this.Bray's book belongs in the library of everyone who studies stepfamilies.It is well-written, thoroughly researched, and highly interesting.Barbara Sheldon, M.S.W.I also highly recommend:Happily Remarried: *Making Decisions Together *Blending Families Successfully* Building a Love That Will Last"
1,STOP IT ALREADY! DO NOT COME HOME EVER AGAIN!,"'Halloween part 6 The Curse of Michael Myers' is the worst entry in the series so far! After a fairly good installment with 'Halloween part 4 The Return of Michael Myers', they followed it up with, what I thought was the worst Halloween movie ever 'Halloween part 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers'.Now we have the abysmal 'Halloween part 6'. This movie is not only boring, it doesn't even try to be consistent with it's past sequels. What happened to Dr. Loomis's Scars on his face and hands? Why is Michael so big and brawny now? Why do they change the Shape's mask in every movie? This movie makes Jason X look like an Oscar winner! I have not seen the director's cut, but I doubt extra footage and editing could fix this boring and stupid mess! This almost makes Halloween part 5 look good!"
1,Denis Leary = Satan's errand boy,"""No Cure For Cancer"" is an abominable disgrace. As many others have pointed out, Denis Leary plagiarized Bill Hicks. I'm not one of those people who shout ""plagiarism!"" at the slightest hint of similarity but this is just too blatant to ignore. I'm no lawyer but Hicks may have had a legal case against Leary if he stayed alive long enough to pursue it. If I could give ZERO stars, I would."
1,Stiles still doesn't get it,"The only similarity between this book and Liar's Poker is that they are both about Wall Street. Rather than blame himself for seeking out and then accepting a job he knew he was ill-prepared for, in a city he knew nothing about, Stiles blames everyone and everything else. This, in essence, is why Stiles never made it. NYC and Wall Street are not the types of places for people who are always waiting for something to come to them - you have to go out and get it.Stiles book has some interesting passages, though it is very clear that he still does not understand why it didn't all work out. Despite the fact that he was ""never trained"", his passages about the Mexican Peso devaluation and the Orange County Scandal are good summaries. If you work on Wall Street, this book will be entertaining. If you are thinking of working on Wall Street and are as naive as Stiles about ""the life"", this book will be useful. Otherwise, take a pass and read Michael Lewis's Liar's Poker."
1,Shame on the studio,"I am all for capitalism, but New Line needs to know their audience and understand they are smarter than the average bear !!! NFW are we going to fall for the same gimmick twice. Just wait, this thing will be on torrent sites so fast your head will spin, because of a bad business decision by New Line. Wait for the extended version to come out and then invest in one of the greatest movie series ever produced."
2,Worth the price,"I searched for noise cancelling headphones and these showed up in the list. I paid for them with birthday money so I wasn't really thinking much about the price. These are definitely not noise cancelling headphones. However, they are good headphones. I do no like earbuds and these are a good substitute. They are comfortable even with my glasses. The adjustment is good especially the one to keep the speaker tight against the ear. That's what they call noise cancelling. These are equivalent to normal headphones slightly pushed against your head. The sound is good without having to keep your hands there."
2,Shiver Me Timbers!,"A profound writing on the tumultuous, sea-going times of the Golden Age of Pirates, from 1692-1725. Raiders and Rebels, though a historical work, sparks as much imagination as a well-written novel and speaks with an amazing amount of clarity and excitement. A fantastic read, I loved every minute! I recommend it to anyone who's ever dreamt of those swashbuckling days of a bygone, but not forgotten era. Wow! Great job Frank!"
1,Completely useless,One set stopped working after a few weeks and another would not extend the signal to the next room. Now I use TERK from Best Buys and is perfect even at the far end of the house and good looking too.
2,Sturdy and Affordable,"I've climbed nearly to the top of this latter, and it feels very secure. The shelf offers enough space to hold several items. Well worth the price."
1,Not for amateurs!! :),"Just want to warn potential buyers that the kit only includes plastic parts. Considering the price, this makes sense.You will need to have/buy round cake pans (or square pans) in multiple sizes for the cakes. Make sure the larger tiers are big enough so that you are able to position the turrets/castle towers along side the cake sitting atop the base cake.You DEFINITELY need to secure the towers with dowels as other reviewers have said...unless you plan to just shove them into the cake, which also works, but is not as stable or attractive.Decorating the towers is tedious and time-consuming, so be prepared.You can get everything you need from Walmart (decorating tips, bags, accessories, cake pans) in the wedding aisle--much cheaper than cake supply store.Cake was a hit and I was able to serve vegan/organic cake but boy was it a lot of work. The kit requires that you buy quite a lot more than what's included in order for the cake to be made."
2,out of print? Is the theater really dead?,"This book is nothing but the ""Bible"". Parker Smith (Wolf?) and Burris-Meyer & Cole is the staff of the scenery education. Packed full of pertinent and necessary information. After 25 years of building scenery this is still one of my foremost resources. Unlike Parker Smith which also covers lighting design and as such, older editions can be outdated due to changes in basic technology, Burris-Meyer & Cole is a timeless reference book dealing hands on with techniques that have been and will be around for a long time. If you haven't a copy of this and intend to be a serious scenery professional find a copy."
1,Did not last,After using it once a week for three months the motor burnt out. Won't even go through the trouble of trying to get a replacement from the makers.
2,I used it for a year,"I bought one of these LED Christmas trees for my computer at work. The tree has been plugged into my computer since last Christmas and runs 5 days a week, all day. It has stood up quite well to the use although recently one of the LED colours has died and I am here to get another one. I accept the fact that the LEDs don't last forever and I do not see this as a manufacturing fault, just a fact of life. It is a fun and festive way to brighten an office."
2,A wonderful sequel,"I thought this sequel to Dark Fall was even more fun than the first game. This is a point-and-click slide-show type haunted lighthouse adventure game. Again, there are no characters other than occasional voices. Also again, it doesn't have any whiz-bang graphics, but the illustrations are effective, the atmosphere is moody, and the puzzles are complex and interesting. I really enjoyed this one because of some unexpected, clever turns in the story. The only complaint I have is that the game just ends abruptly. Even more highly recommended than the first game. (If you can get the Pins & Needles edition that contains both Dark Fall and Lights Out it's well worth it.) After you play this one, play The Lost Crown."
2,Any body who has met a evil person has to believe in demons!,"This is an excellent book on truths that needs to be paid attention to that there are evil spirits out there and we should not pretend they don't exist! Just because this psychologist adds his religious beliefs to his practice does not mean he's suddenly a quake but means hes smart enough to know truth when he sees it.People aren't the only ones who can be evil any spirit can be as well.Demons exist there are many non christian religions talk of them, and even psychics."
2,stunning,"the beauty and darkness of this cd blew me away. a must for all who like dark, heavy, and tragic music."
1,Growing up and giving in,"Mest is one of my favorite bands, in fact, the more I think about it, they are my favorite band. They've been with me for years, so please believe me when I say that I'm cutting them as much slack as one can in this review.Why is it that when bands ""grow up"", they appeal to the younger audience of teenie boppers? It seems that the longer a band is around, the poppier their sound becomes. It happened with Green Day, it happened with Blink 182, and now it's happening to Mest.Photographs was a disappointment to me. If you're a real fan, pretend this CD never came out. It will upset you. This isn't the Mest we know and love. Sure, the CD would be wonderful if it was someone else, but when you have all the previous CDs, Photographs is nothing in comparison.However, if you're new to Mest, and if you're thirteen or fourteen, go ahead. Knock yourselves out."
2,"Great results, bad smell!","Buy the Tropical. The original smells terrible, the tropical smells much better and does the same thing. Overall, Batiste is a great product, it makes my greasy hair look fresh and clean!"
1,Not very unique in my experience,"Kind of a combination of Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula. I was so not ready for the ending I kept turning the page, like what happened. It just ends, that's it? I didn't like it at all, although I will say at times I found it disturbing. Short story material, not a novel."
2,"Good Movie, more action than thriller.","I enjoyed this movie. I thought both actors did a terrific job. It's not a long movie by other movie standards, but long enough.Perfect if you have nothing to do on a rainy saturday.If you enjoy this movie, try Flighplan"
2,"Not Bose, But Great For The Price","I've used these primarily on airliners. They are great for the money and worth buying.Pros: A clear value and comfortable enough for a couple of hours wear at a time.Cons: A little bulky compared to Bose QC3 and the headphone bag doesn't offer any protection. Not as quiet as Bose QC2.Don't let the comparisons with Bose discourage you. If you have a few hundred dollars to spend on headphones and you use them all the time, go with Bose. If you want something less than $75, these are a good choice. Just find one of the semi-ridged Bose cases to store them in."
1,"Awful, except for one hilarious mistake.","Hisss was incredibly bad, as I expected. Forced to say one good thing about the movie, I would note that the lead actress is physically stunning. The CGI barely rose to the level of last-generation video games. The only thing that kept me watching is the fact that (for the DVD) the English subtitles (I have a hearing deficit) were for a DIFFERENT MOVIE. In fact, for one of the movies that was advertised in a trailer before the feature. The pairing--or juxtaposition--of the images in ""Hisss"" and the dialog from the other movie made for some very funny moments. If it hadn't been for that stupid mistake on the part of the DVD producer, ""Hisss"" would have been truly unwatchable. So perhaps it was intentional after all."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"I don't know why people are saying this film is fantastic. It is complete rubbish, unless you think an eyeball piercing scene is worth 20 pounds sterling. For a start the FX are poor: the spiders look like pipe cleaners (I laughed out loud when I saw them), the zombies AREN'T day of the dead quality (hardly any gore) and the whole plot is just rubbish with super-bad acting. IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A FILM ALONG THE LINE OF THE ROMERO ""DEAD"" MOVIES, YOU WILL BE SORELY DISAPPOINTED. I gave this movie away a week after I bought it, yes it is that bad."
2,Good Product,"This is a good protein to start a good base for all protein shakes. Using the Vanilla Custard flavor, you can add other flavors to your shake by using fruits, veggies or sugar-free instant pudding."
2,well,"Good book about rejection. God made all of us to need love. When rejected, we have a hard time forgiving and letting go. God is the only one who will not reject you. He loves us with an unfailing Love."
2,No second chance - Harlan Coben,Once agasin his books are great. You want to keep reading and not putting the book down until you are at the end. You just don't know who the bad guys are until the end and the interesting thing is at the end the whole story makes sense ! He's GREAT.
2,Works great!!,"I bought a couple of these for gifts and myself and they work great. Easy to clean. You have to be careful taking them apart, but it is not too hard. The ones I got were ""National"" brand, the Japanese brand of Panasonic. Same product."
1,Not what we were hoping for at all,"The ""board"" is thin and simply unrolls. It retains the rolled shape for a long time and was really cheaply made. We ended up having to replace it with a different board. Not impressed."
1,Howard the Dud,"Well I can honestly say that I have enjoyed some cheesy bizarre movies the kind that are so bad that they are funny but Howard the Duck was simply just bad and bizarre but not funny at all and though I don't always agree with the professional critics I'm in complete agreement with them that this is one of the worst movie ever made and truly is the worst thing that came out in the 80's. I like Tim Robbins, Jeffrey Jones and Leah Thompson but this movie is so beneath them! I love George Lucas but WHAT WAS HE THINKING!!!!!!!"
2,The Ultimate In Word Play,"Smooth Da Hustler and his brother Trigga da gambla bring an unusual but uncanny styler of wich is one of a kind. This CD is hot and should be put back on shelves. You can hear snippets from this CD on the current HBO hit THE CORNER. Released in 1996 although I think it was a lil earlier than that, the Album is HOT!"
1,Nightmare !!!,Careful!!! IF you are looking for a pure music and video clips to check your latest dolby HT - this will be a nightmare for you. This CD is simply gives wizzzing sound through which you can check all the channels. It wont be helpful if you are using dolby digital. It is good only for old dolby pro logic systems. If you are having DTS decoded etc... this CD will be an expensive toy.Give another thought beofore you buy... Best suggestion would be DTS / Dolby Digital Demo CDs
1,"cheap, too many problems","bought this mp3 player 5 years ago, it used its own usb cable instead of mini-usb, had an internal battery/memory so it was unable to be updated . it uses a software called ""itunes"" Meaning you have to install that bulky software to do anything with this mp3 device. when i bought it was over 400 dollars. by 13 months of little use, the battery stopped holding charge, i called apple, the company that makes this device, they said theres nothing they can do, as the battery is designed only to last within the warranty period. wasted 400 dollars, better off donating that moneymy 11 year old diamond mp3 player had more options and was better built.do not buy apple products!!i rated poor ease of use because you have to use itunes"
2,Excellent Supplement!,"I highly recommend this book to help supplement your Contracts readings. I know that I personally have trouble reading through the cases in my contracts book because sometimes the facts can be so uninteresting or very confusing. I like to read the case summary in this book first and then read through the case so that I at least have a general idea of what the case is about. It helps me focus on the main ideas of the case. Of coure the book also helps out if you haven't kept up with your reading and need a quick way to go over a long case. But don't depend on this book for that alone. Always refer back to your original case book because this case summary is just that, a summary. There are some essential facts that are left out that are helpful."
2,Powerful Celtic Sound,"The suite is a moving expression of a Pilgrim's journey, and a powerful evocation of a Celtic spirit. The orchestra, choirs, and pipe bands are all excellent, as are the soloists. This CD is a must for anyone who enjoys the Relief of Derry Symphony, also by Shaun Davey, anyone who enjoys the music of Riverdance, or anyone who enjoys rich classical music."
1,too much useless information,"This book has tons of information in it if you are writing a detailed report on the background, history and subtypes of bettas. It has a great deal about wild bettas and types of bettas. It wasn't until over half-way through the book that it actually told me information on keeping the betta splenden as a pet, and then it went back to the history lesson again.The information that he provided about food types for Bettas was the most helpful part in the whole book."
2,Auel Review Earths Childres,Its hard to believe I started reading this in the 80's. I heard recently that Auel is planning to release the next in the series this year. That said I wanted to revist Earths Children. I ordered this book and was DELIGHTED to get a hardcover with dust jacket in very good condition. Altho used it would have cost me 3x's more if I would have bought it new. THANKS Amazon and bookseller!!!
1,Terrible!!,"This is the worst book on Stanford that I have ever seen. The pictures are small and faded . . . I have photos taken in 1975 with a cheap camera that look better than what you'll find here. (Ah, but the cover pic looks awfully nice, you might think. Yes, it does. Fine bit of hucksterism from Princeton Architectural Press.)"
2,George Canyon - One True Friend,"All I can say is WOW! This album is a gift, containing very personal, heart felt, musically fabulous music. I saw George Canyon on Nashville Star and think the only reason hd did not win was because so many of his fans are in Canada. He has a fantastic voice and this is already one of the best albums in my collection. Don't miss this - there is some refreshingly different, some classic country music to bring a tear to your eye."
2,Good Product,My hamster seemed to be more comfortable in a bigger wheel like this one. Definitely need to check for any chips or cracks after shipping so they don't cut their feet.
2,A Great deal for the money,I just received my router and I am very pleased with it. I have never owned a plunge and so the weight took some getting used to. When I was shopping for a plunge router all the other 3.25HP routers were selling for about ... more the the Freud and since I would Freud router bits and the reviews at the time were positive I went for it. Amazon was offering a $15 coupon and a free edge guide at the time. So I paid a little of ...I believe. Nice going Amazon and the router is great.
1,Shettles' method is pseudoscience,"One of the basis of the scientific method is the reproducibility of the results. Dr Shettles is the only one who has performed positive studies of is method. In fact, scientific evidences show the opposite of Dr Shettles' claims, that is to say ""the timing of sexual intercourse in relation to ovulation has no bearing on the sex of the baby""1.This book is one among millions showing how human beings are gullible and can believe almost anything, especially when it sounds scientific.1. Wilcox, A. J., C. R. Weinberg, et al. (1995). ""Timing of sexual intercourse in relation to ovulation. Effects on the probability of conception, survival of the pregnancy, and sex of the baby."" N Engl J Med 333(23): 1517-21."
2,The Very Best of Ann Margret,I love the sultry way she sings. She is so cute. Some of the songs I had never heard before.
2,Good but not great,"Most of the characters were annoying in this book. I do like how each one got a chance to tell ""their"" side of the story.Not one of her best but still made for a pleasent read."
1,disappointed,"I've been waiting for this release, as I really liked her first two releases - but am glad I borrowed it first. I tried to give it a chance but didn't really care for most of the songs - a major change from her first two cd's - too commercial - should sell well with the pre-teen market - those who's parents don't screen the lyrics first"
2,Great stories to share with your grandkids,"I started by buying these books for my parents to fill out for me. I loved reading their responses. I learned many things about my parents that I didn't know before. It also sparked conversations with them about additional stories.Now that I have children, I'm buying these books for me and (the grandparent ones) for my parents to fill out for them. And buying them as gifts for new parents.Regarding the comments that there isn't a lot of room to write...The pages are small, but there are only a few pages that you would get that lengthy on your stories. You can always attach in an additional sheet of paper to continue your story."
2,pretty experienced just a few words about ON,"Optimum Nutrition has great products in my opinion, not just taste but quality. Having had access to trainers from around the world, many different regimes ect this product is one of the best proteins I've used. Only a couple of things with this product for me are, if you mix it with water it seems pretty thin. Not saying that's bad, and it still has good taste with water. Just don't expect it to blunt hunger for any amount of time. If you're eating right, it won't matter anyway. Mixes well with creatine, cost is great comparably and I will buy it again. My opinion is that some of the other proteins add fillers, and say it has a lot of other ingredients to make it more appealing and ON doesn't do that. If you want straight up protein that taste great, low fat, low carbs, then you will be happy with this purchase. If you're chasing more of the all in one product, this isn't your bag then."
1,Looks Great! But Watch Out...,"Wheels MUST be compatible with your sound and video cards or they won't work right. My installed sound card was not compatible, and tech support told me ""its not ever going to work with that sound card."" (C-media was the sound card manufacturer.) I then bought what tech support recommended (any Sound Blaster), so I bought SB X-Gamer. Now the wheel works for about ONE lap of one race, in ""Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit"". The wheel eventually stops responding, and your car spins in a left-hand turn, or crashes. (I do enough crashing on my own, and don't need the help.) If all you want to do is look at it, this is a terrific wheel. But if you plan to use it, be prepared that you might have to replace half the components in your computer with expensive, name-brand stuff, to make it work."
1,Not as good as all the hype,"I was expecting a movie that I would be laughing my [behind] off at. This movie isnt that. I did laugh a few times but after a while it got boring. Will Ferrell wasnt funny enough. Most of National Lampoon's movies are better then this, and this isnt a new ""Animal House"""
2,Good.,"A worst legal story. Compared to Michell McDeere in the Firm and Mike in the Street Lawyer, this is Grisham's worst novel"
2,Great quality,"Easily the best of Reel Big Fish's DVDs to date, this one features better audio quality than even their previous live album. A good sampling of the Reel Big Fish catalog, from Turn the Radio Off to Fame, Fortune, and Fornication. I would have liked some more material from We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy, but overall am very pleased."
1,not that entertaining,This item is fairly boring and not entertaining at all. It's also hard to operate. In order for the king and queen to play the music you have to hit them really hard. On top of that you can barely hear the music. Not worth all the money.
2,Simply awesome!,"Very surprised that this book is not reviewed much. Has great case-based questions for a majority of the tested topics with detailed and valuable answers that help to distinguish between even the most apparently similar diagnosis. It is question and answer based USMLE Step 2 review at its very best. Because of this book, I passed Step 2 after an initial unsuccessful try using other really dry, boring review books that just took up space on my bookshelf. Keep it simple, this book is all you need for Step 2. Thanks a bunch to Dr. Alario and the whole cast for having written such an exceptional review book."
2,travel map of Colombia,I have plan to have business trip to Bogota in Colombia in a few day. please give me information in order to understand easily Colombia.
2,WILD PALMS Is A One-Of-A-Kind 6 Hour Mini-Series WELL REMEMBERED,"WILD PALMS Is A One-Of-A-Kind Very Scary 6 Hour Science Fiction Mini-Series Ahead Of Its Time. It Is WELL REMEMBERED By Me For The Great Soundtrack And All Star Cast Including Myself As An Extra Actor In Which I Fortunately Got To Appear Within The First 25 Minutes. (I am in the House Party Scene 3x's). The DP Used Me In A Steadicam Shot As A Pivoting Point Between The Main Characters. I remember Spending The Day At That Modern House In Woodland Hills, California Hanging Out Between Takes And Eating Lunch With Ernie Hudson Who Is Very Funny In Real Life And James Belushi Who Wasn't Talking That Day As He Was Concentrating Deeply On His Role. [...]"
2,Indispensible,"This book, along with the ""Mathematical Handbook"" by M.Vygodsky (translated from Russian -- appears to be unavailable in the US) have been my staple reference books for much of the math that I learned during my undergrad education."
1,Absolutely useless lock in NY...and any larger city,"I had higher expectations for this lock. It seemed sturdy enough, certainly formidable looking and not one I would think could be easily broken. The company touts it's credits without hesitation. Well, I went into a store yesterday and within less than 5 minutes I came out to see a thief making off with my bike that had been responsibly locked with an Evolution Series 4 lock from Kryptonite. Just curious, I checked youtube this morning to see if there were any videos about this lock and there were plenty. It's incredibly easy to pick the lock...in seconds!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,"5 STARS TIMES 1,000","I have been a fan of Outkast since SOUTHERNPLAYALISTICADILLACMUSIC put the ""dawty south"" on the map. This double album takes me back to the smell of mary-jane in the dungeon. Andre3000 could easily take the place of the Neptunes as the greatest producer and Big Boi should start a school along with Mos Def teaching these 50 cent worth a busta's how to put substance in their lyrics. Other than that .. no words can describe how good this is."
2,A young girl's struggles in the 1960s,"Livey 2 (named after her late sister whom she talks and prays to) struggles through life in North Carolina during the 1960's. She has lots of sisters and not much food for the whole family, so she's constantly hungry. But the biggest problem of all is that her younger sister, Gentle, is blind. This story about a musician, (Livey 2 plays the guitar), is not as sad as it sounds. It uses no bad language and is child appropriate. I thought the characters were realistic and the plot was very interesting."
1,"Giant, heavy pile of dog doo doo with flimsy tape","A gadget would be putting it nicely. My mother got this for all of us on father's day. I guffawed to myself when I saw it but sadly, did not immediately return it to the store for credit and get something good. It is so heavy and big, its unwieldy. The tape is so flimsy that overhead one hand use is impossible. All in all a gimmick that fails badly. It will be one of the worst sawbucks you have ever spent."
2,"Very practical, useful and complete book!","This book is quite practical. I have been looking through different books on negotiation and this one seems very complete and not focus one specific tactic to negotiate.It makes you aware of the different tactics used in negotiation and how to counter-attack them. Some books only focus on attack. The examples are quite easy to understand and are based on daily life negotiation (car, house and so on...). To that you have some useful exercices that you can practice by yourself or with a partner. Recommended!"
2,Pure escapism--perfect late night viewing.,"Perfect videos for late-nite viewing, especially if you want to recreate those great weekend nights when we were younger and escape for a few hours. Feel free to critique the films outloud! Nobody will care. Just enough drama, tension, and action (not to mention ""production values"") to keep you interested. Add a beer and a pizza and someone special--don't know if it actually does get any better than this!"
1,Anywhere but Here,I too am suffering through it because I can't not finish it -- I keep waiting to get to the plot of the story. There's too much flashbacking and time swapping going on throughout the story that you're not sure who's telling the story and during which time frame. I may see the movie just to end the torture of reading the book to find out how it ends.
1,Wrong size though search for right size brings it up,"I've ordered Empire batteries before and did a search for phone battery 3301. This one came up and I ordered. The ones I received don't match the picture and are not the right size. I was surprised as I got them before and they were the right size as pictured. When you look at what is written after having it come up in the search for the right size, there is little information and size isn't specified making it difficult to know you will get the wrong size. I will order a different brand next time which is too bad as the Empire batteries lasted longer than Lenmar and AT&T."
1,Disappointing,"After reading an up to date version of Larrian Gilespie,MD You Don't Have to Live with Cystitis, I find this cookbook not up to date(10 years old). I am wheat intolerant and dairy intolerant as well am so many recipes are based on these two ingredients.There are many recipes with nuts as well which Larrian says IC people are not tolerant of so it is not of much use to me."
1,Rudder pedals,"Pedals at wrong angle, should be more straight up. If you put them on carpet they slide around all over the place. Waste of money."
2,"New equipment, new kits, new rules (optional)","No longer a character class just limited to stealing and running. This book has a kit for all situations. New equipment, new items, and ideas for guilds, a nice spin on 1 of the basic 4 classes."
1,Planetary? Yes. Romance? No.,"This novel was very disappointing. The author showed some creativity with respect to the world of Paragaea, but in most other respects the work was unsatisfactory. The characters were wooden, the prose uninspired. I see that the publisher compares this work to that of Burroughs and Brackett, but those authors (in addition to creating exotic planetary scenery) could TELL A GOOD STORY. Here, I guarantee most readers will lose interest in these characters about halfway through the story. That's just as well because ultimately the author leaves most of these largely unsympathetic characters into dead ends, and unresolved or unconvincing conclusions."
2,MID-EVIL DEAD !,"This is Sam Raimi & Bruce Campbell's full on over the top action packed horror comedy ""ARMY OF DARKNESS"". Loaded with groundbreaking special efx(for the time),plenty of red stuff & more ASH *one liners* then we can handle! A.O.D. is a very fun super slapstick cult classic & this 2 disc boomstick S.E. containing both the U.S. ""THEATRE RELEASE"" & the ""DIRECTOR'S CUT"" is in my opinion the version to have!"
1,Worse than anything before it.,"This is the story where Austen really shows us what he can do. It seems as if he made it this bad on purpose.Essentially, his point is that groups that mutate similarly have to stick together for some reason. And he illustrates this point with a group that has no personality whatsoever. Aside from Maximus Lobo, not one of them says anything that they aren't just repeating.And as if it isn't bad enough, there's Kia Asamiya redesigning the costumes. It's like being stabbed immediately after someone shoots you in the lung.These costumes are bizarre. Lorna's has two sets of black wings (one on her head). Archangel's has a red loincloth.If a copy falls from the sky, I still say that you should set it on fire immediately, and be glad.Or, simply put: DO NOT READ."
1,"""Where's the elephants""","""Where's the elephants"", this is what my two year old daughter said throughout the tape. If you want to see a ""Goldie-fest"" as my wife called it, buy this tape. If you want to see elephants, and keep your young children interested, find something else."
1,Low quality,"Bought for my husband, but after only several laundries it took very unattractive appearance. It was not the only hoodie of my husband, so he had not beed wearing it 24 hour a day, 7 per week:)). But for working to site it is ok. But I'll not buy it again"
1,Extra Wide description false,"I'm a 62 year old male, 6' tall, weighing 250lbs. Just had my right hip replaced and am swollen. I purchased this seat based on the ""Extra-Wide"" in the product name. In reality it is not any wider than a seat I already had w/o support legs, that cost half as much. I can not sit comfortably on the seat. my hips press against the arms on both sides, and since my stitches are there, it's painful. Also due to tight space, I'm unable to get another body part down between my legs. Construction and ease of assembly are good, size is my complaint."
2,The blue is back and better than ever.,"If you're going to buy the Sega Dreamcast this season, Sonic Adventure is a must-buy for the system. Stunning worlds and innovative play make Sonic Adventure an exciting, breathless,andvisually astounding game. As Sonic, Tails, Knuckes, Amy, Big, andE102 Gamma, each character must stop the evil that threatens, an evil which lies in Dr. Robotnik -- the sinister villain who has returned to unlease ultimate destruction. Areas like Emerald Coast, Speed Highway, and the Sky Deck make you feel like you're flying in the game, an insane speed that grips and doesn't let go. Breathtaking graphics and sound make this a top-quality game, and no Sonic fan should miss out on Sonic Adventure. A masterpiece of a game, Sonic Adventure is one wild ride, and the Dreamcast shouldn't go without this title. The Dreamcast has accomplished much with this title, and if you're playing Sonic Adventure, don't let go of the controller : this is a fast game.It is must-buy for all gamers."
1,Same problem -- cracking down middle,"As another reviewer mentioned, after about one year of use (although... I don't think I got quite that much) this footrest started to crack down the middle. Before that, it seemed fine... worked well. But, I am honestly surprised that the manufacturer couldn't find a way to reinforce the plastic better -- huge design flaw IMO."
1,worst movie ever. It had no point. I was highly disappointed.,terrible movie. It made no sense whatsoever. I hated that I paid $3.00 to rent it. Boo on amazon. There was no plot and nothing contiguous about the story line. In a word: Terrible.
1,It doesn't even play with Sony DVD players!,"What a disappointment! I've read about the warning of the devices before I purchased this DVD, however, it doesn't even play on TWO different Sony DVD players! Both of them are ""play-only"" devices and new models! It took a long time to ""load"" the dvd, and after the spinning stopped, no image, nothing happened! It is just not playable! If Amazon/CreateSpace has the technology to produce such a product and sale it in top price, why don't they produce something user-friendly? Instead, we paid almost $20 for ONE useless dvd, got super disappointed and have to go through the hassle of return/refund! What a waste of time!"
2,"lingerie secrets, but not compleet","This is a beautiful book, with lots of pictures, including fitting advice. Some patterns are drafted from body measurements, and those can fit everyone. But others are only available in 4 or 5 different sizes, to be copied (and enlarged) from the book. Only one model of bra is included, and that is not a very supportive model, so not suitable for fuller figures. The book give many ideas for night wear and lounge wear, using both woven and knitted fabrics. Both design/drafting and sewing tips are included."
1,Good production,I like the original novel. The story is better than US movie. But this was made 30 years ago. Sorry it is old.
1,BEWARE - you need to buy the CD separately,"I ordered this book and of course, paid the postage to get it here. Now - I find out that half the course is missing. In order to really utilize this book the way it was written - you need the manual and CD. They send you a nice letter saying the price is only $8.50. DUH!!! It would be nice to know this ahead of time when you're purchasing the book. I felt ""ripped off"" before I even used this course."
2,"""Lock S-Foils in attack position!""","If you remotely like video games, and Star Wars, then you must own this game! Even the training mission on Tatooine is damn cool...the Death Star attack(the first real mission), will have any true Star Wars fan feeling like they're really in the movie. Cool details, like controlling your squadron formation, and the targeting computer add to the whole experience, with real voices of Wedge too...awesome game overall."
2,Classic book on shock waves,"Title self-explanatory. This is a standard reference for all of shock wave theory. Many of the mathematical methods in the book are now obsolete. i.e. We do things computationally now. Still worth having on your book shelf. Excellent coverage of characteristic rays. I have made ""powerpoint"" presentations based on the material in this book, so it must be worth something."
2,Would be far better with LED bulb,"About 1.5x brighter than the 2D halogen maglite. The 3D LED maglite is way brighter than either though. Would like to get a bulb replacement for this one.Battery life is only 11 hours? Since it's not a whole lot brighter than the 2D cell I was surprised by the short battery life.If you're not a security guard you'll look like one carrying this flashlight / baton. It's huge, which is probably the reason why you're buying it."
2,Great Book for Health Conscious,"This is a very helpful book for anyone interested in health, feeling great, or looking great. I actually found the diet recommendations more helpful than any other book I've read on health. The 28-day program menus are not particularly practical, but together with the information in the text, they helped me formulate a diet that has worked to help me feel great all the time, slim down, and stay that way."
2,A classic but not the best,This album is a great album but its not AZs best. If this was any other rapper this would be the album that they would be remembered by. The best song on this album is How Ya Livin feat Nas. This is probably the best AZ song of all time.
2,"For non-fiction travelogue fans, I'd say watch it.","I enjoyed the message well enough, I was glad that both main characters are doing so much better, and found it kinda inspiring. :)The film has pacing issues (I got out-right bored in the first half), and doesn't provide any indication at the outset that it's disjointed (not one unified narrative, but two correlated stories). Know that ahead of time and you'll enjoy things that much more."
1,no Battery,We installed the eatery it worked for a few days whit one hour charge. Then after a couple of weeks the iPod stopped working. I don't know if is an apple thing or the battery is not good. But the fix did not work at all.
1,A weak Police Novel!,"""Exceptional Clearence"" is a book with no outstandings qualities. There's no great detective work or a gripping and interesting mystery to solve. The characters are poorly developed and I remember Ed Mc Bain's 87 Precint novels as a good example of how to built a convincing and weel structured police novel. Caunitz has too much to learn in this way before reaches a respectable position among the great police writers, like Mc Bain, Chandler and others."
1,Don't bother,"Couldn't last past 1st chapter! Found it ditzy,, no real story. If a novel hasn't got me in during the first few pages, it's not worth it. This was one such novel. Unimpressed. Won't be searching out this authors work."
2,AWESOME!!!,HSAS's only album. They broke up as Sammy Hagar joined Van Halen and Neil Schon regrouped Journey for the Raised on Radio album. The album is live with a lot of overdubbing in the studio. The result is absolute pure unadultrated rock n' roll. Sammy's vocals are some of the most powerful he ever recorded and Schon cuts loose on the guitar more than he ever did on a Journey album. I waited for this album to come out on cd for many years. Well it's out and is well worth the price.
1,HodgePodge is a Flop and Waste of Money,"There should be a ZERO Star Rating!We ordered three bags of hodgepodge hoping to get at least some variety in flavors with that many bags. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. Almost everything was yellow or green -- our two least favorite flavors! There were several differently-shaped items, but almost everything was lemon or lime. Of course, that's the risk you run, according to the description.To Jelly Belly Management -- What a great way to alienate your loyal customers.To Jelly Belly Customers -- Caveat emptor (""Let the buyer beware."")Bottom line, HodgePodge is a waste of money."
1,Broke immediately!,"I loaded the batteries, and turned the base to start it. The base came off in my hand, and gave me an electrical shock. It was after the 10 days Amazon gives you to return things, so I threw it away. Total waste of money!"
1,Worst textbook I've ever purchased and been required to read,Plan to have a supplemental textbook for reference [I actually used 2 supplements]. This is the worst textbook I've ever been required to read. The authors supply more historical information than practical theoretical relations.
2,Well worth having in your library,This is an excellent how to book for both beginners and intermediate usersof Macintosh OSx Tiger. It covers most of the required information in aneasy to understand and use fashion. Explanations are detailed enough to getthe job done without being too technically heavy.It would be very suitable as well for anyone switching from using WindowsAll things considerwed this book is a good investment and a good way to getinto using OSx Tiger.to using OSx.
2,Party Pack for a 1 Year Old's birthday,"My husband is a huge Steelers fan, so when our daughter turned one, I picked a day for her birthday party. Since we don't have many friends with kids, I just picked a random day in Jan. 2011. Well the day I picked was a major Steelers game. So we couldn't miss the game now could we. So my husband said that we can have a Steelers/1 Year Old birthday party. I ordered this as a suprise to my husband. The price was higher then I wanted to pay, but it made my husband happy. My daughter is a Steelers fan as well. She knows the logo so she was happy as well."
2,Great business case,"I am a professional sales person and wanted a backpack style case. Did not want to look like a college kid, if you know what I mean. I'm 45 and am no longer ""cool"" lol. I'm also an Apple Mac guy, so it's really hard to carry this Microsoft logo around, BUT it's well worth it. Everything has it""s place, fits great, carrys great and looks good. Only complaint is the big flap gets annoying. It covers all the non-laptop areas. Super easy to get your laptop out, but pain to get at notebook etc. But again, not a big deal."
1,Papa Review,The best thing I liked about this movie was the lead actress's clothes and the cute children. The storyline just did not do it for me. I was disappointed. Sorry.
1,Recycled Gossip,"I did not like this book. The only positive thing I can say abou ""The Maintenance Man"" is that it is a quick read, I read it in 3 1/2 hours. The story felt like receyled gossip. I got the feeling that the drama in the book came from incidents that Mr. Baisden had heard second hand. The charcters were flat and un-developed. I would have like to have learned more about Antoinette besides the fact that she was a dancer. And the most unrealistic character of all was ""Lawrence"". I think Martin Lawrence does a joke in his movie ""You So Crazy"" about a crazy boyfriend that goes to the club in his pajamas to get his girlfriend. Martin's joke was funnier and more believeable. I hate to say this but I don't think I'll read anymore books by Michael Baisden. He just doesn't have the same gift for writing like Eric Jerome Dickey, and E. Lynn Harris."
2,As Good As Any,"I bought the Sanyo 200 in knowing it had no top. When I realized I needed one I snapped this puppy up at a short-lived $45. Who needs an indoor grill that splatters? I may as well use the grill plate that covers 2 burners (now relegated to an outdoor 2-burner gas stove and a 2-burner electric plate used on the patio). Cooking for one most of the time the smaller grilling space wasn't an issue. But keeping the food covered with a see-thru top is, tho this one isn't a tight fit and must be carefully placed. But buying a heat-keeping aluminum baking pan to cover the Sanyo would've been cost-prohibitive. Plus the flat edge is handy for non-meat foods. No smoke, little odor, easy enough to clean- so what's not to like? Yeah, well it takes up space & I can't park stuff on it when not in use like the Sanyo, but so what? The Sanyo I'll give away."
2,"Beautiful storytelling, captivating read","See comment to review of ""camisdad"" above -as someone who first read this book as a child, and a passionate lover of Greek mythology, I highly recommend it."
2,What a book...,I like this book. It has a lot in it. The recipes are a little on the long side. The food is good. Most of the ingredients are easy to find. I like to use it for holidays and special meals a lot. To me German foods says Christmas.
2,awesome movie,Cherry 2000 is a beautiful movie about love.....and sex robots. a post apocalyptic action romance with Melanie Griffith and a cameo by Lawrence Fishburne
2,Love curious George!,"This is our second time ""renting"" this movie. It is so great and my son absolutely loves curious george! We should just buy it:)"
2,Essential Vonnegut Interviews CD,"It seems to me that Kurt Vonnegut's work is growing in popularity, and this CD allows us a peek at his point of view in writing some of it."
2,Stylish and comfortable,"This stylish and comfortable pillow is great for travelling. The foam holds it shape and provides the support you need. It is long and that makes it hard to carry around if you don't have a larger carry-on bag, but it's worth it to have the comfort it provides."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed by this book. There were very few photos (16 pages of photos for 120+ recipes). I expected higher class recipes from a restaurant (less use of canned Pillsbury biscuits, brownie and cake mixes, jarred ice cream topping, frozen whipped topping, and saltines). And way too many recipes call for coconut (with no note of possible substitutions or omissions).I bought this book for my mom. I hope she likes it more than I did."
2,Touching and Beautiful,"I laughed, I cried, but most of all I didn't want this book to end. I have read many books by Elizabeth Berg before and she has yet to dissapoint me.This book is about 51 year old nurse Myra Lipinsky, who has never married and her dog Frank is the only family she has. She is truly dedicated to her career and her patients and she has made a comfortable living for herself. The one problem is she suffers from loneliness and she dreams of having a real family.That all changes when she is assigned a new patient Chip Reardon, who happens to be an old high school friend that she had a crush on and he is dying. He teaches Myra how to open up and except love and he also shows her how much she means to the people in her life.This was a very beautiful love story and I thought it was well written. I highly recommend reading this book or any other book by Ms. Berg."
2,OUCH! very hot!,"Ok, this was filmed on locations around Key West, on the street and both inside and outside of clubs...a video like the other ones advertised on late night tv. Lots of brief shots, some if you blink you will miss! BUT, the cute babes featured on the cover show everything in between the location shots AND you get to see Tanya James...be careful, both this cutey and the two on the cover are extra HOT!"
2,Crusaders rejoice... Wardens cowar! LOL,"An excellent Field Manual, loaded with sourcebook-class information on the following Clans:Blood Spirit, Fire Mandrill, Hell's Horses, Ice Hellion, Jade Falcon, Star Adder, WolfPlus, a relatively full section showing the statistics of the units of every Clan.The Clan's new Gnome and Salamander suits are shown here, along with the new Heavy Lasers, the Blood Kite 'Mech, the Hellfire 'Mech and the Hellion OmniMech.The only beef I have with it is it has that useless section in the back on making scenarios."
1,Its not worth 1 star,"I told myself after Winter's Heart I would stop reading thisseries.Why didn't I listen to myself!!!The first books in the series were sooo good, I keep thinking Robert Jordan will go back to the way he use to write.But now I know he's looking to drag this out to book 100. Some part of me is starting to think Robert Jordan is no longer writing these books,that maybe he sold it to some newbie writer off the street.I don't know, and I don't care anymore.Well, let my mistake be your good fortune. Save your money.If you are looking for a great fantasy book, type in a searchfor George R.R. Martin. His books could be called too good."
2,Good Buy,I'm glad I bought this dog bed. The minute I took it out of the box my dogs literally tried to lie down on it.The only problem is that it flattens in about three weeks. Still my dogs love it.
1,historical twaddle.,"a badly written load of tripe. a tangled mess of names, places, gushing, florid prose that i have wasted money on. don't do the same."
2,the secret is hardly what you think it is,"This adaptation of a Japanese film was completely not what I expected - it's more a psychological thriller, a different, more intelligent take on the Freaky Friday motif. It brings up many moral and ethical issues that might arise with psychological disorders and traumas. Olivia Thirlby is brilliant and extremely effective in her first role in this film. David Duchovny has a few great moments and in the beginning of the film looks so young, it makes one reminisce the first years of The X-Files. Additionally, the soundtrack is very appropriate and very melodic."
1,Excitement over Maiden DVD turns to disappointment...,"I wasn't really a fan of this show even when it was on VHS - the fake studio setting just never seemed right. And the song selection is debatable, although there are some good surprises (""Transylvania"", f'rinstance). Anyway, I figured I had to get the DVD just because it would be cool to have a Maiden DVD. Not a great move, it turns out.The one positive thing I can say is that the picture quality is impressive. This thing looks cool. But then you have to listen to it, and it falls apart. Whoever did the mix should be embarassed. This was the first concert in 5.1 that I've purchased, and it about turned me off to any future purchases. Horrible, muddy sound with Bruce's vocals buried waaaayyy back. The stereo mix is fair. But why buy a DVD to have a regular stereo mix? Well, it gets two stars just because it's Iron Maiden, but this release doesn't deserve to have the Maiden name on it."
1,Danger! Danger!,"Boring crap. The interaction between Heather Graham and whatshisface was probably the most painful part. If my friend hadn't insisted we stay, I would have left half way through."
1,"Interesting cases, not well written","While the cases referenced in this book are interesting cases to study, reading each case was difficult because much of the information is repeated and extraneous information is added. The book could be condensed to 25% of its size easily with a big red pencil."
2,Suspense and suprise ending,I like SI FY and this was right up my alley! Keeps your interest throughout the move with a suprise ending!
2,I did not get a piece of cake...,TheOffice Space - Special Edition with Flair (Widescreen Edition)fan in your place of employment will be brought to tears by this excellence and function stapling device. In addition you have the fun of attempting to steal it back. I highly reccomend it.
1,Solaris,"I enjoy all types of Sci Fi, and this is an old story. Maybe because I read the book but I enjoyed the book much more than this move. I was falling asleep......"
1,Ugh! Pretentious silly nonsense,"I read a lot of literature, of many different varieties, and judge this book to be in that same self-important class of deconstructionist **** that includes Endgame by Thomas a Beckett. I bought this on a whim as an audiobook on CD, and found the general stream-of-consciousness and lack of plot so mind numbing it almost put me to sleep at the wheel. If it wasn't for my overall irritation at having wasted money on the purchase keeping me awake, I probably would have plowed into another car. This is an awful, plotless, plodding horror."
2,The Hebrew Language,"After listening to many of ""The A.D. Chronicles"" I thought it would be interesting to learn about the Hebrew Language and it's use in the Bible. After perusing the first of many books and workbooks, I discovered that learning Hebrew should start at the ripe ole age of 3 or 4 ... not for one in their early 60's!!! For thosewho are accustomed to learning languages it may be just a snap, but not for me!The books & charts are wonderful, provided you can make heads or tails of it !!!!Well, at least I know! Judy in Michigan"
1,Why would they make this?,"When I went to the store and saw this CD, I was so happy! Finally a CD with all my favorites and more! YES!..Once I bought it and played it in my car, I thought I got the WRONG band. THIS CD IS NOTHING (STRESSING NOTHING) LIKE THEIR REAL (STRESSING REAL) SONGS. Really soft,slow, and boring. Okay - the songs are like this...They took awesome hits (Livin' On A Prayer,It's My Life,etc...) and DESTROYED them by taking out every speck of tempo and sang the songs like their wife was about to die. Very depressing and sad.I would definatelt NOT recommend this CD (AT ALL)."
1,Very Little Happens,"Coming off such a strong entry (Killing Dance), I was disappointed with this 7th book of the series. Is Laurell running out of ideas? Nothing really happens in the first 125 pages. I can only read so much pretentious bragging and threats made by the vampire council before I'm just not scared by them anymore... an neither, apparently, is Anita. Some sloppy editing and writing make this the worst in the series. For instance, Chapter 16 uses the word ""cool"" FIVE times in the first paragraph. Maybe Laurell should concentrate more on quality and focus less on cranking out her yearly deadline."
1,Free was too much !,"Fairy tales from other countries- prose is awkward, most stories banal and my grandbabies of 4 & 5 would be bored. Sorry, but these ""Color Fairy"" books are lame. ( and I downloaded about 7..all were the same). Skip these free books. I erased all of them as they were a waste space on my Kindle."
1,Doesn't fit bottle,"We bought this product because we're supplementing breast feedings with bottle feedings at night. We'd thought this nipple would fit standard bottles. It doesn't. After one attempt, more milk leaked through the faulty seal between nipple and bottle than made it through the nipple. Yet nowhere does the product information state which bottle the nipple is designed to fit. Only specially designed Playtex bottles at [...] a set? No thanks."
2,Nice,Using this book for a class. Got here on time and am very happy with how the book is so far. No problems.
2,Florist Use These!,these are the go to scissors for florist the 6 1/4 inch they love them! will not crush stems.can find them for around 10. to 12.
1,Cheesy and miscast!,"I wasn't the lucky one since I actually rented this and watched it online. Zac Efron is believable as the leading man, but the leading lady wasn't his match. She looked too old and wasn't attractive enough to play the love interest of such a handsome leading man. The story was cheesy and predictable. The sex scenes looked awkward and I didn't see any chemistry between the lead actors. Efron's acting at times was as weird as Kirsten Stewart's acting in all of the Twilight movies. ""The Lucky One"" will appeal to hopeless romantics who enjoy a love story no matter what. I wanted to know more about Zac Efron's character and see more of the bayou culture...so many scenes with the dogs!!!"
2,Good purchase,Six Years ago I bought this same model. Lately it has been dropping out and I have to reset it. I'm thinking it is starting to have problems so decided to replace it. The reviews on this were very good if you didn't need a N router. The old one worked well for six years so decided to replace with same model.
2,Perfect music for Woyzeck,"I was in a production of Buchner's Woyzeck in the late 60's and all I can say about this CD is that the music that Waits and Brennan have written is perfect for the play, which will be staged at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in October, 2002. It should be a remarkable production."
2,Save Watts and Can Be Folded Down,"I like it because it uses LED that uses very little watts. I expect to install more and more electronic equipments in my boat. Therefore, I don't want anyone of them to use too much electricity.The other thing is that I can fold it down when I need to put the boat back to winter storage and I need to put a cover over it.I have only installed it several months ago. Therefore, I don't know how reliable it is. I guess a LED light should last quite long."
2,Simply the best album to start any Kenny G collection.,"From songs on his first album, to the greats on his forth which made him famous, this is simply the best album to start any Kenny G collection. From the note progression of Esther (track 8), to the spectactular sounds of Songbird (track 10) and Silhouette (track 3), these all make for a quite, romantic evening at home with that special someone."
1,an empty chair,"I can see the inspiration for Clint's talking to an empty chair after enduring this movie which has no substance. It's a movie that needed a better script and in my version at least - the english subtitles stopped working in the french scenes early on and refused to turn back on - so those scenes were so much ""gibberish"" to me.Save your money - read a good book instead."
1,interesting book if you already have a knowlege of art,"I was required to read this book for a graduate course I am taking. Having no background knowledge in 80's artist and only hearing of a handful of these artists prior to reading this book, I felt in the dark most of the time. Not being familiar with the artists' work(s) created a missing link for me while reading this book. I may have been more interested in what these artists had to say if I was more familiar with their works. Even the few pictures the book did reproduce, were not that helpful. If you have a fairly good grasp on the works of these artists, read this book. If you don't like art or are not really familiar with the interviewed artists, this is not a book for you."
2,I hate steven King novels....,"I actually dont enjoy reading King's novels and have watched many of his movies, without appreciating them, so when this movie came out I figured what another waste of tape. Sure there was bigname actors in it, but so what???This one surprised me!! It scared me, it thrilled me, the story of the interaction between the kids and the adults was absolute genius.The acting was superb, and believable. A great thrilling movie!!!"
2,Babylon 5 - a wonderful surprize,"True, the first season is not the best one, but the quality improvement in audio and video make this a must for Babylon 5 addicts like me. I hope I will not have to wait long for the following seasons."
1,Leaks oil,"As previous reviewers said, you can not rely on this thing to seal - either @ the top with the large-diameter cap or the side, with the small-diameter cap. Unacceptable."
1,Didnt even work,"YOu get what you pay for. And i guess in this case even less. I just wanted a little extra sound from my ipod, and something that was easy to travel with. This set didnt work with batteries or when i plugged it in. I didnt even care to get a replacement bc you can tell its very cheap, and it wouldnt have mattered."
2,My only Oldfield Album,"I first bought this album in the mid 80s and then it was on vinyl. Since then I have moved a zillion times and I really don't know where all those old vinyls are anymore. I have listened to a lot of weird music before, but this has to be one of the best. Family man is incredible, and so is five miles out. Buy it, if you are like me and not totally sold on the tubular bells concept, but actually like the synthesis of pop/oldfield (can't think of a more suitable description of this genre)."
1,leaks,"I bought the vipp soap dispenser because I liked the looks and it appeared to be made of quality materials. I tried using clear neutrogeena liquid soap in it. Unfortunately, the seal between the top and the bottom doesn't prevent the soap from leaking out. Consequently, I have to constantly rinse off and wipe down the dispenser. It has even leaked from the bottom rubber seal. I contacted the company and they admitted that they had had problems with the dispenser and told me that they would send me a replacement that would be better, but I never received the promised replacement. I am very disappointed in the product because it was relatively expensive to purchase."
1,hmm...,"This is yet another overhyped death metal band that seems to grace the shelves of my local Sam Goody in the mall.Finally succumbing to the ""praise"" the band and this album received, i picked it up after getting my replay $5 certificate in the mail.so...$16.99 + tax (mall prices) - $5.00 (certificate) = $11.99 + tax....i paid too much for this."
2,Excellent Resource and Planning Guide,"Whether you are starting a new campus mediation program from scratch or seeking to improve an existing one, this book is an excellent resource. It clearly and concisely lays out a history of mediation programs on college campuses, explains how and why to implement a new program, and gives helpful instructions for training and educating mediators. This book is a must for any college administrator involved in a mediation program. Bill Warters is a true expert and his extensive knowledge is evidenced in this book."
1,This product broke my daughter's microwave,DO NOT PUT THIS PRODUCT IN YOUR MICROWAVE. I bought it for my daughter and her microwave won't function properly and makes funny noises now. If anyone else has had any problems let me know.
1,very disappointed,Did not like anything about how this was orchestrated no the style or choice of selections.Thank you Bon Jour ciao
2,SERIOUS DRAMA,"I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED, ESPECIALLY WITH THE ENDING. IT SEEMED A LITTLE TOO DRAMATIC FOR MY TASTE. ""TILDA SWINTON"" DOES A VERY CONVINCING PERFORMANCE, SO DOES ""GORAN VISNIC"" THE MAN WHO PLAY'S THE BLACK-MAIL COLLECTOR. BUT I FELT THERE WASN'T TOO MUCH TO BACK UP THE PLOT. THE HIGHLIGHT IN THE FILM FOR ME WAS WHEN ""TILDA, EXPLAINS HOW IT'S LIKE TO BE A MOTHER WITH RESPONSIBILITIES, HOW HARD IT IS TO COLLECT $50.000. BESIDES THE PERFORMANCES THE MOVIE OVER DOE'S IT WITH THE MELLA-DRAMATIC. GABRIEL"
2,new gram,I am a new grandmother and very exciting for the opportunity to read to my grandson! These books are perfect. I remember them from when my girls were young - still just as fun!
2,Great Book,This book teaches great skills for those just wanting to learn the art of cartooning. I highly recomend it for your artistic child who can broadin his/or her artistic views of the world. Cartooning is also great for young children and this book makes it great.
2,Beautiful classic!,"This is a verbally and visually stunning book. The story and poetry is captivating for a small child, and the illustrations are magnificent. I loved this book as a child and now often give it as a gift at baby showers. Highly recommended!"
2,Kungfu,"It is fight night in china town when you watch this movie, plenty of fight scenesand action, you are never bored with this one."
1,The Music Is Pretty...But...,"I tried to like this CD! I really did. I gave it a fair chance. But I'm afraid that I do not like it that much. I Love the idea of using the piano and adding a bit of soul/R&B to it. However, LYRICS count for something too!!!! All the songs are talking about the same thing, and they are poorly written. I'm sorry, but in my opinion the fact that she wrote every song on the album does not say all that much for her. I really really like the piano playing though. She is very gifted at that. But she really needs to learn how to write good LYRICS! I guess Jill Scott has spoiled me with having wonderful lyrics. Now, I expect more than the typical, same-ol-same-ol that Alicia Keys delivers. Sorry, but I had to be honest!!"
1,Disappointing,"I just can't find the Oscar material here. Keep in mind Steven Soderbergh is one of my favorite directors (""The Limey"" is destined to be a classic, I believe) and yes, the film is well shot and edited, but I find the subject matter... well, boring and predictable. I'm told by female friends that Erin is a ""hero"" to them. Hm? Single mom dresses and talks like a prostitute, has an uncontrollable temper, and takes everything personally, and wonders why people won't give her a break. Ok.... Single mom can't pay the phone bills but seems to have an endless supply of cash for spiked-heeled shoes. Am I leaving anything out? Oh, right: Once the class action suit is in place, the participants are more comfortable with her than the trained lawyers. Very nice, people skills are important in the legal profession. So is knowledge of the law! This is a blueprint for a heroine?"
1,"Great Show, Terrible Blu-Ray","Season Two of Mad Men is brilliant, and it needs to be to get through this terrible blu-ray disc. You put the discs in, and then there's just blackness for an inordinate length of time. You think the disc isn't working, but it is. Then an empty red battery appears on the screen. You follow its progress from not filled in at all to partially filled in, finally to completely filled in. Then more blackness. Then finally a Clorox commercial. More blackness. The MENU doesn't appear until who knows how long. And if you watch an episode and then stop and leave, when you come back, it will not take you to where you left off. Instead, you have to sit through the seemingly endless screen blackness all over again, then the battery slowly filling, then the commercial, etc. etc. I have one of the newest and highest rated blu-ray players out there. And I have not had this problem with any other blu-ray. This is by far the most poorly made blu-ray disc ever."
2,Best tea press,The Bodum French Press is a great tea press. Quality built makes a great gift for the women in your life.
2,WHAT A MOVIE,"This was a great film. I loved the plot and the beginning was great: seeing Indy's roots in adventure. Sean Connery was magnificent as Henry Jones. I only hope that it will not be the Last Crusade, i hope to see Indy on the big screen once more."
1,Garmin is a rip-off!,"The Garmin company is awful. If you buy from them, you will most likely have to deal with their Customer Sevice Dept. Good luck! They act like they are too big to worry about a consumer. They sell out-dated maps(over 1 1/2 years old) in their units, and expect the customer to spend $70 more to update the map in a brand new unit! What good is a GPS that doesn't know some of the roads exist? The customer service department says, ""oh well most people are ok with old maps"". I will not own a Garmin, I would rather be lost!"
2,"I like the style, but not the linear style.","I really like the style; the magic plays out on the screen in a very graphic way. I like the way the characters move about.The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star is its linear storyline. There isn't much choice of where to go and what to do, you just go in the direction the game points you.I don't know much about RPG card games, so maybe this in indicative of them.But all in all it was an interesting way to spend some time."
2,Great Fun!,"I bought this for my 8 month old son. He loves all the lights and sounds. He's not crawling yet, but this really helped encourage him to sit up unassisted. He really wasn't interested in sitting up until we bought him this toy. It has multiple colors and sounds. There are taggies attached to the top that he loves to grasp. Hopefully once he is interested in crawling this toy will come in handy."
2,Excellent,"Another culture novel, branching out in another different direction, I liked it, I'll buy the next one that comes along too. The sentient machine battles are especially good in this one. Many reviewers seem to dwell on the point that they couldnt understand the Excession. Is that not the whole poit! We are seeing and being able to judge the actions of the culture when confronted with the the most difficult situation any society could cope with (ie something infinitely powerfull, infinitely unpredictable and infinitely incomprehensible) how would you fare if confronted by the infinitely powerfull unknown, I think the culture did OK. I especially liked Banks reference to the culture getting themselves into an ""Out of context situation"" well done, I love it.Dave Reid"
2,MY HUNTER HIMIDIFIER 33257,"I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY HUNTER 33257 HUMIDIFIER..IT IS EASY TO CLEAN AND IT KEEPS MY APARTMENT AT A GOOD HUMIDITY LEVEL, SO IT IS NICE AND COMFORTABLE.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT HIGHLY TO ANYONE.ALL YOU NEED TO CLEAN THE UNIT, ONCE A WEEK, IS VINEGAR AND WATER,AND A SOFT SCRUBBY."
2,Lot at the end of the block,"Toddlers enjoy repetition. (For those of you who have just read the same book for the fifth time today to your little one, this is no mystery!). Toddlers also love construction vehicles. The story is a cumulative tale written in the ""House-That-Jack- Built"" style and has bright illustrations showing a 4-story building going up. In other words, _The lot at the end of the block_ is a winning combination for toddlers and other young children who are intrigued by construction. Beware though, your tongue may become tied after multiple readings! I do wish that there was at least one ""token"" female operating some heavy equipment..."
2,lovely lovely lovely (i will say lovely untill i die),it's a wonderful story . Full of love. Full of secrets. Full of happiness.
2,Best book on the topic!,"No matter how many books I read on this topic, I keep coming back to this one :) The design and editorial layout in itself is very appealing; thereforethe publication illustrates as it speaks. It's never a chore to peruse this book, and I don't know if I could have learned as much as I did in a short periodwithout it."
2,Cool lights higher visibility!,"The bulbs are brighter & white! They look good on the car, and as Acura Integra is not a tall car they don't blind or confuse oncoming traffic. I can see further and better no questions asked, the only bummer is that one of the bulbs seems to have lost the gas for I it turns on but not bright just a dying dim light... Luckily at this price I bought 2 packs of 2."
1,did anyone edit this?,"There are a few great concepts that Pepperman barely manages to get across but for the most part this Ivy League educated reader was lost. Pepperman uses scenes from films not just as examples, but as the jumping off point for his theories. Yet he doesn't give enough detail that if you haven't seen a scene you can still follow what he's saying (his chicken scratch drawings do little to help). Rather, he provides you every page with a ""hint!"" or a ""tip!"" or if you're lucky a ""hint & tip,"" such as ""ask a lot of questions!"" or ""a study in asymmetrical beats."" (Seriously, I pulled those two at random and they mean little more in context than out). I began to ignore these diversions but holy god, did anyone edit this book?"
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTE BUST OF A BUY, I REALLY LIKE PRIMO, HOWEVER THIS ONE SOUNDS LIKE A DYING MOOSE. NOT IMPRESSED AND NOT EVER GOING TO BY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.SO DISSAPOINTED! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY..."
2,"Inventive, Unorthodox and a Little Dark","This book was a great read - and as usual, Card is inventive and unorthodox. What appears to be an anti-religious tirade settles into a more considered point of view. Meanwhile there are some interesting diversions into things that actually make a society strong and meaningful, and into issues surrounding native Americans, whilst all the time taking the overall story of a seventh son of a seventh son forward.Not Card's best work, but certainly not his worst either - and well worth reading"
1,terrible waste of money,"I've only seen the first installment of the laffapalooza series, but let me tell you...it was the worst stand-up I've ever seen. Not ONE of those ""comedians"" were funny. Don't let your being a fan of Jamie Foxx force you into buying this awful collection of irritating material."
1,An honest review....really,"It's all about the marketing people...really. I've had this vacuum for a few years now. When people hear from the ads that it doesn't lose suction, they think ""awesome!"" Well great suction is great for floors and carpets, but what good is it when it makes the hand tools nearly impossible to maneuver? I mean really, you have to really strain yourself to use the hand tools. Awful design on the hose (not flexible enough to reach without pulling the whole vacuume along or tipping over). If I had to do it over again, I may have paid $150 for this vacuum but definitely not $500. Just like a lot of products out there now, the spiffy marketing campaign about the suction and cutesy design are what makes for the high sticker price, not the machine itself."
2,"Clear, concise and not judgemental","This book is excellent in writing, very easy to read - even for non native english speaking readers. I'm impressed with the level of detail and how the authors enabled me to understand (at least a fraction of) what they experienced in 1965.I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in the Vietnam War, or any war for that matter - especially in respect to the life of a soldier in combat and the lives behind the numbers..."
2,good times...,Test drive 5 was and is a great game. I would spend hours racing my cousin over the summer. truly a fun game for all ages. a definant classic.
1,Ending was too sad. Writing style and conversations lacking.,"I didn't care for the author's writing style. Parts of it seemed like a reporter was writing events that were happening each day. The author was trying too hard to make us not like Robert and his daughter. They were too bad to be believable. Dougless's reasoning didn't feel real to me. I wouldn't think or act like her. Conversations were not interesting. During parts of the middle the reading was tedious and I wanted the book to be over. The last few chapters had me in tears far too much. Yes it was a great love spanning time, but too much sadness. SPOILER: The worst sadness for me was that Nicholas lived the rest of his life back in the 1500s never marrying because he loved Dougless. Even though there was an interesting ending with her finding someone, I was still in tears so I do not consider this a feel good book. Sexual content: moderate."
2,Hot! But Not Hot Enough,"Don't get me wrong,the dvd was good but it seemed liked there was too much narrating,c'mon do we care really about the girls likes and dislikes? anyway,it didn't ruin my enjoyment i think i liked ""sexy sports special"" better though.one great reason to look at Disappearing Lingerie is the fact that Angel Veil(one of the last new Juggies from the Man Show) is on it and there's extra footage of her at the end of the feature.And this dvd is becoming hard to find..."
2,pleased with this purchase,The best way to find filters and you do not have to drive around looking for them. Very pleased with the order and rec'd items in a timely manner.
1,I would give it no stars if possible,"Well, i got this, it worked wonderfully for a few months..Come a few months later, the screen no longer functioned(its blank). Sony wont do anything about it, so, i'm stuck with this waste of money."
1,hueypro,"this product absolutely would not work for me. support staff at pantone tried hard to help....sent me 3 additional units to try. three hueypro devices gave me a distinct red cast and the fourth turned things yellow-green. used the latest software updates and tried to calibrate with each multiple times in different lighting conditions. support staff at x-rite was useless, wanting only to sell me a much more expensive device. i'm returning them all....................."
1,Awful,This was given to me as a gift. I believed it to be another hits collection. I found out that George Martin and son had fricked-up some of the greatest rock n roll music in the world. Why would anyone tamper with what was one of the greatest song writing teams and music groups that was the Beatles. If George Martin needs money I'll send him twenty bucks but please leave the classics alone.
2,Not Bad!!!,"I'm not a big Luther Vandross fan, but this CD shows promise!! The best track is I'm Only Human , with the talented Cassandra Wilson! They should record an album together!"
1,too small,i wish these were bigger since then they would have a use. i can't use them so it's just another waste of money.
2,great deal,i didn't expect much but it was great last summer. My 2 year old son and his friends loved it. SO did the dog who chewed on it and by some miracle didn't tear it. Great value!
1,Ipod docking boombox,"The 1st day I was pleased with this productThe second day the unit started pausing the IPOD all by itself in the middle of playing a song without my touching it.The 3rd day it would not allow me to change the radio stations.I will try to return this item to the seller for I fear if I use it again it may even self destruct the next time I try to use it.Perhaps I just got a bad unit out of all they sell, but I wouldn't bet on it."
2,inexpensive scrub solution,"Great price, acceptable product. I would like a recyleable non plastic container though, or at least the choice for such a container. The container is an acceptable and usable container."
1,This DVD sucks,"I know yes since 1975 and love the gruop, but the mix in this DVD is cold, sterile, the bass is buried and brutally compressed,. Iam sorry, but it is the sad true,Better get yessongs dvd, 900125 live dvd and the very good live in amsterdam dvd."
1,My First Anita Shreve novel-My last,"As an avid reader, I have always prided myself on getting through books quickly, thoroughly, and always shutting the final page with a satisfied sigh and a feeling of wonderment. There has been only one exception-this novel. I found it very difficult to get through, as the narrator is a despicable bore. Although Anita Shreve portrays the Victorian era very well, I found the descriptions to be dry and lacking in imagination. The beginning and middle lasted far too long, and the ending was too short,although I was grateful that my misery was finally at an end. This was my first Anita Shreve novel and as other reviewers have described this work as one of her best, it is sure to be my last."
2,Good Movie,"I bought this movie because I had just finished the book and it looked really interesting with the main chick from LAW&ORDER SVU, and it turned out really good. Shipping was fast and easy and there were no problems with payment or any other issues. Thanks much!"
1,Not The Original Versions,"Out of the 20 tracks on this 2-CD set, only four tracks are the original versions (Ya Ya, Moon River, Raindrops, The Mountain's High). The rest are re-makes. If your truly love oldies, this is not the CD set for you."
1,Terrible...,"I'm desperate for a decent low-carb chip, but you'd have to be way beyond desperate to eat these things."
2,the two markets wizards are very good books,"Le livre de Schwager ne doit pas tre le premier achat du débutant, celui-ci se trouvera en effet frustré par le fait que tous ces grands traders ne livrent pas leurs méthodes et se contentent de raconter leurs débuts et quelques expériences de trading. Mais l'apprentis spéculateur un peu plus expérimenté remarquera que tous ces traders, bien qu'utilisant des méthodes trés variés et ne travaillant pas tous sur les mmes période de temps, font référence sans cesse aux deux choses qui sont les plus importantes à leurs yeux: la discipline et le money management. L'interview de Larry Hite sur le money management est un petit bijou.Pour conclure, la compréhension de ce livre ne nécessite pas un niveau d'anglais trés élevé, c'est le parlé courant qui est utilisé.....donc à la porté de tous les franais ayant fait un jour un tour au lycée."
1,Mostly A Complete Bore,"""Cujo"" is about a rabid St Benard who turns on a woman and her son, adopted from the Steven King novel. Not much to say about the film. It's rather boring with notthing to grasp your desire for entertainment, save where the dog makes a few scary poses. The actors do little to enliven things or make sense of it. Plus the direction, story and editing is often sloppy and nonsensable. Plus, I've sworn the the blood in the gory scenes looked orange instead of red for some reason. In the end, ""Cujo"" is often forgettable and is more likely to put you to sleep than scare you."
2,Had it for over a year and my family still loves it,I bought this last year for my 5 year old son. He loved it then and still does now at 6. He is better at it than I am but I can manage to get the ants in. If you push too hard on the plastic ants they can get a little bent out of shape and not work as well. Just pinch them so they aren't as flattened down and they work fine. He loves that it's a game that he is better at than I am. Just to put it into perspective..we got a wii this year- but he will put down the wii to come play a game with me. He enjoys having an adult play with him and it's a great way to get laughter started. I would advise waiting until they are old enough to play- 4-5. Kids younger might not have enough dexterity.
2,Transall Saga,It was the best book ive ever read! I would have never read this book unless my librarian showed me that there was a new Gary Paulsen book out. He's my favorite author so I knew I had to read it. Gary Paulsen should keep writing books forever.
2,FROM KENTUCKY TO THE UNIVERSE AND BEYOND,"A brilliant personal , local and universal book of poetry , proseand mythology. MaMa is one of the most beautifull xmas storiesi have encountered. A lovely slice of down home true life fiction that makes me laugh with joy! Raven Hair and Turquoise , You Grow Wild in my Heart ,and Many Moons fill the Sky are heartfelt barenaked honest poetrythat is seldom encountered in a literary landscape littered withheartless wordplay & cynicism. This book has a Huge Heart and is destined to be a classic."
1,Be very careful about ordering from The Firm,"We have dealt with this company on a couple of occasions (giving them the benefit of the doubt the second time). To date we still have not received the videos that we ordered (though they assured us they would arrive by Christmas), but they have charged our credit card. Their customer service is severely inadequate and failed to provide any answers (other than giving us a tracking number for a product that has yet to be shipped). We will not work with them again and warn others that dealing with this company may cause them similar problems."
1,Underpowered,"As soon as I used this jump starter to attempt a start of my lawn tractor, it signaled that it needed to be charged despite the fact that this was the first use after it was initially charged until the green light came on.I recharged it until the green light came back on and tried again to charge the lawn tractor battery-still nothing.I finally used a plug in battery charger and that did the trick. I don't know how useful this unit would be if I needed it to jump start a car battery."
1,Worthless as a UPS,"Provides no battery backup at all - acts ok as a bulky surge protector maybe but will NOT provide power in case of regular power failure. I've had reasonable success with APC ups's, but don't bother with this one.I would have given this 0 stars if I could."
2,Excellent video of a great concert,"The Concert for Bangladesh film is extraordinary, and the DVD version is quite excellent. The sound quality is superb, with great mixing and balance. The video quality is also high. The performances are outstanding. George Harrison is great, calm and resolute though somewhat serious and humble. I think he felt this befitting the seriousness and gravity of the situation that inspired this first rock benefit concert. The other stars also have a somewhat serious approach, except for the delightful performance by Billy Preston (who can hardly contain his joy and enthusiasm!). Bob Dylan's voice is great. He looks very young as he performs some of his most famous early pieces. Clapton plays very well in a supporting role and does not seek the spotlight.The bonus material is very good. The duet by Harrison and Dylan is a great. Interesting insights into the production of the film, and other documentary info.Highly recommended!"
2,Pretty good knife,"Held up pretty decent so far. The case itself bent after a motorcycle accident and gave me a bruise :(. But even after that the knife is just fine. It does get dull after a ton of use. Used it a bunch as a box cutter, held up well.I thought it was a bit small at first, but it actually works pretty well still."
2,A REAL EXPERT SPILLS THE BEANS!,"It is obvious from the beginning of this book that the author is not only truly experienced but is revealing some REAL INSIDER INFO! So many of these mail-order books just rehash the same tired junk...not this one! Mr. Thomas lets you in on the inside and lays it all out in a simple, easy to follow step-by-step method. Anyone of average intelligence could use his techniques to make some REAL MONEY in mail order. i truly great piece of work!"
2,Racing Lawn Mowers,"I replaced the OEM plug we use on my Honda GX390 with the E3. I do not have a dyno to check hp, but it did make a noticable difference. It does not stall at idle anymore and the power seems to be as stronger, through the entire rpm range."
2,THE BEST TOUR EVER CREATED,"Yes Madonna created that tour and it seems to be the best any artist can come up with. Very capturing and breathtaking and simply the best. Since human creations are not 100 % than the only drawback for this tour (for other people and not for the hardcore fans) is that she did few from her old hits (Like A Prayer, Papa Don't Preach, Express Yourself and even her new hits Like American Pie and You'll See , although she did You'll See on some dates but was not included here) Anither Drawback for the fans and the other people is that there is no extra features (...) like the Don't Tell me Video or Making of Documentary just small picture galary. But still a perfect item to have"
2,Can I give this 10 stars?,"I took a huge gamble when I ordered this perfume. First, I had never smelled it before. Second, it's not exactly cheap. So when I received it in the mail, I was completely surprised--and amazed. This is quite possibly the best perfume I have ever smelled, and definitely the best I have ever owned. It's completely unique and sophisticated, without smelling too mature. I just can't get enough!"
1,Product does not fit DVD outer title inserts,I returned this product as it does not accommodate the outer title insert - only the inner page. Product recommended for customers who do not wish to keep the outer slipcase cover page.
1,gun does suck,"I got this gun april 12, 2:40,... and it broke 10 minutes later.2 shots then the bb's fall into the back/ it dosn't shoot anymoreno safety/ directions in asian/ screws come rusted and the gun smells and feels old/ shoots so bad that you can watch the bb's in the air.TAKE MY ADVICE!!! it looks great but SUCKKSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Great book for a donation,Those are some great reviews. Reality s**** though... not worth the time or money.
1,Makes other bad horror novels look good by comparison,"I randomly picked this up from a used book store, never having heard of Brian Keene, and I was bored with the book within the first 20 pages. Keene is just a bad writer. No, he's a terrible writer. The characters are cardboard, and their dialogue is so very atrocious that it is difficult to believe that Keene has ever heard another human being speak. I didn't expect much of a plot in a book about zombies, but the constant ""protagonists threatened by swarming zombies"" quickly gets boring here. I do like the idea of zombies via demonic possession, but Keene's cheesy dialogue makes the demons as dull as everything else in this book."
1,not what I expected,I thought I was ordering a book with punctuation refreshers but it was so complicated and not what I expected. Returned the book.
1,"""Progressive"", not progressive","This is a studious tribute to the classic Prog Rock sound of Genesis, Yes, and ELP of course. But what this CD lacks is the magic that made these older bands shine.Yes and Genesis did what they did and the public called it Progressive. They were simply being progressive (lowercase p). SMPTe sounds like these bands. They set out to make Prog Rock. But it is not progressive. They lack the visionary and charismatic leadership that Peter Gabriel, Jon Anderson, and Fish brought to their bands. The singer (Neal Morse) has a nice voice. His voice and compositions remind me of the great power pop of Jellyfish (""The King is Half-Undressed). No magic, just exceptional musicianship.I do enjoy listening to this CD. It does not suck but it's not much more than what's on the surface."
1,What drove them to make an album like this?,"When this cd first came out i was really pumped. After thouroghly enjoying destruction by definition (one of the better cd's ive heard) and moderately enjoying battle hymns i was expecting them to put out a killer album. Wow, i was really really wrong. What i got was crap. Generic pop punk at best. They also have seemed to take up a new image. My thinking is they're doing the money/sellout thing, but who knows. All i know is that this cd was HUGE dissapointment. My advice is to skip this one and stick with DBD."
2,Great It was a gift,This was a wonderful Gift For My Brother he totally enjoyed this movie . I would recomend this movie to everyone
1,Okay...if you feed it one sheet at a time,"Count me among those with the paper jam problem. If I have more than one sheet of paper in the feeder, it will suck all of them in and jam. It is remarkably efficient in that it does this EVERY time! The printer worked fine for a year or so, but now I'm forced to feed it one sheet at a time. Seems like this is a common problem."
1,laughably lame script,"I have never been a fan of Clint Eastwood, but my friends wanted to get this movie from the video rental store, and it had the encouraging two thumbs up from Ebert and pal, so I gave it a shot. Clint still totes a gun, and still gets the girl, a young Latina, even younger than his real-life wife Dina Ruiz who makes two brief appearances as a TV reporter. The intracacies of the murder plot are fine, though not any better than an average episode of ""Boomtown"" or ""Law and Order,"" leading up to the usual climactic firearm battle. However, the script gives these poor actors a long list of laughably ridiculous lines which really can't be delivered with any realistic authority. Watch at your own risk, this is bad, bad stuff."
2,Excellent-EXCELLENT! First Reader,This very cute book had my three-year old reading it TO ME within 20 minutes. He loved it. We both did. The illustrations are adorable and the thick pages will withstand all that a toddler has to muster. I'm SO happy that I bought this book.
2,BAD PACKAGING,"THE PACKAGING FALLS APART, THE DISCS ARE HARD TO ACCESS. AND THERE IS A POSIBILITY OF SCRATCHING A DISC. USE A 320 DISC CASE AND YOU CAN KEEP EVERY STAR TREK DVD IN ONE CASE WITH ROOM FOR EXPANSION AND EASY ACCESS."
1,Poor Quality.... Stinks in days..,This is of poor quality. It worked only for 2 weeks. It started stinking and noticed mold formation. Even after I changed the water multiple times.
2,For grandkids,"Bought this for the grandkids,to camp in the backyard.I like it a lot,and they did also.I will buy one for me also."
1,Vtech I5808 Full Color Accessory HAndset/Picture Caller ID,Got the phone condition is great although they say it's tested and it will not sync to the main base called tech and the can't get it to work what should I do?
2,Heads Up,Please check comment which I wrote in the Vitamin column.I see an improvement using this product for my hair.
2,FURminator works nicely,"FURminator works nicely for my two Exotic Shorthairs, who have very thick fur. I can detect MUCH less loose hair on my furniture and clothes! The first combing was a storm of fur in my face, but with daily use, that problem is not so bad for me."
2,A great help,"i am thirteen years old and consider myself to be quite shy around people I am not familiar with. Many of the stories in this book have helped me overcome my shyness towrds others with storeies like ""I try to remember"". I know that I will be rereading this book to help me through the many trials that we face in life and therefore give it 5 stars."
1,Photos Dated,"There is a tremendous variety of clip-art and photos, but if you're focused on photos for use in a modern context, you'll be disappointed.The photos seem very dated - maybe 10-20 years old, so not very usable for modern web work, also their Hi-res is low res.Eoghan Odinsson, Award Winning Author of ""Northern Lore: A Field Guide To The Northern Mind, Body & Spirit"""
1,Terrible Car for Toddlers,My biggest complaint is that this car does not have a seatbelt. My son is 10 months old and I get very nervous that he will fall out and if you put the top up you cannot even see your child. I am shocked that they did not include a seat belt like other riding cars have. I actually had to go out and buy the Step2 buggy (which my older son had) because it is a much better product and includes a seat belt. Do not buy this!
2,Great Addition to the Series,"So far I have all of the CDs in the ""Hard to Find 45s"" series. This is a great addition. Nearly impossible to find most of these cuts on any other CD. This CD brought back memories of many recordings that I had completely forgotten and am now enjoying with every play. Only a few cuts like ""Happy Organ"" are arguably not all that hard to find."
1,Big Disappointment,I was hoping for some real insights into these professionals. Instead I read about the current markets of two years ago!
1,too preachy,"I was looking for resources for my teen-aged daughters to read to discourage sexual activity during high school. I bought four books from Amazon, including this one. I will not have them read this one; I like the title, and some of the stories, but find it way too ""preachy"". The one I ended up really liking and which I will pass on to my daughters to read is called SexSmart; 501 Reasons to Hold Off on Sex, by Susan Browning Pogany, published in 1998 (and still good, and which I found for $10.17)."
1,Had to stop watching it was so bad,"Well, not proud of myself but I rent this movie on Redbox thinking it was the new Disney movie...Well, it was obvious at the first scene it was not the new Disney but I thought well, for $1, let's give it a try. After 5 minutes of torture, I decided it was enough and my girls did not even complain, just to let you know how bad it was...AVOID at any price!"
1,Didn't work on Stag M2 or Colt AR-15,"Holes didn't line up well, and much loser than a standard foregrip and M4 attachment should be. Might work for others, but junk in my book"
1,Worthless,"This case is ONLY good for the flat matchbox toys. I had purchased it hoping to put my son's matchbox, hot wheels, and other similar cars in it. The slots are too small for almost all of his cars. It has a larger slot in the middle that I can use but it only holds 1 car/truck, so essentially I can only put 4 of his cars in the box. I guess the clear plastic box will be coming out as this isn't worth anything. Save your money if you don't have JUST the small flat hot wheels toys."
2,Great read.,It was a great read. Very fun and exciting. The story was very well developed and thought out. I highly recommend this book.
1,marketing hype ....,"--It is not bad at all, but simply NOT deserve the attention. I have to admit the marketing is incredible effective! Waaaaaaaay over rated!It really deserves 2 or 3 stars, but I'd like to compensate ....--"
2,"5 stars in 1993, 4 stars in 1999","When this came out over 5 years ago, this was a great live album showcasing where Steven was at that point. The amazing thing is he has become so much more of an artist since then. A newer and better compilation, ""Greatest Hits"" which came out in 1997 includes two Abbey Road versions of material from ""Signs of Life"" (""The Walk"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") as well as two great new songs (""Not Home Yet"" and ""I am Found in You""). The parts in this live album where Steven talks are very personal and touching, and the overall energy in the album is tremendous. However, the ""sound"" is really not as crisp and clean as his usual studio efforts, which loses something especially for all the guitar work. All of the really great tracks on this album are on ""Greatest Hits"" which I believe is a much better introduction to his music."
1,This man is a reliable source? PLEASE.,"Mr. Kaplan used to go around with an old suitcase on which there was a piece of silver duct tape, on which he had written ""Vampirologist"". In it he carried a mallet and a wooden stake just in case he had to kill any vampires. He started a ""Vampire Research"" institute. He was a true believer in the Amityville story and tried to convince the Lutzes and another researcher to become involved in a book deal with him so he could cash in on the story. When his overtures were rebuffed by the Lutzes he decided to do anything he could to get even and became a critic. A VERY UNRELIABLE critic. And we are supposed to put any value at all in anything he says? PLEASE."
2,zoids are actualy cool,i know what most people are thinking im a zoids geek but really zoids are fun besides most zoids fans didnt like zoids than saw the show got hooked on the show then took it to the next level by getting the game or models and we dont make fun of all of you wathching sponge bob who is very gay (happy) with guys but anyway the game is going to be like the show (which that is good because they took the show off cartoon network) so if your like me and you wana wathch zoids but there isnt anything on remotely good you need to have this game (to bad it isnt out yet) anyway it is going to be asome
2,Sony's DSC-F707 Best Quality and Value,"I've gone through a lot of Digital and 35mm Camera's, and found this to be the best. (The others were high grade Nikon, Canon, and Olympus cameras...)1. The info lithium batteries last a long time, and charge quickly... Cameras using regular batteries will cost you a fortune, and some only get 10-12 shots per set of batteries. This camera doesn't suffer from lack of power.2. The nightshot nightvision feature is fantastic. Taking shots in the dark are illuminating. :)3. The macro photography features make taking pictures very close a simple task. This is something that most cameras cannot do.4. The quality of the photos are wonderful, and that's what it's all about."
2,Smith again transports us to other places/times convincingly,"I have read every book M.C. Smith has written, and Rose is as good as any of them, which is saying a lot. Those who have trouble with some of the plot elements are, imho, judging the issues from todays standards. As for not recognizing his lover, perhaps it is a case of not seeing what we don't wish to see. Is Rose selfish? Again, one can't judge by today's habits. I recommend this book to anyone who can put aside their modern judgements and let Smith take them to another time and place."
1,expensive infomercial,"This book claims to be a manual that will teach you magic for use in therapy with kids. It does no such thing. Not a single magic trick is explained in the book. What the book really supplies is a lengthy advertizement enticing the reader to buy specific magic tricks from the author's magic supply company. Each trick will cost you around $10. If you're thinking about learning some magic to help build rapport with children, or to use as analogies in therapy, you would do better to request a free catalog from any magic supplier, and save yourself 30 bucks. You'll be getting the same product!"
1,Stunk.,"I really can't think of anything positive to say about this movie. It was not even down to the so bad it is funny level. It was just mediocre, boring, and stupid. A waste of time, pure and simple."
2,Love this iron!,"So, originally buying this product, I hoped to use it for the dual function of straightening and curling. I use the flat iron part to straighten, but I also use it to curl as well as opposed to the actual curling function. I usually only curl the ends of my hair once over, so I just turn the iron physically. This is not to say I do not find the actual curling function useless, its just that I do not regularly add ""corkscrew"" types of curls to my hairstyle. Just my personal preference I suppose. On special occasions, I will use the curling function and it works great! Overall, I highly recommended this product if you regularly straighten your hair and add a bit of volume by curling it afterwards. Great product!"
1,self-flipping kvm,when it does not flip on its own its pretty cool. Only problem is that it switches to the other computer at will at the most inopportune times. Very frustrating. Not recommended!
2,Fun retirement gift,"I have been giving this item out as a ""fun"" retirement gift to the teachers and staff at my school for the past few years. The price fits into the budget...it is small enough to go on a key chain and always be there ready to take and show pix. Everyone who has received it in the past three-four years has appreciated this novel and useful gift."
2,It's Not Oh so Quiet After All,"This 4 track import CD single of ""Bjork's hit, ""It's Oh So Quiet"" from her ""Post"" CD, is not so quiet indeed! Bjork has brought Middle America to the Big Band era all over again. With the use of a well orchestrated horn section she has lived up this track.This CD will have you gettint up out of your seat adn putting your dancing shoes on! This is definitely a CD that will stay in your 3 CD carousel!"
1,Good,"I like the video, but not as good as the biggest loser 1. The video is broken down differently had hard to set up a total workout, also the woman instructor in the video is half dressed and I have a hard time looking at that while I'm working out. I try to set up the workout with Bob Harper leading them even thou they are designed for the men. Like it ok, but would chose the first one over this one."
1,Unsatisfied - Customer service is horrible,"I bought this product and the first time out one of the sprocket assemblies came apart. Called Customer service they sent me the wrong part. Called again, got disconnected. Called again and they sent me the wrong part once again. I want my money back for this cheaply made product."
2,Very Real and true,"I didn't even know this movie was a true story until after I saw it. Then when I read about what happened in real life, I had a new appreciation for this film because it stayed so true to the real story and did a great job developing the characters. It's about a teenager going nowhere in life, Marty (Brad Renfro), who is being bullied by his supposed best friend, Bobby. Bobby bullies everybody, he's raped Marty's girlfriend and her best friend. As a result, Marty and a group of friends decide that the world would be a better place if they murdered Bobby. The film is really graphic, in violence and sexuality. It's very realistic and touching. If you liked the movie ""Kids"", you should like this movie. It's less like a documentary than ""Kids"" and has more of a story."
2,THE COMPLETE and UNFORGETABLE story of Joseph's faith.,"Never have I read with such diligence a story with such meaning, character and direction as: ""Joseph: A Man of Absolute Integrity."" From the first chapter to the conclusion, Joseph's story, as it is recounted and explained by Charles Swindoll, provides twentieth century explanation, definition and direction of historical records and writings for the reader. You will not want to put it down until your finished reading it!!!"
2,"A fun, page turning read","This is the story of Angel - a young woman who, at the outset of the story, has no real ambitions in life. She's a serious book lover who's seemingly fulfilled by propping up her unpublished author/boyfriend. To further his own goal of becomming published, this boyfriend encourages Angel to apply for a position at a successful literary agency. Angel gets the job, and in so doing, finds a purpose in life. But this agency is filled with wacky co-workers and a malignant boss. Though I found Angel's tolerance for her boss, co-workers and boyfriend beyond annoying, I kept reading for the simple reason that I identified with Angel's passion for books. All the oddball characters surrounding this book lover notwithstanding, as the story unfolded, the little mysteries held my attention.This is no literary masterpiece. But as far as commercial fiction goes, it's an enjoyable read."
1,"I gave it a try, but I'm sending it back.","I really wish companies would actually show the brushes (even when they are not included) in the snapshot of the case. I own professional-sized make-up brushes, which would not at all fit in this case. The description said that ""one could easily close the flap down over the brushes"". This is not true. If I were to do this, my brushes would definitely be smooshed! There weren't even enough slots for all of them. Needless to say, I'm a bit disappointed.However, I will not discourage all buyers from this product. If you own just a few brushes (12 or less), and they are small/short brushes without a lot of fullness, then this case would be perfect for you. Yes, this case is ideal for someone who needs a place to store their seldomly used make-up brushes. If you are looking for an everyday roll bag, I suggest looking elsewhere because the quality of this bag is less than stellar."
2,The clapper really does work,"It works so good it works too good. I love this product, however, dont put it in your bedroom if you tend to be a noisy sleeper or loud in the sheets.....LOL! It picks up on sounds easily and quickly and the lights can be going on and off......."
1,Wrong,The episode description is inaccurate and needs to be corrected. This episode has Crichton and others going back in time at a memorial and changing the timeline in a negative way.
2,works well,"The cord worked very well sound quality is better from my computer to my speakers then from Mp3 player to speakers, cord also could be longer is a little shorter then one imagines from picture but all in all good product.Everything connected very easily and stay secure very well."
2,Careful of European DVD,"Earlier a reviewer wrote: ""Good news to all. Carmen and the Carlos Saura Dance Trilogy are available on DVD (PAL) if you visit www.flamencoexport.com. Shipping is a bit expensive but each DVD only costs around 21 Euros."" Careful, folks, the DVD PAL formatwill not work on the DVD player most Americans have purchased.Those folks will need the DVD NTSC format. And yes why hasn't anAmerican distributer converted this wonderful film to the NTSCformat? Such a shame this film is not available!"
2,Good,It's really cute.and make me feel fresh.good to use.and it's safety.it could be used for whole night.i likes it .
2,Manual,Good service and not a bad price either. Well satisfied with price as well as quality of merchandise. They produced what they promised.
2,Soul...Pure Soul.,"Simply put, Elvis Costello is (in my humble opinion) one of the greatest song writers ever to ever record an album. ""Get Happy"" is (for the most part) a nod to the R&B and Soul music that he loves, including a handful of covers. This edition of ""Get Happy"" is a must for any collector of great music. There are thirty songs on the bonus disc alone, and fifty songs all together. If you love Soul, buy this album. The influences are usually obvious, and some of the more subtle ones are pointed out by EC in the liner notes. If you are looking to get into EC, check out ""My Aim Is True"", ""This Year's Model"", or ""Armed Forces"" to start with. If you can't get enough of those, then by all means, ""GET HAPPY""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Good choice between easy nibbles or time-consuming feats,"I actually just reviewed this book as part of a summer cookbook roundup of around 20 books, and voted it the best in the lot. Why? I chose simple, quick recipes to make, and they all turned out perfectly. Guests actually asked me where I bought the gorgeous breadsticks (Martha's quick sticks). Made those in five minutes flat. I also made the blue cheese and pecan crackers (another five whole minutes out the window), the sesame crusted chicken sandwiches (my sister in law, who is a very picky eater, raved). I wasn't about to start filling grapes with cheese, or stuffing cherry tomatoes; that's just not me. But there are enough economical, easy dishes in here to suite even the kitchn tyro."
2,Nonstop Intrigue,"Wow! I couldn't stop watching this well-written, well cast, fabulously performed movie. From the opening moments until the credits rolled, it blew my eyes out. McAvoy is obviously the best known actor to Americans, but the entire cast was STUNNING. Even those with small parts were entirely believable and added their piece to making this one incredible mini series. There was only one tiny misstep and that is why did the police shoot to kill the hitman when they could have taken him down without that? Ah, I guess the answer is that you wouldn't have had such a great time unraveling ""who dunnit!"""
2,Power shovel snow remover,"I can say this product has worked prefectly. It kept it from snowing. I knew if I bought any kind of snow removal tool it would keep the snow level down. So far virtually no snow!So until there is any amount of snow, this is all I can comment on.Bruce"
2,wrist/thumb splint,"This is a very good product. I had tried several others without sucess. I did not need the metal splint on the inside of the hand and easily removed it. To keep the metal splint on the back side of the hand from rubbing against the back of my hand, I inserted a doubled piece of cardbord which works well. I would suggest a broader plastic or other semi-rigid insert to replace the narrow metal insert. All considered, it works very well and keeps me playing tennis till an injury recovers."
2,Blocks!,"My 1 year old loves these blocks, they are fun to stack-up and knock-down. My one complaint is that the blocks are very chewable. My son has been able to bite off an edge of one of the blocks, which is a hazard in many ways. If your baby is a biter watch his or her play time carefully!"
1,Drudgery!,"Right from the start this book seemed like a cumbersome read, and although I stayed with it for a hundred pages or so, at some point I asked myself WHY? Although I'm in the minority here, this book was simply too much work with little reward, and I've learned to be wary of over the top accolades."
2,Wordless Wagner,"For those who can not sit through an entire Wagner opera, here we have Stokowski-Wagner. Stokowski re-orchestrates the vocal parts for orchestra, so what you have here is the best opera for orchestra. It practically proves that Wagner could have written symphonies if he wished. Stokowski elicits lush orchestral qualities from Houston, and the results are sumptous. Reccomended to those who are not opera fans, but enjoy the melodies from opera."
2,"Smells Wonderful, Makes Dishwashing Pleasant","I must admit I thought the price was a bit high but after using the soap, I don't know if I can go back to the everyday, run-of-mill soap from the local store.The smell is wonderful. It reminds me a man's cologne[it is a masculine aroma] and it lingers on your hands for a while. But frankly, it is soothing. We added some to our hand dispenser, added a little water to make it stretch, and everyone here loves it.It cleans the dishes well and I really can't think of anything negative aside from you may not like that the smell lingers...but we love it. it also cleans our hands nicely and leaves them feeling soft.I use a sponge and add one drop of soap to it [we don't fill the sink with water to conserve]. And that one drop will clean dishes for a setting of three and the pots and pans if they are not too dirty.We are very pleased with this product and recommend it to anyone that wants a pleasant aroma while doing the mundane task of washing dishes by hand."
