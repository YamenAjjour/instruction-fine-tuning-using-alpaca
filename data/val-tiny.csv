555,2,Superior Book,"This is one of the ""bible"" books for anyone looking to improve their flycasting skills. I am a FFF Certified Casting Instructor and use many of the ""Tips"" from within this book."
3491,1,It's a shame,"This book represents how far we've dropped visually as a culture. Especially when there exists books out there, self published, like David Robbins ""Himalayan Odyssey"" that capture true insight into the Tibetan culture over a long, rigourous time and method. Instead, we're once again merely given more of the same pretty landscapes and fuzzy warm children that any passing tourist with a good working knowledge of their camera could do. Art is (was?) a wonderful person, I'm sure, though a mediocre photographer at best. Check out David's book for the real deal. I am a published photographer myself, albeit in a totally different genre."
527,2,Not a gamer,"Blazing Angels 2 is a fun game.It's one of the rare games that is fun and has a storyline. If you kill a character, it's for a good reason. I like that in a game."
3925,1,Terrible...,"I'm desperate for a decent low-carb chip, but you'd have to be way beyond desperate to eat these things."
2989,2,What a great book!,"A nice view of the human side of the Los Alamos Project: It was more than just building a bomb, you know."
70,1,yukky...,I turned this movie off after maybe 15 minutes. Please do not waste your hard earned money like I did!
1756,2,Awesome Battery Tender,I bought this for my 1996 Harley and found this to be the best battery tender. It works great and keeps my battery conditioned over a long Pennsylvania winter! When spring comes my bike's battery is ready to go. I have owned this product for about 2 years and it is great. It is so simple to use and has the connections necessary to use on different batteries. My uncle ended up buying this exact one for his tractor and trolling motor on his boat. He is also impressed by the quality!
211,1,"ryan adams ""demolition""","This release is like waking up with a bad whiskeytown hangover, with a toothache and a cardboard box against your ear for a pillow. i've tried repeatedly, and can find nothing redeeming or even vaguely interesting. It gives the ""y'allternative"" genre a black eye."
196,2,"Suspenseful in its simplicity, review by 17-year old","It's a simple coming-of-age tale, in which young Isaku struggles to provide for his family in their village by the sea. But knowledge of medieval fishing and rites are not the only things the reader can gain from this book.The beauty of this story is its grip on the reader. The prose style is incredibly simple, told almost without emotion, reflecting the routine simplicity of Isaku's life. Yet instead of coming off as dry or clinical, the narrative is harrowing. I have yet to come across another book as matter-of-fact as Shipwrecks that creates such a strong hold on its audience."
803,1,"bleh - mundane writing, boring & unbelievable characters,","oh the horrors of poor writing.Plodding through ""Rama Revealed"" was a wate of my time and I won't be wasting any more on it.My recommendation is to skip it, I couldn't get past 25% of this book. Off the top of my head, read a good Greg Bear SF novel instead."
3409,2,On Grief and Grieving,I was very pleased with the service and the books arrived on time and was everything I expected. I haver purchased other items previusly and have always been pleased both with product and service.
3836,1,Papa Review,The best thing I liked about this movie was the lead actress's clothes and the cute children. The storyline just did not do it for me. I was disappointed. Sorry.
1146,1,Not a 400 mhz bus speed,"The bus speed is 333 on this board. I was misled and purchased one. I was planning to put a 3200+ processor in it, but now I am limited to a 3000+. I am very disappointed with the way this board was represented. False advertising."
1498,2,has more hits per cd than usual,"lots of people complain if every song is not a hit but when I look back at my very extensive collection some of the best artists e.g. mariah carey etc had sometimes only one to at most three best songs on the cd. Britney has at least 3 hits on this cd: baby one more time, from the bottom of my broken heart, and I was born to make you happy. Unlike some artists she is not an imitation of another hit artists: so she gets an A for originality. Her voice is really good."
3858,1,Solaris,"I enjoy all types of Sci Fi, and this is an old story. Maybe because I read the book but I enjoyed the book much more than this move. I was falling asleep......"
3482,1,Shortsighted and not worth the anecdotes,"This account of the infamous Weimar Republic inflation of the 1920s are filled with details that are not well tied together. Instead of repeating the same over and again with variations, the author should have included tables and graphs that would be much more telling. This book doesn't explain much of the fundamental role of foreign and international policies and capital movements in this historic event. Overall, it is spiritless, limited to very superficial accounts and reporting, and boringly written.I would not recommend."
1185,1,Not a Keeper...,"The product description and features sound good, but it is not an especially good value.1. There is not sufficient weight in the base to keep the product from falling over from the weight of the handle.2. The wheels are hollow molded so they are easier to break and hence designed to fail.3. The height adjustor/edge guide is in very close proximity to the blade and not especially secure. If this ever loosened more it would be struck by the blade with might damage the motor.4. The motor is a sealed unit and there is no way to lubricated the motor bearings.5. The advertisement of use for relief cutting aroung base of trees is not exactly a genuine feature. Try cutting a circle in a piece of wood with a hand-held circular saw and you will understand what I mean.I would not buy again. Looks like was designed for use for a season or two tops."
471,1,Do they have any lower ratings?,"Could there be a worse game? Jet Force Gemini is highly overrated, it has bad graphics, the choice range for the weapons is small, and it has horrible control. ...I would rate this gave with a half star if I could!"
594,1,Best in the Biz,"This hydronic zone valve has 3/4"" sweat fittings and a N.O. switch that is used to turn on a 12V or 110VAC pump when the valve opens fully. Ordering & shipping was fast & easy - although installation was not included :)"
321,2,Great cap for the money,"This cap goes great with the pink womens ReD sox shirts. And, is nicely priced in comparison to those sold by the MLB"
1417,1,"Its er, ok...at best","I read the book over a few days after reading the hype about it.It was a pleasant read - but I found it very hollow. There wasnt much substance to it and, after each person visits Eddie and leaves, you feel like there are more questions than answers.The book didnt do much for me and had no lasting impact..."
1674,2,Another excellent Tori album,"Tori Amos is sure one talented woman! She's been releasing great albums all along her career combining her amazing voice with piano and subtle yet very emotional songwriting. This album is no exception! This time she adds some more interesting elements such as electronic sounds to enrich some of her songs. No matter what she does though the effect is simply amazing. While not as good as her earlier albums ""From the Choirgirl Hotel"" is a very nice addition to your Tori Amos catalogue and a very good album to own."
3590,2,Review improper channels,"Excellent fun, movie that has aged very well, I enjoyed seeing it again. Recommend.Hopefully I have added a photo of the little girl all grown up!"
1703,2,"Good performance, but","This is the 3rd Royal Albert titles concert I have watched, the video on all 3 is unimaginative, but not terrible.Adele is a powerful singer in every respect and it comes across on the video.Adele knows how to play her audience, this is evident.Like the Sting concert, I guess the most common pronoun and adverb in the English Language is now the F bomb, at least for these two performers. I didn't get it at the Sting concert and I don't get it with Adele. Perhaps British for ""I'm not a silver spoon?""Anyway great display of her talents, but her mouth takes away from her brilliant performance."
2540,1,Oh please!,"A movie that takes itself too seriously with unintended laugh out loud humor is bound to fail. Such is the case with this worthless movie that in two words is aptly described, namely, IT STINKS. Sharon Stone doesn't have any charisma not that if she did it would save this train wreck of a film. Why bother writing a review for this film. I just wasted 2 minutes doing that."
205,2,Backing up in style,I like this devise so much that I plan to get another as a back up. Great picture size just like the factor. I connected it to my back up light wire so it comes on when I shift into reverse. It comes on in a second and shows everthing behind my Dodge Caravan. Wiring took a few hours but I wanted no wire showing. There are no wiring instructions but you really don't need them. It makes a beep when I shift into reverse so I know that it is on. My neighbor saw it and now he wants one.
3887,2,Beautiful classic!,"This is a verbally and visually stunning book. The story and poetry is captivating for a small child, and the illustrations are magnificent. I loved this book as a child and now often give it as a gift at baby showers. Highly recommended!"
3248,2,Dilated Strikes a Cord,"This is by far the best album of the year. Platform was a great album, but what Rakaa(Iriscience), Ev, and Babu bring to the table on this one is unbelievable. From start to finsh you can bump this whole album through, there is not one song I didn't like on it. It by far exceeds my expectations. DJ Premier, Da Beatminerz, Babu, Ev, JuJu, Joey Chavez, Alchemist, ?uestlove, and Ev bring some sick beats. No Pete Rock on this sadly, but the beats get your head noddin. I suggest you get this album right now and you wont regret it. Well what are you waiting for? GET IT!"
2131,2,nice,"I got 43 opks and 13 hcg, i will keep every one posted on how it goes, test can before it said and was really nice"
1255,2,pop/rock brilliance,"These guys are always going to live in the shadow of ""Jealousy"". It would be near impossible to write a better ,more perfect song. But, not impossible to write some that are just as good !This album is full of beautiful melodies,great harmonies,jangling guitars,and, i love it!!!This is pop/rock at it's best. It may have been recorded with a smaller budget than some of their other recordings, but,who cares .""Big Budget"" usually means ""Big Producer"" which always means,someone getting between the band and their music.I'm really glad that the Gin Blossoms are back.Now, if i could just convince them to come to Cairns(Australia)"
2299,1,no breakthrough,"she sounds terrible, her voice is yucks! and r all her sounds repeating by itself...come on have a breakthrough!"
1226,2,"Her first-person exploration reveals a teaming, vivid world underfoot","Under Ground: How Creatures Of Mud And Dirt Shape Our World focuses on soil and the creatures which evolve from there to shape our lives: from worms in a Minnesota forest which are making the soil too rich for wildflowers to mud-dwelling animals on the ocean floor, and soil microbes affecting both wilderness areas and gardens. Her first-person exploration reveals a teaming, vivid world underfoot."
3918,2,great deal,i didn't expect much but it was great last summer. My 2 year old son and his friends loved it. SO did the dog who chewed on it and by some miracle didn't tear it. Great value!
2464,1,Wrong Coloring,"The watch is nice, it may be a little small for my boyfriend's preference but I ended up returning the item because the color was so different from what was actually featured online. I order gunship expecting a dull gray or black tint watch but the watch that arrived was blue. It wasn't quite navy blue either, a little lighter then navy. I returned the watch today."
2383,1,Terrible Sound Quality,"This is a poor Sprint phone, full of crackle and echo. When I went in to complain, they did not seem surprised (I was beyond the 30-day return period).Seems that they sell these knowing many people will not figure out what a piece of useless crap it is before the return period is over."
149,1,Pretty Boring and Worthless,"This CD compilation is actually pretty boring and tired. It's probably OK if you spend your whole life listening to top 40 radio, but if you actually have a decent collection of music, steer clear. I was fairly excited when I bought it, but when it arrived, I realized I had just foolishly bought my 5th boring compilation containing such overplayed tracks such as Thievery Corporation's ""The Glass Bead Game"", and K+D's ""Original Bedroom Rockers"". I mean, come on. All the music on this two disk set was pretty cool several years ago. But now you here it everywhere from Lexus commercials to Levi's ads.The real shame here is that record companies are always going to put out lame, boring stuff as long as some dumb sap is stupid enough to buy it. In this case, the dumb sap is ME. Don't do the same thing to yourself. Go pick up something good instead, like one of the Naked Music compilations (Nude Dimensions 1-3, Carte Blanche, etc.), Om Lounge, Paris Lounge, etc."
869,1,part thre and one are identical,"Of this symphonie, part 3 and one are identical. Above that there is some coughing in this music. The pace I think is not right. Compare this bargain to other recordings and you will notice that it is not bad. Some explanation about Cesare Cantieri and Suddeutsche Philharmonie would not be out of place. It is good to begin with, but i for myself have abandonned this recording for other interpretations by Daniel Barenboim and/or Vladimir Delman. One can obrtain these recordings from second sound shops. For the long term, that would be better. Elegant music= Yes. More than that no Two stars only Music quality is allright in general."
1978,2,Great bike tube,Previously I had purchases several bike tubes at Walmart and they didn't last very long. A bike rider recommended this brand and I'm pleased that I followed his recommendation. This tube is superior to other tubes purchased in the past.
2456,1,Cookbook for me,"I'm so glad I purchased this book for myself because I took the word of a used book seller that it was in 'Like New' condition. Big mistake. The whole spine was broken away from the book, and it was shipped in a PAPER BAG. Don't most people ship in a carton??? Lesson learned. I repaired it, but will never order a used book again. Martha Schulz"
3865,2,Nice,Using this book for a class. Got here on time and am very happy with how the book is so far. No problems.
2212,2,"A ""Home Run""","Randy Spitzer and Rob Lebow hit a ""home run"" as far as my clients are concerned in their new book, ""Accountability"".There are so many great illustrations throughout the book to guide you. It's clear today that the way to true success for organizations is to implement freedom and responsibility without control if you truly want to win in the market, community, company and with your customers.The only reason anyone would not see the purity of the ideas and strong possibilities for helping your culture pay is because they are struggling to give up control. It's been a mantra of business for generations - this kind of thinking is destructive.So freedom and responsibility without control is the future and the future is now. Again, well done again - can't wait for your next book!Rich RowePresidentAmerican Advancement Institute"
1006,2,A good bottle to run with,"I've been using this bottle on every run I go on for the last 5 months. Anywhere from 5-15 mile runs. It is comfortable to carry, doesn't leak, and is easy to open and close. I am able to stuff 3 gels in the pocket with some cash. Alternately, I carry cash and my car key in the pocket. Sometimes it gets a little smelly, but you can easily remove the bottle holder and throw it in the washing machine. Only thing I can see that would make it better is that if it were insulated in some way. Since the bottle is in contact with your hand, cold water only stays cold about 20 minutes."
3047,2,Sunday morning CD,"This Bill Evans CD is a classic. If you don't have this, please order a copy today. Steven"
705,1,Don't waste your time,This DVD is a total waste of time. It shows her going to a garage sale buying only stuff with name brands or markings and then hoping what she bought will sell on ebay. common sense stuff! Don't bother.
3143,1,"Enough about Michelle, what about Jeff???","Yes, Michelle P. seems to be every man's fantasy, but for me, a female, check out the way Jeff seduces her by the piano! I met Jeff B. and he must be 6'4""...and sexy. The music tops it all off...Grusin, good job."
3596,2,Great movie,I really loved this movie! It's a movie that just makes you feel good. You can watch it over and over again. The movie was in great condition when received and the price was great.
1987,2,Raise your thumbs!,I really liked this album. I watched the ballet and the music really fits. You should listen to this; it is a good CD in the classical area.A very moving piece of music!Enjoy!
179,1,Mater & McQueen clock a bust,"I sent this clock back. The volumn of the alarm was way too loud and you could not change it, it scared my son who is not usually scared by loud noises. Also it was very hard to set the time, date etc and very easy to change it on accident. Even my sone who loves Cars and everything about it, he is 5, asked me to send it back."
109,2,Very Enlightening,"Before reading this book, I did not know the difference between a buccaneer and a pirate. I thought they were one and the same. Thanks to Marrin, I now understand the difference.With so little known about Captain Morgan before he made a name for himself as a buccaneer, I believe Marrin does an excellent job in setting the scene by describing the world Morgan lived in. Without going over-the-top, he adequately describes the political and social scene of the day however fair or unjust it may have been. He also gives a good impression of the many injustices that were accepted as part of everyday life that are very difficult for us to comprehend today (e.g., slavery, torture, terrorism, etc.).After reading this book, I understand why Morgan was hailed as a hero in England at the time, but it is also very clear why the Spanish compared him to the Devil."
3078,2,Echobelly's best yet.,"Echobelly have grown yet again. Time has honed their style and let them produce their best album to date. Sonya Aurora Madan's angelic voice sweeps you through her songs, with her dazzling lyrics and captivating ideas, until you are singing at the top of your lungs and even accompanying Glenn Johansson on his flying guitar riffs. This album has everything, from the unbelievably catchy ""Iris Art"", ""Everyone Knows Better"" and ""I'm Not A Saint"", to the soulfull accoustics of ""Bleed"" and ""Falling Flame""; from the frantic ( you better not drive while playing this ) pace of ""Drive Myself Distracted"", ""Holding The Wire"" and the unparalleled ""Mouth Almighty"" to the majesty of the orchestra that accompanies in ""Wired On."" I warn everyone now not to play this album before taking a shower as your voice ( and you will be singing ) could travel for miles through the pipes."
1055,1,A very bad book!,"The concepts are presented in a chaotic manner, without small and clear samples. The book could have some value only for html programmers that just want to broaden their knowledge a little bit. ..."
3952,1,Poor Quality.... Stinks in days..,This is of poor quality. It worked only for 2 weeks. It started stinking and noticed mold formation. Even after I changed the water multiple times.
314,2,Stunning!,My well worn paperback of TLD says all that needs saying about this amazing book. I weep for the future of sci-fi/fantasy if TLD is not brought back into print. Dan: This story is a gem. Don't give up on us; we're not going anywhere.
1822,1,"Not much new info for me, but good for younger person possibly","The first couple chapters were interesting, but then it seemed like something I might have found useful about 15 years ago. If you have read any of the more popular PUA books or social dynamic stuff, this is way on the novice end in comparison. Also it is co-written by a woman, so if you are interesting in using it to meet women, it is mostly useless. There were some good bits of info, such as what men find attractive vs what women do, but seems like a better read for a high school age person just learning to talk to girls."
567,1,Do not buy this product!!!,"I am extremely disappointed with this product. After using the 1 package of film that is provided, I found it impossible to find film for it. I called Radica Games to complain; only to find out this product has been discontinued. It has been discontinued because Polaroid now distributes this film only on a limited basis. Limited basis means that it is on its way to being phased out. This film is available on line or at a few retailers (but that does not mean you will find it in stock). I find it reprehensible that Amazon and Toy R Us are still carrying this product and selling it for full price knowing the product has been discontinued and not informing the consumer. Buyer beware!!"
879,2,YOU WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER DISH BRUSH AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!,"I bought this item in March of 2011.Almost 2 years later, and with CONSTANT, REGULAR, FREQUENT daily use in our business office kitchen, the bristles have kept their integrity.This is wholly unlike most dish brushes which lose their shape and become annoyingly flat on the side you use the most, thereby rendering the brush USELESS.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The only note for potential buyers is the brush I bought 2 years ago had a completely black handle, not the black/white one shown in the photo, so don't be shocked if you get something different!"
2230,2,Great,"My parents dragged me with them to see this in the theater, and I was blown away. The catchy tunes and great dance steps won't soon be forgotten."
1411,1,hot garbage,"FIRST OF ALL THESE KATS GET CARRIED NUMEROUS OF TIMES, THEN THEYRESPONSES ARE WACK, BEATS ARE LAIM,#1 OF THEM ALL, BROWNOSING WITH 112 ON VIDEOS THAT MY FRIENDS IS OUT 4 REAL."
3224,2,Great Quality Knives,"This knife set was purchased for my son, who works in an upscale restaurant. He absolutely loves the knives. He raves about the balance and how easy they are to use. The knives are sharp. He also loves the look of the carrying case. I don't know anything about knives, but he especially loves the knife he uses for slicing cheese. Soft cheese residue does not clog up the blade while he is slicing. They are advertised as having a lifetime warranty. The quality and workmanship suggest they will last a lifetime."
3936,2,A REAL EXPERT SPILLS THE BEANS!,"It is obvious from the beginning of this book that the author is not only truly experienced but is revealing some REAL INSIDER INFO! So many of these mail-order books just rehash the same tired junk...not this one! Mr. Thomas lets you in on the inside and lays it all out in a simple, easy to follow step-by-step method. Anyone of average intelligence could use his techniques to make some REAL MONEY in mail order. i truly great piece of work!"
3249,2,"Perfect, but for the mattress size","Great crib, easy to put together, and very pretty. Our baby is not here yet so we haven't used the crib. For now, we like it!Sole issue: not all mattresses fit. We bought an oversize mattress and it fit with sheets and a breathable bumper -but without it the mattress moved a little bit and that freaked me out a bit (I had just taken a class of SIDS and the nurse told her that the mattress must absolutely fit snugly).So... Overall great crib but why the heck would the company not make this crib standard size??"
929,2,Maori Magnifico,Absolutely a great find. I'm glad I grabbed this one. It has a lot of relevance to todays tatooes.
2578,1,DO NOT BUY THIS PANASONIC DVD,I bought this Panasonic DVD recorder DMR-ES10 because Amazon customers said the picture quality was good. Not so! Compared to the TV image direct from cable the image quality from this recorder is flat and grayish. faces show yelowish instead of pinkish without highlights. The manual is written by people who understand the machine but do not have a clue how to write for first time buyers.
3379,1,THIS IS A HORRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY,"I recently bought this item at a locaL toysrus store, I went home and hooked it up, i started adjusting the brightness and the machine broke. Now my brand spanking new t.v is ruined!!!"
2292,1,marylandman,"Came without safety key. Would not start or run once B&D sent the key. Buy in a store, if you must, so you can return it."
1502,2,Affordable Milk Frother,"Works great every time. This is an affordable way to make a nice latte at home. It's very compact, easy to clean, and can be easily stored in small or tight kitchens. I've paid over $60 for a froth maker 2 years ago that did not even work; however, for less than $20 this one is perfect."
3782,2,The Very Best of Ann Margret,I love the sultry way she sings. She is so cute. Some of the songs I had never heard before.
605,1,Not good.,"Here we are the 2nd week of school and turns out I was sent the WRONG book. And, as it's not anything I thought to check-via the publisher page listing of the ISBN number, I don't have any of the return shipping labels required for me to return this book. So I'll get to purchase the book again.ISBN should have been 0130366145 and I got ISBN 0131663054 which is missing 2 full sections required for the course."
1988,1,surprised,"I read this book and this reader thought it was very poorly written and hard to read. It went in circles and at times I was wondering what I had read and would go back and read it over and over, and most of the time I never did figure it out. I was surprised I expected this to be a good and well written book."
14,2,Awesome cd.,"This cd was easily one of the best releases last year so i had to post a review. From beginning to end every song is catchy yet in your face and thats the best way to do it. The lyrics are insane, guitar work is insane, drums insane. the riff in stab.stab.stab will not leave your head believe me.100/5 stars"
1261,1,Overheats like madddd,"Unfortunately this card overheated within 3 minutes of playing any recent game. Crysis, Call of Duty 4, even Heroes of Might and Magic. Returned for replacement, got another one and it lasted about 2 minutes longer. It didn't just lock up my computer, it shut it down completely. Also made crackling sounds come out of my speakers when I had headphones in."
3238,1,"Interesting,but not great.","This was an interesting look into the life of a Geisha,but not a great novel. Where is the passion? Definitely not from a womans perspective."
3318,1,Not what I expected,"I have enjoyed several of Annes vampire books and decided to give this a try. I am not into torture and humiliation and this book is packed with both. I do enjoy a very steamy romance which is what I thought I would be reading. It was difficult to even get to the mid point of the book which is where I am now and I find the only thing that encourages me to read on is the hope that at some point the prince and all of his ... kingdom will get whats coming to them. If you are thinking of buying this because you like a romance with some eroticism in it this is not the book for you. The entire book is filled with absolute cruelty and .... On the other hand, if thats what you're into then this is the book for you."
8,2,Love this oven.,"I purchased this oven for my camper in 2009. I absolutely love it it works great for bread, bread pudding, buiscuts, pinapple upsidedown cake, lasagna, pies and everything else I have tried. I even bring it in the house from time to time when we are having a big family dinner as an extra oven. It is great little oven and I would highly recommend this unit."
889,1,"Good guide for sightseeing, but NOT for hotels, restaurants","While this book provides fairly accurate guidance regarding natural features and campgrounds, don't use it a reliable guide to travel necessities that are market driven like hotels, restaurants, admission costs, etc. Each time we used the book to choose a hotel, we were surprised and sadly disappointed in either the quality, the cost, or both. The same for recommended restaurants. Admission costs were generally 20% higher than listed. No big deal, but again, for a current publication it fell short in accuracy. It's as if an earlier printing was simply published as current without checking on the accuracy of the contents.Use it as a guide, but not as a reference. I'm sure there are other sources of more accurate information for travelers."
3148,2,"Tough, high-quality chain lock","This is a great, easy to use chain lock. I can't think of a single design flaw with it. The only drawback is that it's heavy - very heavy. It's long enough that I can use it to lock up both of my bikes together, which is very convenient."
3551,2,The little radio that good,Excellet little radio for the price. Replaced my 30 year old transitor radio like a charm and get me connected during power outage.
1444,2,Really liked it!,My 2nd Kay Scapetta novel and loved it. She is a terrific author and never ceases to amaze me. Liked the Key West theme.
393,1,What A Pity!,"It's too bad Backstreet's career is over. I'll miss them, especially since I've been such a loyal fan since they came onto the scene in '91. The first two albums were so incredible, I couldn't believe how bad this was. Their voices are still great, but they shouldn't be allowed to write music. ""I Want It That Way"" was so perfect. I couldn't have been more dissappointed in ""Shape of My Heart."" ""The Call"" has to be the dumbest song I've ever heard, ""you're dropping out my battery is low, just so you know we're going to a place near by, gotta go."" I'm not kidding, that's really part of the chorus! The only listenable song here is ""Get Another Boyfriend"" the rest is just- BORING!Get ""This Time Around"" ""No Strings Attached"" or ""Sooner or Later"" if you're looking for a boy band worth listening to."
1582,2,hilarious,*insert ass joke here* this game is fun and hilarious! One of the better family games out right now! Love.
2858,2,A great story that keeps you interested.,This novel is similiar to all of the FBI series in the good versus evil storyline and the romance vein keeps is interesting as well.
538,2,Good YA Sci-Fi,"Second in the Trilogy. Tally becomes a Pretty, but it's not everything that she thought it would be. Somehow she has thought her way out of being Pretty-Minded and is once again out to find the New Smoke to join them, to help them and to live a life outside of the City. She and Zane risk their lives to join up with David only to find out that the Specials have a whole new way to find them. Tally once again betrays and is betrayed. I'm enjoying this series. I'm not much of a science fiction reader, so to me this is Sci-Fi-Lite. This book took a little longer to get going, but the story did move a long. Hopefully book 3 will answer the questions."
1487,2,Best Acting in a Space Saga,"Any time a movie is made based on a television series, the production faces an additional dilemma: how to bring new viewers up to speed without boring series fans to tears. ""Serenity"" manages to do a fine job, those new to the Firefly saga quickly learn the essential backstory while hardcore fans are still entertained during the formative part of the film. This is no mean feat, given the size of the ensemble cast.The element that sets this movie apart from all the other tales of space and sci-fi on film is the acting. Taking the well-formed and interesting characters created by Whedon, the cast really makes them appealing and identifiable. You feel like you actually known these people and you understand their actions and emotions. Hopefully the surviving cast will have the opportunity to reprise their roles in a sequel or two or three. Much like a couple of other space flick franchises, only better. Much, much better."
807,2,I was 6 yrs old when my mother took we to see this!,This was the first movie my mother and grandmother took me to see. I have never been to a indoors movie before. I enjoyed watching all the stories but the one who took my heart away was elves! I have the album that was sold from the movie. This is a keeper!
3414,2,Very Cool,"This vest was better than I expected. The product is the same as the picture. The vest is fully adjustable, and great for running around during airsoft games."
798,1,This is garbage!!,"Wow, they actually put this ""anti-classic"" on CD. Seriously, this is a very bad album. Practically none of the ""superstars"" can sing, other than Jimmy Hart, and they are mostly stuck with dumb novelty songs. Not that they fare too well when they sing ""serious"" songs. Nikolai Volkoff has a decent baritone voice, but his thick accent renders ""Cara Mia"" unintelligible. Probably the worst singing here is by Roddy Piper, although Captain Lou Albano gives him a run for the money. If you are a fan of bad celebrity singing, you should get this album."
3539,1,"Great Movie, but this VHS Tape is Awful","After years of trying to get a copy of this wonderful movie and checking on Amazon, suddenly it became available on VHS at Amazon last summer and I ordered a copy. What arrived, is NOT an original studio release. Instead it was a generic tape with a typed white label. When I put it in to view, what I found was a very grainy image with a dubbed English soundtrack. I was very disappointed.My guess is that someone found a copy of the 1972 poor U.S. release at a flea market somewhere and has taken a position that the copyright has entered the public domain after 28 years as per statutory section 17 USC 303 of the copyright law and is publishing copies of that worn out flea market copy."
1815,1,Mindless Entertainment,"The Klone And I is a silly story of a love triangle between Stephanie,Peter and Peter's clone,Paul.The novel is simply outrageous and provides mindless entertainment.Too bad that this book got published.This is arguably the worst Danielle Steel novel I have ever read."
2329,1,"Oh, this movie is bad!","I am angry at myself for wasting an hour and half of the holiday season and spending the money on this terrible film. Bad acting, bad plot. The only redeeming aspect of the film was the handsome lead actor, but that did not make up for all the other negatives of this film. And I am someone who LOVES Christmas movies......."
2647,2,Great present,I bought this book as a Christmas present for one of my kids. I've got a copy for myself and use it often.
1424,1,Waste of Money,I thought this would be good for black outs. I paid $20 and out of the box it never worked. The White LEDs onlystay lit as long as you crank. However the worthless amber side lights will light. I threw it away the first day.
2359,2,"Great DVD, beautiful photography","Having visited Acadia National Park in Bar Harbor, ME, on more than one occasion, I was happy to have this DVD which features a great deal of history and information about the park, but even more satisfying is the stunningly beautiful photography and scenery. A first-rate production, narrated by an old pro, Jack Perkins; if you love National Parks and excellent videography, then this is a ""must have""!"
3321,2,"Fantabulous music, just like the movie.","I didn't pay much attention to the music when I saw the movie, but recently I heard Ishwar-Allah and was instantly moved by the song. Its one of the best songs I have ever heard. I have heard this song more than 20 times since yesterday and everytime I hear it, I like it even more. Anyways, that song made me listen to all the other songs and I liked Dheemi Dheemi, Ye jo jindagi hai and rut aa gayee re. Rut aa gayee re is another one that I love. Worth buying."
787,2,Under-rated,"This is probably the most underrated movie i have ever seen. I walked into a video store one weekend and couldn't find a movie to watch so the person working the counter suggested 'The Fall'. I was a bit skeptical, but this movie blew me away! I'd suggest it to anyone who enjoys breathtaking cinematography along with stunning locales. Easily my favorite movie."
1992,2,story of many perspectives,Funny how Manhatten can become a small town. At least that's Lawrence Block's premise in writing this crime drama from several folks' perspectives - folks that don't really know each other but bump into each other often. The sexual tension with Susan is pretty extreme -- pretty much an X-rated read with explicit detail.
1116,1,not a good purchase,The Coby CD/Cassette Player that we bought worked for CDs but the cassette player made a loud humming noise that we were not happy with. We returned the unit.
1320,1,Not really much help,"This book contains most of the scales, in every key, as well as most of the important chords to be used in jazz improvisation. What it doesn't contain is any guidance as to HOW to improvise successfully. While some might argue that improvisation, by definition, is something you make up yourself, I believe that a few examples would be very helpful to a beginner musician (after all, who else would want to buy this book?). Another thing, this book amazingly doesn't contain the Blues scale. Big mistake! In summing it up, I'd rather pay a few dollars more for something that lives up to its title."
3656,2,Very good and dependable material !!,"There is not that many books out there that covers the extensive topic of qualifying for the CCIE written.This book is well written for readers to know all the topics involve in the exam.With this reference and a combined additional resources from author like Jeff Doyle , Cisco press and Cisco technology page you'll definitely pass.Great work John S. ."
1552,2,An excellent book to learn ABAP,"The explanation of the ABAP syntax and commands is good. Even if you are experienced in ABAP, I guess there's something in the book that you do not know and is worth a perusal. It would have been better if the author would have included BDC, Dynpros also."
32,1,"Well, I'll admit that I purchased the thing used...",Maybe I'm cynical...but a movie about three college students going out into some woods and yelling at each oher? This is entertainment?
